    "text": "Part 1 Apollo found amusement in many things. From music to games of skill to his long line of lovers, he found ways to pass his godly time when his father did not have tasks for him to complete, or, more often, when he did not feel like completing them. One particular way that the golden youth spent his time was with visits to mortal kingdoms. Apollo wondered how not a single place could rival his home up on Olympus in neither size nor in beauty. Today was a day that Apollo found nothing of interest. His lyre strings had been plucked until his ears were bored with the stale melodies, and his arrows had been fired until he was sick of hearing the thwack that accompanied a flawless shot. He begged his sister to help him find something of entertainment, but she just scoffed and left with her hunters. Thus, he found himself in Sparta, walking through the village and smiling charmingly at everyone he passed. Apollo knew the way he looked; an expensive silk chiton draped flatteringly over his shoulder, sunkissed skin stretched over flat muscle, sky blue eyes that shone with intelligence, and golden locks gleaming in the sunlight. He knew that beauty was enough to make almost anyone do almost anything, and this trip was no exception. Merchants offered him the finest clothes and jewels, insisting no charge. Girls tossed their hair and batted their eyelashes. Youths ran up to him, asking him to come play their sports. Apollo loved knowing mortals would treat him like this, loved knowing that they would always give him something to do. His looks didn't quite match up to Aphrodite or any of her gorgeous offspring, but he certainly came close. Eventually, a young girl, no older than thirteen or fourteen, approached him. An old woman not far behind. \"Excuse me!\" she called. Her bare feet slid against the dirt as she reached him, dust clouding around her. She didn't pay any mind. Apollo scanned her, noting the thin, rose gold circlet that sat in her chocolate curls. A princess then. \"Yes, fair maiden?\" he responded, a smile taking up his face. She faltered, a hand coming up to card through her hair. She glanced around, as if she had forgotten what she was going to say. Apollo didn't blame her; his radiance was rather distracting. \"Um...\" \"Princess Polyboea!\" The servant finally caught up to her, grabbing her on the shoulder. \"Don't run off like that! Your father would have my head if I lost you.\" At the mention of her father, the Princess came back to herself. \"Oh, yes!\" Polyboea smiled at Apollo, disregarding her servant, much to her chagrin. \"I was wondering if you would like to come back to the castle with me! My father would be pleased to have you.\" Apollo smiled at her charmingly, and she preened under the attention. \"I would love to, Princess. Lead the way.\" She brightened, and turned, skipping along the path that, presumably, went to the castle. Apollo matched her stride with graceful ease, laughing at the childlike excitement that was rolling off of her. If people had been looking before, now they were downright staring at the combined force of a princess and a god (although his divinity was unknown to them.) Apollo ignored them, instead opting to listen to Polyboea chatter on about this and that while her servant sighed with exasperation. Finally, they reached the gates of the palace. Polyboea ran in, her hair bouncing against her shoulders. She turned, gesturing around the large expanse. \"Welcome to our gardens! We house some of the finest flowers in all of Greece.\" Apollo had to admit that the space was rather beautiful, for a mortal realm. The garden keepers in Olympus would be shamed if the flowers looked like this, but he bit his tongue. They continued the tour, eventually making their way inside the castle. Polyboea immediately led them into the throne room so Apollo could meet her parents. When they entered, his eyes took in the lavish decor. The ceiling was low vaulted and had windows that let in the natural sunlight. Lining the way to the center of the room were several carefully carved white pillars. The walls were decorated with murals of former rulers and battles won. In the center of the room, there were two thrones, where the King Amyclas and Queen Diomede sat. They were talking to a boy, their son most likely. His shoulders were broad and tan, his face chiseled with beauty in the way that princes were. At the sound of the doors opening, the three of them turned. Polyboea ran up to them, her feet padding along the smooth marble floor. \"Mother, father!\" she called excitedly. \"I found this man in the marketplace and invited him over! Isn't he beautiful?\" Apollo smiled at the compliment, stepping forward and leaning down onto one knee. It wasn't common practice for him to bow to others, but he would now. \"Your Majesties, it is wonderful to be in your palace. Your daughter is as gorgeous as she is kind.\" He flashed a glance in her direction. Polyboea fiddled with her hair, biting her lip. Diomede smiled at him, standing from her spot. \"Oh, that is very sweet of you, stranger.\" She placed a hand against her heart. \"I can tell you are a man of good character, so you are welcome with open arms. We are very glad to have you in our home. If you wish to stay the night, we can have our servants prepare you a room.\" Apollo nodded, and her smile widened. \"Wonderful!\" She clapped once, a servant moving from their spot next to her to put together his bed chambers. The Queen gestured in front of her. \"This is our son, Argalus, the heir.\" \"It is very nice to meet you, Argalus.\" Apollo bowed his head, and the Prince nodded curtly in response, not saying a word more. Apollo turned his attention back to the Queen. \"If it is alright with you, I think I would like to spend more time in your beautiful garden until dinner is prepared.\" Diomede gestured for him to go. He turned his attention to Polyboea. \"Thank you for bringing me here, Princess.\" She nodded, her cheeks flushing pink slightly. Apollo exited the throne room, going back out into the expanse of flora. He had to admit, the gardens were rather nice. They were sectioned off in tiers, surrounded by pillars and statues carved out of marble. The flowers bloomed fragrant and plentiful, almost every color imaginable curling along the floors, a simple dirt path leading in between them. Apollo appreciated anything that thrived in his sunlight, so he adored plants. While he was walking through an upper level, he heard the sound of someone humming. Apollo followed the noise, moving to the edge of the section and peering through the columns to get a good look. What he saw made his heart pound. There, sitting in the grass plucking flowers, was the prettiest mortal boy Apollo had ever seen. His hair sat on his head in chestnut curls that caught the sun. His chiton was a shade of lilac, and he had a purple flower resting behind his ear. There were bands of gold that encircled his wrists, ankles, and biceps, extenuating the lean muscle there. And his face. If Apollo thought Argalus had the face of a prince, he hadn't seen anything yet. This boy was so beautiful that he was close to almost being godly. Apollo wondered if, perhaps, this was some sort of secret child of Aphrodite. Apollo, putting on his most radiant smile, stepped down through the pillars. At the sound of rustling grass, the boy turned, his face melting from surprise to dazzled bewilderment in a matter of seconds. Apollo pulled his hair out of his eyes in a practiced, careless movement, stepping closer towards the Prince. \"Hello,\" he said, tone silky. \"I am a guest staying in your fine castle, and I thought it would be amiss of me to not introduce myself. What is your name, if you don't mind my asking?\" \"Um...\" The Prince fumbled, clearly thrown off by the alluring beauty before him. Apollo's mouth ticked up in amusement; he had never managed to get this strong of a reaction from someone so handsome. \"I...m-my name is, um, Hyacinthus.\" His voice was soft and rich, sweeter than anything Apollo had ever heard. \"Hyacinthus?\" Apollo moved to sit down beside him. \"That's a lovely name.\" Hyacinthus glanced up at him through his bangs, golden light of the fading evening catching his eyes, and making them even more enchanting. \"...What is your name?\" Apollo opened his mouth, a lie on his tongue, but he was interrupted by a yell carrying through the garden, breaking the moment. \"Hyacinthus!\" a feminine voice cried out. \"It's time for dinner!\" \"Ah, coming Leanira!\" Hyacinthus stood, brushing himself off. He looked down at Apollo, who was still lounging against the grass, and extended a hand. \"Come with me, I can show you the way to the dining hall.\" The dining hall, as it turned out, was less of a hall and more of an outdoor area protected from the sun by a roof supported by several pillars. There were two long tables parallel to one another, where six royal children already sat. At the head of each table were the Queen and King. Amyclas looked up to the sound of padding feet, a smile stealing across his face when he saw the pair. \"Ah, Hyacinthus, thank you for showing our guest the way.\" Amyclas turned his attention to Apollo. \"I hope he wasn't any trouble?\" It was asked in a light tone but clearly asked another, deeper question beneath it. He didn't cause any problems, did he? Hyacinthus looked at him, his eyes filled with fear at his answer, but Apollo just continued to smile sunnily. \"He was a splendid guide.\" He waved a hand through the air, as if to brush off the notion, and Hyacinthus relaxed by his side, so subtly that no one else noticed. They took their places at the end of the table, pulling their plates of meat and bread towards them. Apollo smiled at him over his plate, and Hyacinthus glanced away, his cheeks filling with an appealing flush. He believed that he was going to have a nice time here. Part 2 Apollo stayed for a week, then two. He explored the entirety of the gardens, strolled around the lavish halls of the palace, and visited the outer-city and the market often. The family all warmed up to him, waving a hand when he passed them. All of them, except for one. Hyacinthus didn't talk to him after that night at dinner. Whenever he saw him, his cheeks would flare pink, and he would be gone before Apollo could get a single word out. This frustrated him, of course. All Apollo wanted to do was just talk to Hyacinthus, that was half the reason he was still here, but it seemed like the Prince himself was intent on making sure that didn't happen. Why did the fates hate him? It wasn't until seventeen days, twelve hours, and twenty-two minutes after meeting Hyacinthus the first time-who was counting, though-that Apollo got his first lucky break. He had woken early to watch the rising of Helios's chariot, dawn touching the sky with her soft pinks and oranges, when he was bumped into by the King and his youngest son. \"So sorry, sir,\" Amyclas said, patting him on the shoulder. Hyacinthus averted his eyes, but bowed his head slightly in apology. Apollo released an easy laugh, bright as golden bells. The two of them relaxed instinctively. \"It's quite alright, my good King! I was just enjoying this beautiful sunrise. Although, I do wonder what the two of you are doing up so early.\" His eyes caught on the cloak Hyacinthus was wearing; a traveler's garment. \"I was just seeing my son off on a journey to the surrounding city. Some matters that need to be attended to.\" The King placed a hand on the Prince's shoulder. Hyacinthus flinched under the weight of it. Apollo raised a single brow. \"Really? I would've expected Argalus to be the one handling matters such as those, considering he is the heir.\" \"Well normally he would, but he is a bit busy currently with other, more pressing matters. I thought I might use this as an opportunity to introduce Hyacinthus here to some of the duties of being a prince. It's not too important that he does it correctly, anyways.\" That last part was said quietly, but heard nonetheless. Apollo looked at Hyacinthus, his features etched with embarrassment and shame, and was struck with a sudden idea. \"Well, I'm no prince, but I do come from a noble family.\" This, of course, was half a lie, as the Olympians were the highest royalty there was. \"I could come with him and show him the ropes, perhaps?\" Hyacinthus looked up suddenly, eyes wide and cheeks rosy. Amyclas didn't notice, a smile stealing across his face. \"Why, that's a wonderful idea!\" He clapped his hands together. \"As long as you don't mind?\" Apollo shook his head. \"Not at all.\" Hyacinthus didn't speak to him until they were well out of the castle, buildings in sight. The entire walk over, Apollo could feel the tension radiating off of him. \"What do you want from me?!\" Finally, Hyacinthus snapped, stopping in place along the path. Apollo turned to face him, feigning innocence. \"Whatever do you mean?\" Hyacinthus's right eye twitched slightly. Apollo had to bite back laughter at the reaction. \"Ever since you came here, you've been following me non-stop. Constantly three paces behind me in the gardens, or sitting down next to me at dinner, or...this!\" Hyacinthus huffed, hands thrown up in exasperation. \"Why don't you just leave me alone already?\" Apollo smiled serenely, which seemed to make the Prince more annoyed. He rolled his eyes, then shoved past him. \"I'm ignoring you.\" Apollo threw back his head and laughed, causing Hyacinthus to speed up his pace. \"Wait, no, hold on!\" Apollo ran after him, grabbing onto the back of his cloak and checking his stride. \"Prince, wait. I did not mean to offend. Will you please talk to me? I hate a silent walk, it reminds me of the numerous times my sister has been tempted to shoot me with an arrow.\" A moment of silence, then a snort of laughter. Apollo brightened with pride; he knew he was hilarious, but he enjoyed having it confirmed. \"Has she actually threatened that?\" Hyacinthus asked, amusement still evident in his tone. He turned back slightly, a sign of surrender. \"Oh, yes, on numerous occasions.\" Apollo sighed affectionately, memories of eyes as deep as the night sky glaring at him with rage that could only come from the Goddess of the Hunt herself. \"She is, frankly, terrifying.\" \"Hm.\" Hyacinthus began walking again, slow enough that Apollo could tell he was welcome to stride alongside him, which he did gladly. \"...What's the rest of your family like?\" Apollo smiled, pleased for the attention. \"Oh, where should I even begin?\" Part 3 After that day, Hyacinthus broke down his walls, little by little. He stopped avoiding Apollo, and often joined him on his walks in the garden. What used to be icy stilted silence had thawed away to warm laughter and conversation as flowing as the sweet wine at dinner. Apollo was sent with him on many diplomatic involvements, and little by little the snide remarks from Amyclas were reduced, giving way to occasional praise. Every time it happened, Hyacinthus turned towards him, his face happily flushed, causing Apollo's nonexistent heart to stutter. Hyacinthus became more comfortable with him physically, as well. Often, he would place a hand on Apollo's knee while they sat out in the gardens, or a soft hug when they woke and before they went to bed. Once, after an afternoon in the market, there was a soft press of lips to his cheek as they came up on the palace. The next second, Hyacinthus had slipped away, Apollo still stood in dazed confusion in front of the gates. It had been nearly three months. Apollo could feel it in the air, that Zeus was getting annoyed with his absence. He wouldn't be surprised if Hermes was sent looking for him soon, or at the very least Iris. It didn't matter though; he didn't want to leave yet. He wouldn't leave yet, not when there was still so much to learn about Hyacinthus. A storm rolled in, a sign of his father's bad temper. It was gone within a night, but the pounding of the rain and the crack of thunder was enough evidence that its length did not reflect its severity. The morning after, Apollo and Hyacinthus trailed after the servants who worked in the garden, helping tend to the water-tread flowers that had sunk into the supple mud. Just Apollo's divine nature was enough for them to recover quickly, basking in his glow. Amyclas ran into them that night, looking terribly frazzled. He paced up and down the hallway, muttering wildly, and barely spared the two of them a glance when they entered. \"Father, calm down, what's wrong?\" Hyacinthus walked up to him and placed a steadying hand on his forearm. The King seemed to melt under the weight of it. \"A messenger came in from one of the surrounding farm towns a few minutes ago. All the crops have been flooded.\" He raked a hand through his graying hair. \"I don't know what to do. Aragalus is away, the rest of your brothers are terribly busy with their studies, and I'm too old to make a journey that far. But if I don't send someone, then this will never be sorted out, and food won't make it out to the city...\" Amyclas trailed off, looking exceedingly more worried. Hyacinthus considered this information, tapping a finger to his cheek. \"...You could send me.\" Amyclas scrunched his nose at him, a knee-jerk reaction that he schooled off his face. \"My dear son, I know you have been doing rather well recently, but this matter is really rather delicate, and you are still not the best at negotiations.\" Hyacinthus huffed at the King's claim, crossing his arms. Apollo placed a soothing hand on his shoulder. \"I would go with him, if it makes you feel any better,\" he said. Amyclas looked up at him. \"Seeing as you don't really have any better options, I would like to be of some assistance.\" Amclas nodded slightly, placing a hand to his mouth as his muttering started again, much less frantic this time. \"Yes...I believe that could work out well. If you're there, then you can, yes...\" He smiled up at Apollo. \"This is wonderful! Thank you for your help, uh, hmm...\" The King paused, a puzzled expression on his face. \"...You know, I don't believe I ever caught your name, after all this time.\" Apollo smirked at him, bright and reassuring. Amyclas blinked against the radiance that he was off putting, his face turning relaxed and his eyes glazing over. \"I never offered it,\" Apollo responded. Amyclas nodded in a dazed fashion. \"I-yes, that seems perfectly reasonable-I do believe I may have overstepped-well, I mean I...I seem to have forgotten what we were talking about.\" Amyclas scratched his head thoughtfully. Apollo laughed. \"Oh, don't worry about that now. It is getting late, however, and we need to be off in the morning. You should go get some rest.\" He bowed to Amyclas, who nodded, a little bit hesitantly, and began walking off towards his chambers. Apollo gently pushed the space between Hyacinthus's shoulder blades, where his hand still lay. \"Come along, Prince, let me walk you to your room.\" Hyacinthus looked at him with an odd expression. \"...Okay...\" Hyacinthus said, a little questioning. Apollo brushed off the strangeness. He was probably just a little tired. The next morning, the three of them met in the courtyard. Amyclas fiddled anxiously, repeating the same instructions multiple times in a row, or checking their rations even though he had already checked twice. Apollo stroked the side of his horse's head, gently. \"Father.\" Hyacinthus caught the King's hand from where it shuffled through their bags for what had to be the fifth time. \"It will be alright. With the two of us there, what could go wrong?\" Amyclas bit his lip. \"Well, I just need to make sure that you, I mean, both of you are very competent, but...\" Amyclas trailed off, to which Hyacinthus sighed. \"Please, just put a little faith in me? Just this once?\" Hyacinthus begged. Amyclas stared at his son, eyebrows furrowed, before slowly nodding. \"I...yes, I can do that.\" He pulled his hand away, and turned to Apollo. \"You will make sure that things run smoothly?\" \"Do not fret, King. I will make it my highest priority.\" Apollo smiled at him. Amyclas nodded again, then glanced between the two. \"Okay, yes. Well, have a good journey, please come home by tomorrow evening.\" Amyclas let out a breath, then turned towards the doors. Hyacinthus bowed his head. \"...Good bye, my son.\" The next moment, he was gone. Hyacinthus heaved a heavy sigh, his shoulders drooping. He looked up at Apollo and smiled, exhaustion etched into the creases of his eyes. \"Come along, companion. It is time to begin the journey,\" Hyacinthus said, slinging his bag over his shoulder and pulling himself onto his horse's back. Apollo followed suit, and soon the two of them were on the way, easy conversation flowing between the sound of hoofs hitting well packed dirt. Somewhere on the outskirts of the city, Hyacinthus fell silent. Apollo could sense heavy tension strung through the air. He fumbled for a way to cut it. \"Um...\" Hyacinthus turned towards him, eyes flashing in the morning light. He looked almost ethereal. \"I've been wondering about why you and your father are so...?\" Apollo winced. Clearly, spending time around mortals had made him lose some of his tact. Hyacinthus turned away from him, eyes hooded. \"You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I just thought-\" \"It's alright,\" the Prince cut in. \"I'll tell you.\" He looked up at the sky where the morning light turned from golden to sweet yellow as the day wore on. \"A few years ago, my father presented me with a potential spouse. He was exuberant that his youngest son was engaged. It was my job to court her, as her father had not yet decided who she would marry. I tried as hard as I could to charm her, and I think that it would've worked out, if...\" Hyacinthus hunched his shoulders in shame. \"If I hadn't messed everything up.\" He said this last part very quietly, like he didn't want Apollo to hear. However, he heard nonetheless, his stomach twisting from the sheer pain in Hyacinthus's voice. \"Messed everything up? How?\" Hyacinthus huffed, clenching his fists. \"I wasn't interested in her, but I figured that it was better to go along with my father's whims. However, the night that I was supposed to ask for her father's hand in marriage, I began to feel guilty. She was always so happy to see me, and I could not return the feeling. I thought she might understand, so I told her my woes, hoping she would still marry me even if I did not love her.\" He bit his lip. \"I still remember her running off, crying.\" Apollo watched him, a crease in between his brows. \"So...then what happened?\" \"I was so ashamed that I went home without even talking to the King. My father was furious with me. He wouldn't talk to me for months. I might've even been thrown out if it hadn't been for my mother. And now...\" Hyacinthus broke off with a sigh. \"Well, I think you get the idea.\" Apollo turned away from him, considering. \"...Once my father actually did throw me out.\" Hyacinthus turned to him in shock. \"Really? You?\" Apollo laughed at that. \"Yes, me. He was furious with me, and he sent me to live with some farmers for a few months until he deemed it appropriate for me to return.\" He smiled fondly at the memory. \"An overreaction, if you ask me, but he seemed to think it was necessary.\" Apollo felt a measure of pride rush through him when a small grin stole across Hyacinthus's face. \"I just didn't really expect you to be the type who gets in trouble. You just seem so...good.\" Apollo giggled, considering how untrue that statement was. \"You would be surprised.\" He sighed, a lazy smile spreading across his face. \"Although, he never tried to get me to marry.\" \"Oh.\" Hyacitnhus stroked his fingers mindlessly over the hair of his horse's neck mindlessly. \"Why not?\" \"It was never very important to him,\" he responded. \"Although, that doesn't mean I haven't pursued romance.\" Apollo let out a breezy laugh. Hyacinthus was silent for several moments, and when Apollo looked over, he almost looked embarrassed. \"What about you?\" Apollo saw Hyacinthus flinch at the question. \"What about me?\" \"Well, I know there was that Princess, but have you ever pursued romance, just for, you know, yourself?\" Hyacinthus began to shake his head, and then stopped, face considering. \"...Kind of?\" Apollo smirked at him. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" \"Well...\" He raked a hand through his hair. \"There was an event, but...it's not what you're talking about.\" Apollo raised an eyebrow. \"Elaborate?\" Hyacinthus glanced up at him, licking his bottom lip. \"...You're not the first person who visited the palace recently. Last summer, there was another nobleman, who I ended up becoming quite close to.\" Apollo felt his eyes widen, his stomach twisting just barely. \"Really?\" Hyacinthus nodded. \"Yes. I loved his company; I thought of him as my closest friend and I thought he felt similar, but one day he...\" Hyacinthus paused, swallowing, and then abruptly switching topics. \"At some point, he told me he was a god. Zephyrus, the West Wind.\" Apollo tried to suppress the scowl threatening to take over his face. \"I accepted it quickly. It didn't make him a different person, was what I thought. But then...\" This time, when he paused, he didn't start again. \"Then?\" Apollo prompted. \"He told me was in love with me,\" he said this quietly, as if he couldn't bear to admit it. \"And when I couldn't return his feelings, he...\" Hyacinthus sucked in a breath. \"He was angry. He told me that I was being selfish, and that I would never find anyone like him, because he was divine.\" His fists had curled into fists, knuckles white. \"Finally, he left, but he told me that when I came to my senses, I could call upon him. I spent the rest of that summer locked away in my room, I couldn't stand to face anyone.\" \"Oh, Hyacinthus,\" Apollo sighed, wishing he could reach out and embrace him. \"It was not your fault, you know.\" Hyacinthus gave a slight nod. \"Of course he would be like this,\" Apollo mumbled, hoping it wouldn't be heard. To no avail. \"What do you mean, 'he would be like this'?\" Hyacinthus narrowed his eyes at him. Apollo fumbled for a plausible explanation. \"Oh, well, that's just what I've heard. You know, how people talk about the Gods.\" Hyacinthus furrowed his brows. \"...Right.\" The air between them hung heavy and quiet for a moment, suspicion apparent in Hyacinthus' face. Apollo felt discomfort creep through him, spreading over every inch of his body. \"Anyways, how about we talk about something more pleasant?\" he finally said, if only to fill the itching silence. Hyacinthus narrowed his eyes. \"How-how far are we from our destination?\" The heavy gaze was finally broken, the Prince looking out to the horizon. \"Still at least half a day's journey. We'll need to stop to eat soon.\" \"Oh, can we stop soon? I'm starving!\" Apollo dramatically flung a hand to his forehead. An incredulous laugh left Hyacinthus' mouth. \"We had breakfast an hour ago!\" Apollo grinned at him. Hyacinthus rolled his eyes, and the previous conversation was forgotten. They reached the nearest village hours later, when the sun began to sink below the horizon. The two were led to a small set of dingy stables on the edge of the town where they kept their horses. Hyacinthus grinned at Apollo as they walked out, heading to the first plot of land that was affected. They did that for the rest of the evening, going around town and asking the farmers what supplies they would need to get their growth back on track after the storm. When they were finished, they took a stroll around, chatting amicably about nothing at all. Apollo led them away from the actual community at some point, and into the thick forest to the west of the village. \"My mother used to take me and my siblings here all the time,\" Hyacinthus said as they weaved through trees. The last of the sun's honey glow had faded, leaving nothing but the moon's silver light peeking through the leaves. \"I don't remember why, but when we had the time, we would take trips out here and stay in the forest for a day. Back when I was still small enough to ride on the back of a cart.\" Apollo considered this. \"My father never took me anywhere. I went where I pleased, sometimes with my sister, sometimes with one of my half brothers. My family was never close enough to all go anywhere together.\" \"What about your mother?\" Hyacinthus looked up at him through thick lashes. \"I was not allowed to see my birth mother often, and my step-mother, well...\" Apollo trailed off, thinking of Hera's cold sneer whenever she saw him. \"She was not exactly fond of me, being one of her husband's bastard children.\" \"Oh.\" Hyacinthus was reduced to silence by that, eyes contemplative. \"It's alright, though,\" Apollo intercepted. \"I still have my siblings. And besides, if I was not able to go where I pleased, I would never have met you.\" Hyacinthus smiled at him, but he seemed quiet for the rest of the walk. Little over five minutes later, the trees parted, giving way to clearing where the canopy broke. The moonlight shining down on the grass made it almost look blue. \"Beautiful,\" Apollo breathed, stepping into the ring of trees. \"The perfect place to practice archery, or play discus.\" He tapped a finger to his lips. \"Hyacinthus, do you think we could-\" He turned on his foot, a smile on his face, but it faded when he saw Hyacinthus's expression. It was tight and confused, and a little bit hurt. Apollo walked closer to him gingerly. \"Hyacinthus, what is wrong?\" Hyacinthus looked at him, eyes searching. Evidently, he didn't find what he wanted, because he looked back down at the ground, a sigh on his lips. \"Hyacinthus?\" \"I think I know what you are.\" The statement was sudden, seemingly out of nowhere. Apollo nearly took a step back at the conviction that overtook his features. He swallowed. \"Really?\" he asked. Hyacinthus nodded. \"Whatever do you mean?\" \"I mean...\" Hyacinthus pulled at his hair, pacing. \"There are all these things about you. Like how you've never told anyone your name, despite being here for so long, or the stories you tell about your family, or the way...\" Hyacinthus trailed off clearly embarrassed. \"...The way you look, and how everyone treats you. Sometimes, it seems like you change everyone's mood with a smile. And when we discussed Zephyrus, you almost acted like you've met him.\" Apollo's shoulders were drawn up to his ears, nerves flaring. \"...So, what do you think I am?\" he finally mustered up the courage to ask. Hyacinthus clenched his eyes shut for just a second, and then looked up, surety in every inch of his features. \"You're a god, aren't you?\" Time simultaneously seemed to stop and speed up all at once, an eternity wrapped in what could only be a few seconds. The wind quit whistling, and the trees stopped swaying. In that instant, the world was quiet, listening. Apollo finally broke the silence after another moment with a sigh. \"...It would be easy to deny, but it is true. I am a god, the God Apollo.\" He clenched his fists as he said it, looking to the ground in shame. Hyacinthus nodded, resigned, then kept nodding, bracing himself against a tree. Apollo could see in the faint silver moonlight that his eyes had become glassy. He nearly took a step forward, to try to comfort, but thought better of it. \"Listen, Hyacinthus, I didn't mean to...I mean, I didn't know about what Zephryus...you have to understand-\" Apollo stopped when he heard a watery chuckle, then another. He stared at Hyacinthus in shock as he dissolved into nearly hysterical laughter. \"Hyacinthus?\" \"Gods, just shut up,\" Hyacinthus cut in, gulping for air. There were still traces of amusement in his tone. \"You -you are just such an idiot. I can't even believe it, you are so stupid.\" In one quick movement, he pulled himself away from the bark of the tree he was leaning on, striding over to Apollo. \"What are you-\" Hyacinthus grabbed the front of his chiton, pulling him down. His lips were soft and warm, and his hands were smooth. They moved from Apollo's tunic to the back of his neck, pulling him closer. Apollo felt himself wrap his own hands around Hyacinthus' waist in return, his eyes sliding shut. His mouth was sweet under Apollo's, like long walks under the sun, and flowers in the garden. Even under the dark blanket of the night sky, golden light poured through his body, burning away everything until there was only these few seconds. Hyacinthus pulled away after another moment, resting his forehead against Apollo's. There was a constellation of browns and golds in his irises. \"For the record,\" he breathed, \"I never thought that you were here because of Zephyrus. You don't seem like the type to do something for someone else's needs.\" Apollo felt a very undignified snort escape him, to which Hyacinthus smiled. \"You would probably be right about that.\" Apollo smoothed a thumb over his cheek. \"I'm far too selfish to do such a thing.\" \"I never said you were selfish.\" \"Yes but it was implied.\" Hyacinthus rolled his eyes at Apollo's grin. \"You are insuffera-mmph!\" Apollo cut him off with another kiss, which he quickly melted into. He pulled away as quickly as he came, leaving Hyacinthus dazed. \"Oh, so I'm not selfish, but I'm insufferable?\" \"Apollo!\" Part 4 One month later, Apollo went back home. It was the last thing he wanted to do, but he could tell that he was walking on the edge of his father's temper, and he needed to come back to his duties. Olympus was darker than he remembered. Slate gray towers curved upwards, endlessly, into the clouds. Gold covered roofs sat high above, untouched by the light of the sun. The gardens were beautiful, but almost soulless, contained into perfect rectangles between precisely carved marble floors and columns. Just five months ago, Apollo believed that there was no place more stunning than Olympus. Everything pristine and perfect, glistening in the eye of his childhood. He could go anywhere in the world, and still he chose here. A place fit for the greatest of Gods he used to say. But at some point between first seeing golden brown eyes and staring into them under a starry sky, he changed his mind. It was quiet too, lacking the bustle of servants and royal children, and the distant hum of a city. Gods fluttered in and out, never time for more than a hello, always on the move. It made Apollo dearly miss long walks through unkempt flowers, the feeling of soft mud under his feet, and endless conversations that led everywhere and nowhere at all. Zeus was pleased when he came back, muttering a single phrase when he ambled back into the throne room. \"I'm glad you've remembered your duties.\" Apollo simply bowed his head, walking out before another word could be spoken. It wasn't that he had forgotten them. From the moment he left, he knew he would have to come back home. Truly, he had never thought it would take this long to finally return. He wouldn't stay for long, however. He had promised Hyacinthus, with a kiss to the temple, that he would come back to Sparta as soon as he could. Hyacinthus had simply smiled at him, clutching Apollo's hand where it was placed on his cheek. The memory just made him more restless to leave. For now, though, he was confined to aimlessly wandering the vast halls of Olympus, and trying to find where all the light and music went. Maybe, he thought, it was never there to begin with. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and still everything remained lifeless. He walked to the edge of the mountainside, where pillars gave way to a perfect view. The fading glow of day was giving way to soft violet that would soon turn to inky black. Even the sky no longer held the same beauty as it once did. The bruising purple only led his mind back to a lilac chiton, the bottom covered his bits of dried mud from running through the gardens all day. A rustle of fabric behind him brought Apollo back to himself. He turned on his heel, expecting Artemis or even Hermes, finally with a moment of free time to question where he had been for five long months. Zephryus stood before him, straightening his tunic with deft fingers. Apollo felt his lips turn down at the sight of him. \"Need something?\" he asked, watching Zephrus closely. The God of the West Wind looked displeased, dropping his hands down to his sides. His eyes, the color of ambrosia, narrowed at him in clear distaste. \"You don't deserve him.\" Cutting right to the chase then. Apollo nearly sneered. \"I think he can decide who does and doesn't deserve him.\" His words were spat in low, venomous tones. Zephryus didn't back down. \"He'll see the truth eventually.\" He stepped closer. \"He'll realize that you are nothing more than pomp and arrogance, and that I am the only one for him.\" Apollo laughed, sharp and cruel. \"He will never return your affections, he told me so himself. You are nothing to him. Just a bitter memory.\" Zephryus bit his lip, looking down, and Apollo knew he had struck a nerve. \"You know nothing,\" he said quietly. \"I love him with all my heart, and you have no right to take him away.\" Apollo surveyed him quietly for a moment. \"Unfortunately, it is not enough.\" Zephryus scoffed, petulant, and the next second, he was gone. Apollo thought he should feel very smug that he had managed to make Zephryus run off with his tail between his legs, but all that he felt was longing. He looked around at his home, and longed for wild gardens, long walks, and Sparta. He longed for Hyacinthus. His father could deal with his absence, he decided as he disappeared in a flash of golden light. Sparta was just as bright as he remembered. Now, in the late hours of the evening, the market had fizzled out to just a few people, meandering through stands that stayed open in the hopes of extra business before night fell. The way down to the palace was a short distance, and with every step, Apollo's heart felt lighter and lighter. The unpleasant conversation with Zephryus felt forever away, and soon the castle loomed over him. Apollo didn't bother to make his reappearance known to the King and Queen, instead opting to begin searching the gardens. Every flower seemed extra vibrant, as if welcoming him back home. Apollo felt a grin slip onto his face despite himself. After five minutes of strolling aimlessly, he heard the sound of humming, so familiar to him after all this time. This tune was melancholy and slow, swooping down into depressing minor chords. He followed it, breaking out into a run as he got closer. Finally, he found him, relief and joy finding its way into his chest. Hyacinthus sat in a patch of grass, staring down at his fingers twirling a flower as he hummed absently. Apollo slid to a stop when he saw him, and he looked up suddenly, the melody abruptly being cut off. Silence wrapped around them, as the Prince stared at Apollo, still as a statue. \"Apollo,\" he breathed. \"You're back.\" Apollo inclined his head. \"I'm back.\" A breath, a moment. Then, Hyacinthus jumped to his feet and ran into Apollo's arms. Apollo picked him up easily and twirled him around, as Hyacinthus's gleeful laughter rang bright through the garden. When Apollo stopped moving, Hyacinthus sank down to give him a languid kiss. \"I missed you,\" he mumbled against Apollo's lips. Apollo hummed in response, pulling his lover closer. They stood there, in that garden, for what could have been eternity, just taking in each other after far too long. Eventually, they went inside, where Amyclas told Apollo how pleased he was that he had returned, before the two of them slipped away to Hyacinthus's bedchamber for the night. The next day, they went to the market, walking from stand to stand, sides pressed together as they chatted cheerfully with the shopkeepers who offered their wares in excited tones. Then two days later, they found themselves in the city, walking around and enjoying the buzz of life. A week after that, they left on a trip to the outer farmlands, where they spent several days tucked away in a cozy little inn, staying out late and sleeping in until the sun had reached up high in the sky, stifling heat waking them. Apollo decided during that time that he would leave Sparta again, no matter what his father said. This was the most joy he had felt in his entire life. He should've known it couldn't last forever. One day, they found themselves back in the clearing in the woods where it all started, sunlight pouring generously down onto them. They brought a discus with them, laughing as they tossed it back and forth, grass rustling beneath their feet. Apollo threw it, and Hyacinthus easily caught it in his hand, satisfaction flitting over his face when stone hit his palm. He grinned, walking back across the field to Apollo, and giving him a quick kiss. \"Wonderful job, my love,\" Apollo said, tilting Hyacinthus's chin up towards him. His smile widened, and he batted Apollo's hand away. \"Oh, come now, I only caught it because you've been going easy on me,\" Hyacinthus retorted, pulling away from him abruptly. Apollo pouted, to which Hyacinthus laughed. \"Don't give me that look, you wanted to play today. And I want you to throw it with some of that 'godly strength' you supposedly have.\" \"Hyacinthus,\" Apollo walked back towards him, taking the discus from him. \"If I threw this with my full strength, I would split the very mountains. My father would not be pleased.\" Hyacinthus clasped his hands together, pleading. \"Just a little bit more strength?\" Hyacinthus stared up at him, eyes wide, and Apollo felt his knees go weak. He had never been this enthralled with anyone in his entire godly life. He sighed. \"Okay.\" There had never been another option but to surrender from the start. He winded up, and tossed the discus, employing some of his divine power to make it go twice as far as it normally would. Hyacinthus chased after it, laughing joyfully as he came closer and closer to it, outstretching a hand to make a brilliant catch. Then, something went wrong. The wind, pleasantly rustling the trees, turned on them, blowing in the opposite direction with force enough to knock down a house. In an instant, the discus had whipped around to face Hyacinthus, quickly gaining speed as it shot towards his temple. There was a dull thud and Hyacinthus lost his footing. A scream may have torn its way from Apollo's throat, but he couldn't hear over the blood suddenly rushing through his ears. He was moving before he could think, his feet flying over the grass in a burst of adrenaline, and Hyacinthus landed limply in his arms moments later. He sank down, pulling his lover's head onto his lap. \"It's okay, it's okay, I can fix you,\" he babbled, his hand already sticky with Hyainthus's blood, red and mortal. Distantly, he noticed that the sky had gone dark, but his head was buzzing too much to care. Hyacinthus reached a hand up weakly, stroking away tears that Apollo hadn't realized were there with a thumb. He smiled, eyes hooded. \"It is alright, darling.\" He spoke softly, his voice hoarse and eyes glistening. \"Everything will be alright.\" \"No, no, I can fix this. I have to. I mean,\" Apollo placed his hands to Hyacinthus's chest, drawing up his powers, still mumbling on. \"What's the point of being a god if I can't?\" He tried and tried, but his magic refused to enter Hyacinthus's body. \"No!\" he cried, pushing harder. \"This has to work! Fates be damned, I will save you!\" \"Apollo.\" Hyacinthus moved his chin, forcing him to look him in the eye. \"It's okay. I am mortal, this was bound to happen.\" Apollo stared down at him as realization set in. \"I...I can't save you,\" he whispered, numbness washing over him like a tidal wave. Hyacinthus simply nodded once, still smiling sadly. \"No, you can't.\" His voice was getting softer, and his limp hand dropped down to his chest. \"And that's okay.\" Apollo looked at him for just a moment more, then leaned down, placing a soft kiss against his forehead. \"Goodbye, Prince.\" When he pulled away, the light had left Hyacinthus's eyes. For a moment, he felt nothing. Then, sobs wracked through his body, and he doubled over, laying against the corpse's chest as his shoulders heaved silently. Around them, flowers bloomed, purple and red, all around the clearing. They were bright against the dark, ashen gray sky, the only spot of color in an instant when all light had left the world. In that moment, there was only this: a god and his lost love in a field of flowers, the wind whistling a regretful melody through the trees.",

      "He looked down at Apollo, who was still lounging against the grass, and extended a hand.",
      "\"Come with me, I can show you the way to the dining hall.\"",
      "The dining hall, as it turned out, was less of a hall and more of an outdoor area protected from the sun by a roof supported by several pillars.",
      "There were two long tables parallel to one another, where six royal children already sat.",
      "At the head of each table were the Queen and King.",
      "Amyclas looked up to the sound of padding feet, a smile stealing across his face when he saw the pair.",
      "\"Ah, Hyacinthus, thank you for showing our guest the way.\"",
      "Amyclas turned his attention to Apollo.",
      "\"I hope he wasn't any trouble?\"",
      "It was asked in a light tone but clearly asked another, deeper question beneath it.",
      "He didn't cause any problems, did he?",
      "Hyacinthus looked at him, his eyes filled with fear at his answer, but Apollo just continued to smile sunnily.",
      "\"He was a splendid guide.\"",
      "He waved a hand through the air, as if to brush off the notion, and Hyacinthus relaxed by his side, so subtly that no one else noticed.",
      "They took their places at the end of the table, pulling their plates of meat and bread towards them.",
      "Apollo smiled at him over his plate, and Hyacinthus glanced away, his cheeks filling with an appealing flush.",
      "He believed that he was going to have a nice time here.",
      "Part 2 Apollo stayed for a week, then two.",
      "He explored the entirety of the gardens, strolled around the lavish halls of the palace, and visited the outer-city and the market often.",
      "The family all warmed up to him, waving a hand when he passed them.",
      "All of them, except for one.",
      "Hyacinthus didn't talk to him after that night at dinner.",
      "Whenever he saw him, his cheeks would flare pink, and he would be gone before Apollo could get a single word out.",
      "This frustrated him, of course.",
      "All Apollo wanted to do was just talk to Hyacinthus, that was half the reason he was still here, but it seemed like the Prince himself was intent on making sure that didn't happen.",
      "Why did the fates hate him?",
      "It wasn't until seventeen days, twelve hours, and twenty-two minutes after meeting Hyacinthus the first time-who was counting, though-that Apollo got his first lucky break.",
      "He had woken early to watch the rising of Helios's chariot, dawn touching the sky with her soft pinks and oranges, when he was bumped into by the King and his youngest son.",
      "\"So sorry, sir,\" Amyclas said, patting him on the shoulder.",
      "Hyacinthus averted his eyes, but bowed his head slightly in apology.",
      "Apollo released an easy laugh, bright as golden bells.",
      "The two of them relaxed instinctively.",
      "\"It's quite alright, my good King!",
      "I was just enjoying this beautiful sunrise.",
      "Although, I do wonder what the two of you are doing up so early.\"",
      "His eyes caught on the cloak Hyacinthus was wearing; a traveler's garment.",
      "\"I was just seeing my son off on a journey to the surrounding city.",
      "Some matters that need to be attended to.\"",
      "The King placed a hand on the Prince's shoulder.",
      "Hyacinthus flinched under the weight of it.",
      "Apollo raised a single brow.",
      "\"Really?",
      "I would've expected Argalus to be the one handling matters such as those, considering he is the heir.\"",
      "\"Well normally he would, but he is a bit busy currently with other, more pressing matters.",
      "I thought I might use this as an opportunity to introduce Hyacinthus here to some of the duties of being a prince.",
      "It's not too important that he does it correctly, anyways.\"",
      "That last part was said quietly, but heard nonetheless.",
      "Apollo looked at Hyacinthus, his features etched with embarrassment and shame, and was struck with a sudden idea.",
      "\"Well, I'm no prince, but I do come from a noble family.\"",
      "This, of course, was half a lie, as the Olympians were the highest royalty there was.",
      "\"I could come with him and show him the ropes, perhaps?\"",
      "Hyacinthus looked up suddenly, eyes wide and cheeks rosy.",
      "Amyclas didn't notice, a smile stealing across his face.",
      "\"Why, that's a wonderful idea!\"",
      "He clapped his hands together.",
      "\"As long as you don't mind?\"",
      "Apollo shook his head.",
      "\"Not at all.\"",
      "Hyacinthus didn't speak to him until they were well out of the castle, buildings in sight.",
      "The entire walk over, Apollo could feel the tension radiating off of him.",
      "\"What do you want from me?!\"",
      "Finally, Hyacinthus snapped, stopping in place along the path.",
      "Apollo turned to face him, feigning innocence.",
      "\"Whatever do you mean?\"",
      "Hyacinthus's right eye twitched slightly.",
      "Apollo had to bite back laughter at the reaction.",
      "\"Ever since you came here, you've been following me non-stop.",
      "Constantly three paces behind me in the gardens, or sitting down next to me at dinner, or...this!\"",
      "Hyacinthus huffed, hands thrown up in exasperation.",
      "\"Why don't you just leave me alone already?\"",
      "Apollo smiled serenely, which seemed to make the Prince more annoyed.",
      "He rolled his eyes, then shoved past him.",
      "\"I'm ignoring you.\"",
      "Apollo threw back his head and laughed, causing Hyacinthus to speed up his pace.",
      "\"Wait, no, hold on!\"",
      "Apollo ran after him, grabbing onto the back of his cloak and checking his stride.",
      "\"Prince, wait.",
      "I did not mean to offend.",
      "Will you please talk to me?",
      "I hate a silent walk, it reminds me of the numerous times my sister has been tempted to shoot me with an arrow.\"",
      "A moment of silence, then a snort of laughter.",
      "Apollo brightened with pride; he knew he was hilarious, but he enjoyed having it confirmed.",
      "\"Has she actually threatened that?\"",
      "Hyacinthus asked, amusement still evident in his tone.",
      "He turned back slightly, a sign of surrender.",
      "\"Oh, yes, on numerous occasions.\"",
      "Apollo sighed affectionately, memories of eyes as deep as the night sky glaring at him with rage that could only come from the Goddess of the Hunt herself.",
      "\"She is, frankly, terrifying.\"",
      "\"Hm.\"",
      "Hyacinthus began walking again, slow enough that Apollo could tell he was welcome to stride alongside him, which he did gladly.",
      "\"...What's the rest of your family like?\"",
      "Apollo smiled, pleased for the attention.",
      "\"Oh, where should I even begin?\"",
      "Part 3 After that day, Hyacinthus broke down his walls, little by little.",
      "He stopped avoiding Apollo, and often joined him on his walks in the garden.",
      "What used to be icy stilted silence had thawed away to warm laughter and conversation as flowing as the sweet wine at dinner.",
      "Apollo was sent with him on many diplomatic involvements, and little by little the snide remarks from Amyclas were reduced, giving way to occasional praise.",
      "Every time it happened, Hyacinthus turned towards him, his face happily flushed, causing Apollo's nonexistent heart to stutter.",
      "Hyacinthus became more comfortable with him physically, as well.",
      "Often, he would place a hand on Apollo's knee while they sat out in the gardens, or a soft hug when they woke and before they went to bed.",
      "Once, after an afternoon in the market, there was a soft press of lips to his cheek as they came up on the palace.",
      "The next second, Hyacinthus had slipped away, Apollo still stood in dazed confusion in front of the gates.",
      "It had been nearly three months.",
      "Apollo could feel it in the air, that Zeus was getting annoyed with his absence.",
      "He wouldn't be surprised if Hermes was sent looking for him soon, or at the very least Iris.",
      "It didn't matter though; he didn't want to leave yet.",
      "He wouldn't leave yet, not when there was still so much to learn about Hyacinthus.",
      "A storm rolled in, a sign of his father's bad temper.",
      "It was gone within a night, but the pounding of the rain and the crack of thunder was enough evidence that its length did not reflect its severity.",
      "The morning after, Apollo and Hyacinthus trailed after the servants who worked in the garden, helping tend to the water-tread flowers that had sunk into the supple mud.",
      "Just Apollo's divine nature was enough for them to recover quickly, basking in his glow.",
      "Amyclas ran into them that night, looking terribly frazzled.",
      "He paced up and down the hallway, muttering wildly, and barely spared the two of them a glance when they entered.",
      "\"Father, calm down, what's wrong?\"",
      "Hyacinthus walked up to him and placed a steadying hand on his forearm.",
      "The King seemed to melt under the weight of it.",
      "\"A messenger came in from one of the surrounding farm towns a few minutes ago.",
      "All the crops have been flooded.\"",
      "He raked a hand through his graying hair.",
      "\"I don't know what to do.",
      "Aragalus is away, the rest of your brothers are terribly busy with their studies, and I'm too old to make a journey that far.",
      "But if I don't send someone, then this will never be sorted out, and food won't make it out to the city...\"",
      "Amyclas trailed off, looking exceedingly more worried.",
      "Hyacinthus considered this information, tapping a finger to his cheek.",
      "\"...You could send me.\"",
      "Amyclas scrunched his nose at him, a knee-jerk reaction that he schooled off his face.",
      "\"My dear son, I know you have been doing rather well recently, but this matter is really rather delicate, and you are still not the best at negotiations.\"",
      "Hyacinthus huffed at the King's claim, crossing his arms.",
      "Apollo placed a soothing hand on his shoulder.",
      "\"I would go with him, if it makes you feel any better,\" he said.",
      "Amyclas looked up at him.",
      "\"Seeing as you don't really have any better options, I would like to be of some assistance.\"",
      "Amclas nodded slightly, placing a hand to his mouth as his muttering started again, much less frantic this time.",
      "\"Yes...I believe that could work out well.",
      "If you're there, then you can, yes...\"",
      "He smiled up at Apollo.",
      "\"This is wonderful!",
      "Thank you for your help, uh, hmm...\"",
      "The King paused, a puzzled expression on his face.",
      "\"...You know, I don't believe I ever caught your name, after all this time.\"",
      "Apollo smirked at him, bright and reassuring.",
      "Amyclas blinked against the radiance that he was off putting, his face turning relaxed and his eyes glazing over.",
      "\"I never offered it,\" Apollo responded.",
      "Amyclas nodded in a dazed fashion.",
      "\"I-yes, that seems perfectly reasonable-I do believe I may have overstepped-well, I mean I...I seem to have forgotten what we were talking about.\"",
      "Amyclas scratched his head thoughtfully.",
      "Apollo laughed.",
      "\"Oh, don't worry about that now.",
      "It is getting late, however, and we need to be off in the morning.",
      "You should go get some rest.\"",
      "He bowed to Amyclas, who nodded, a little bit hesitantly, and began walking off towards his chambers.",
      "Apollo gently pushed the space between Hyacinthus's shoulder blades, where his hand still lay.",
      "\"Come along, Prince, let me walk you to your room.\"",
      "Hyacinthus looked at him with an odd expression.",
      "\"...Okay...\"",
      "Hyacinthus said, a little questioning.",
      "Apollo brushed off the strangeness.",
      "He was probably just a little tired.",
      "The next morning, the three of them met in the courtyard.",
      "Amyclas fiddled anxiously, repeating the same instructions multiple times in a row, or checking their rations even though he had already checked twice.",
      "Apollo stroked the side of his horse's head, gently.",
      "\"Father.\"",
      "Hyacinthus caught the King's hand from where it shuffled through their bags for what had to be the fifth time.",
      "\"It will be alright.",
      "With the two of us there, what could go wrong?\"",
      "Amyclas bit his lip.",
      "\"Well, I just need to make sure that you, I mean, both of you are very competent, but...\"",
      "Amyclas trailed off, to which Hyacinthus sighed.",
      "\"Please, just put a little faith in me?",
      "Just this once?\"",
      "Hyacinthus begged.",
      "Amyclas stared at his son, eyebrows furrowed, before slowly nodding.",
      "\"I...yes, I can do that.\"",
      "He pulled his hand away, and turned to Apollo.",
      "\"You will make sure that things run smoothly?\"",
      "\"Do not fret, King.",
      "I will make it my highest priority.\"",
      "Apollo smiled at him.",
      "Amyclas nodded again, then glanced between the two.",
      "\"Okay, yes.",
      "Well, have a good journey, please come home by tomorrow evening.\"",
      "Amyclas let out a breath, then turned towards the doors.",
      "Hyacinthus bowed his head.",
      "\"...Good bye, my son.\"",
      "The next moment, he was gone.",
      "Hyacinthus heaved a heavy sigh, his shoulders drooping.",
      "He looked up at Apollo and smiled, exhaustion etched into the creases of his eyes.",
      "\"Come along, companion.",
      "It is time to begin the journey,\" Hyacinthus said, slinging his bag over his shoulder and pulling himself onto his horse's back.",
      "Apollo followed suit, and soon the two of them were on the way, easy conversation flowing between the sound of hoofs hitting well packed dirt.",
      "Somewhere on the outskirts of the city, Hyacinthus fell silent.",
      "Apollo could sense heavy tension strung through the air.",
      "He fumbled for a way to cut it.",
      "\"Um...\" Hyacinthus turned towards him, eyes flashing in the morning light.",
      "He looked almost ethereal.",
      "\"I've been wondering about why you and your father are so...?\"",
      "Apollo winced.",
      "Clearly, spending time around mortals had made him lose some of his tact.",
      "Hyacinthus turned away from him, eyes hooded.",
      "\"You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I just thought-\" \"It's alright,\" the Prince cut in.",
      "\"I'll tell you.\"",
      "He looked up at the sky where the morning light turned from golden to sweet yellow as the day wore on.",
      "\"A few years ago, my father presented me with a potential spouse.",
      "He was exuberant that his youngest son was engaged.",
      "It was my job to court her, as her father had not yet decided who she would marry.",
      "I tried as hard as I could to charm her, and I think that it would've worked out,",
      "if...\" Hyacinthus hunched his shoulders in shame.",
      "\"If I hadn't messed everything up.\"",
      "He said this last part very quietly, like he didn't want Apollo to hear.",
      "However, he heard nonetheless, his stomach twisting from the sheer pain in Hyacinthus's voice.",
      "\"Messed everything up?",
      "How?\"",
      "Hyacinthus huffed, clenching his fists.",
      "\"I wasn't interested in her, but I figured that it was better to go along with my father's whims.",
      "However, the night that I was supposed to ask for her father's hand in marriage, I began to feel guilty.",
      "She was always so happy to see me, and I could not return the feeling.",
      "I thought she might understand, so I told her my woes, hoping she would still marry me even if I did not love her.\"",
      "He bit his lip.",
      "\"I still remember her running off, crying.\"",
      "Apollo watched him, a crease in between his brows.",
      "\"So...then what happened?\"",
      "\"I was so ashamed that I went home without even talking to the King.",
      "My father was furious with me.",
      "He wouldn't talk to me for months.",
      "I might've even been thrown out if it hadn't been for my mother.",
      "And now...\" Hyacinthus broke off with a sigh.",
      "\"Well, I think you get the idea.\"",
      "Apollo turned away from him, considering.",
      "\"...Once my father actually did throw me out.\"",
      "Hyacinthus turned to him in shock.",
      "\"Really?",
      "You?\"",
      "Apollo laughed at that.",
      "\"Yes, me.",
      "He was furious with me, and he sent me to live with some farmers for a few months until he deemed it appropriate for me to return.\"",
      "He smiled fondly at the memory.",
      "\"An overreaction, if you ask me, but he seemed to think it was necessary.\"",
      "Apollo felt a measure of pride rush through him when a small grin stole across Hyacinthus's face.",
      "\"I just didn't really expect you to be the type who gets in trouble.",
      "You just seem so...good.\"",
      "Apollo giggled, considering how untrue that statement was.",
      "\"You would be surprised.\"",
      "He sighed, a lazy smile spreading across his face.",
      "\"Although, he never tried to get me to marry.\"",
      "\"Oh.\"",
      "Hyacitnhus stroked his fingers mindlessly over the hair of his horse's neck mindlessly.",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"It was never very important to him,\" he responded.",
      "\"Although, that doesn't mean I haven't pursued romance.\"",
      "Apollo let out a breezy laugh.",
      "Hyacinthus was silent for several moments, and when Apollo looked over, he almost looked embarrassed.",
      "\"What about you?\"",
      "Apollo saw Hyacinthus flinch at the question.",
      "\"What about me?\"",
      "\"Well, I know there was that Princess, but have you ever pursued romance, just for, you know, yourself?\"",
      "Hyacinthus began to shake his head, and then stopped, face considering.",
      "\"...Kind of?\"",
      "Apollo smirked at him.",
      "\"What's that supposed to mean?\"",
      "\"Well...\"",
      "He raked a hand through his hair.",
      "\"There was an event, but...it's not what you're talking about.\"",
      "Apollo raised an eyebrow.",
      "\"Elaborate?\"",
      "Hyacinthus glanced up at him, licking his bottom lip.",
      "\"...You're not the first person who visited the palace recently.",
      "Last summer, there was another nobleman, who I ended up becoming quite close to.\"",
      "Apollo felt his eyes widen, his stomach twisting just barely.",
      "\"Really?\"",
      "Hyacinthus nodded.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "I loved his company; I thought of him as my closest friend and I thought he felt similar, but one day he...\"",
      "Hyacinthus paused, swallowing, and then abruptly switching topics.",
      "\"At some point, he told me he was a god.",
      "Zephyrus, the West Wind.\"",
      "Apollo tried to suppress the scowl threatening to take over his face.",
      "\"I accepted it quickly.",
      "It didn't make him a different person, was what I thought.",
      "But then...\" This time, when he paused, he didn't start again.",
      "\"Then?\"",
      "Apollo prompted.",
      "\"He told me was in love with me,\" he said this quietly, as if he couldn't bear to admit it.",
      "\"And when I couldn't return his feelings, he...\"",
      "Hyacinthus sucked in a breath.",
      "\"He was angry.",
      "He told me that I was being selfish, and that I would never find anyone like him, because he was divine.\"",
      "His fists had curled into fists, knuckles white.",
      "\"Finally, he left, but he told me that when I came to my senses, I could call upon him.",
      "I spent the rest of that summer locked away in my room, I couldn't stand to face anyone.\"",
      "\"Oh, Hyacinthus,\" Apollo sighed, wishing he could reach out and embrace him.",
      "\"It was not your fault, you know.\"",
      "Hyacinthus gave a slight nod.",
      "\"Of course he would be like this,\" Apollo mumbled, hoping it wouldn't be heard.",
      "To no avail.",
      "\"What do you mean, 'he would be like this'?\"",
      "Hyacinthus narrowed his eyes at him.",
      "Apollo fumbled for a plausible explanation.",
      "\"Oh, well, that's just what I've heard.",
      "You know, how people talk about the Gods.\"",
      "Hyacinthus furrowed his brows.",
      "\"...Right.\"",
      "The air between them hung heavy and quiet for a moment, suspicion apparent in Hyacinthus' face.",
      "Apollo felt discomfort creep through him, spreading over every inch of his body.",
      "\"Anyways, how about we talk about something more pleasant?\" he finally said, if only to fill the itching silence.",
      "Hyacinthus narrowed his eyes.",
      "\"How-how far are we from our destination?\"",
      "The heavy gaze was finally broken, the Prince looking out to the horizon.",
      "\"Still at least half a day's journey.",
      "We'll need to stop to eat soon.\"",
      "\"Oh, can we stop soon?",
      "I'm starving!\"",
      "Apollo dramatically flung a hand to his forehead.",
      "An incredulous laugh left Hyacinthus' mouth.",
      "\"We had breakfast an hour ago!\"",
      "Apollo grinned at him.",
      "Hyacinthus rolled his eyes, and the previous conversation was forgotten.",
      "They reached the nearest village hours later, when the sun began to sink below the horizon.",
      "The two were led to a small set of dingy stables on the edge of the town where they kept their horses.",
      "Hyacinthus grinned at Apollo as they walked out, heading to the first plot of land that was affected.",
      "They did that for the rest of the evening, going around town and asking the farmers what supplies they would need to get their growth back on track after the storm.",
      "When they were finished, they took a stroll around, chatting amicably about nothing at all.",
      "Apollo led them away from the actual community at some point, and into the thick forest to the west of the village.",
      "\"My mother used to take me and my siblings here all the time,\" Hyacinthus said as they weaved through trees.",
      "The last of the sun's honey glow had faded, leaving nothing but the moon's silver light peeking through the leaves.",
      "\"I don't remember why, but when we had the time, we would take trips out here and stay in the forest for a day.",
      "Back when I was still small enough to ride on the back of a cart.\"",
      "Apollo considered this.",
      "\"My father never took me anywhere.",
      "I went where I pleased, sometimes with my sister, sometimes with one of my half brothers.",
      "My family was never close enough to all go anywhere together.\"",
      "\"What about your mother?\"",
      "Hyacinthus looked up at him through thick lashes.",
      "\"I was not allowed to see my birth mother often, and my step-mother, well...\"",
      "Apollo trailed off, thinking of Hera's cold sneer whenever she saw him.",
      "\"She was not exactly fond of me, being one of her husband's bastard children.\"",
      "\"Oh.\"",
      "Hyacinthus was reduced to silence by that, eyes contemplative.",
      "\"It's alright, though,\" Apollo intercepted.",
      "\"I still have my siblings.",
      "And besides, if I was not able to go where I pleased, I would never have met you.\"",
      "Hyacinthus smiled at him, but he seemed quiet for the rest of the walk.",
      "Little over five minutes later, the trees parted, giving way to clearing where the canopy broke.",
      "The moonlight shining down on the grass made it almost look blue.",
      "\"Beautiful,\" Apollo breathed, stepping into the ring of trees.",
      "\"The perfect place to practice archery, or play discus.\"",
      "He tapped a finger to his lips.",
      "\"Hyacinthus, do you think we could-\"",
      "He turned on his foot, a smile on his face, but it faded when he saw Hyacinthus's expression.",
      "It was tight and confused, and a little bit hurt.",
      "Apollo walked closer to him gingerly.",
      "\"Hyacinthus, what is wrong?\"",
      "Hyacinthus looked at him, eyes searching.",
      "Evidently, he didn't find what he wanted, because he looked back down at the ground, a sigh on his lips.",
      "\"Hyacinthus?\"",
      "\"I think I know what you are.\"",
      "The statement was sudden, seemingly out of nowhere.",
      "Apollo nearly took a step back at the conviction that overtook his features.",
      "He swallowed.",
      "\"Really?\" he asked.",
      "Hyacinthus nodded.",
      "\"Whatever do you mean?\"",
      "\"I mean...\"",
      "Hyacinthus pulled at his hair, pacing.",
      "\"There are all these things about you.",
      "Like how you've never told anyone your name, despite being here for so long, or the stories you tell about your family, or the way...\"",
      "Hyacinthus trailed off clearly embarrassed.",
      "\"...The way you look, and how everyone treats you.",
      "Sometimes, it seems like you change everyone's mood with a smile.",
      "And when we discussed Zephyrus, you almost acted like you've met him.\"",
      "Apollo's shoulders were drawn up to his ears, nerves flaring.",
      "\"...So, what do you think I am?\"",
      "he finally mustered up the courage to ask.",
      "Hyacinthus clenched his eyes shut for just a second, and then looked up, surety in every inch of his features.",
      "\"You're a god, aren't you?\"",
      "Time simultaneously seemed to stop and speed up all at once, an eternity wrapped in what could only be a few seconds.",
      "The wind quit whistling, and the trees stopped swaying.",
      "In that instant, the world was quiet, listening.",
      "Apollo finally broke the silence after another moment with a sigh.",
      "\"...It would be easy to deny, but it is true.",
      "I am a god, the God Apollo.\"",
      "He clenched his fists as he said it, looking to the ground in shame.",
      "Hyacinthus nodded, resigned, then kept nodding, bracing himself against a tree.",
      "Apollo could see in the faint silver moonlight that his eyes had become glassy.",
      "He nearly took a step forward, to try to comfort, but thought better of it.",
      "\"Listen, Hyacinthus, I didn't mean to...",
      "I mean, I didn't know about what Zephryus...you have to understand-\" Apollo stopped when he heard a watery chuckle, then another.",
      "He stared at Hyacinthus in shock as he dissolved into nearly hysterical laughter.",
      "\"Hyacinthus?\"",
      "\"Gods, just shut up,\" Hyacinthus cut in, gulping for air.",
      "There were still traces of amusement in his tone.",
      "\"You -you are just such an idiot.",
      "I can't even believe it, you are so stupid.\"",
      "In one quick movement, he pulled himself away from the bark of the tree he was leaning on, striding over to Apollo.",
      "\"What are you-\"",
      "Hyacinthus grabbed the front of his chiton, pulling him down.",
      "His lips were soft and warm, and his hands were smooth.",
      "They moved from Apollo's tunic to the back of his neck, pulling him closer.",
      "Apollo felt himself wrap his own hands around Hyacinthus' waist in return, his eyes sliding shut.",
      "His mouth was sweet under Apollo's, like long walks under the sun, and flowers in the garden.",
      "Even under the dark blanket of the night sky, golden light poured through his body, burning away everything until there was only these few seconds.",
      "Hyacinthus pulled away after another moment, resting his forehead against Apollo's.",
      "There was a constellation of browns and golds in his irises.",
      "\"For the record,\" he breathed, \"I never thought that you were here because of Zephyrus.",
      "You don't seem like the type to do something for someone else's needs.\"",
      "Apollo felt a very undignified snort escape him, to which Hyacinthus smiled.",
      "\"You would probably be right about that.\"",
      "Apollo smoothed a thumb over his cheek.",
      "\"I'm far too selfish to do such a thing.\"",
      "\"I never said you were selfish.\"",
      "\"Yes but it was implied.\"",
      "Hyacinthus rolled his eyes at Apollo's grin.",
      "\"You are insuffera-mmph!\"",
      "Apollo cut him off with another kiss, which he quickly melted into.",
      "He pulled away as quickly as he came, leaving Hyacinthus dazed.",
      "\"Oh, so I'm not selfish, but I'm insufferable?\"",
      "\"Apollo!\"",
      "Part 4 One month later, Apollo went back home.",
      "It was the last thing he wanted to do, but he could tell that he was walking on the edge of his father's temper, and he needed to come back to his duties.",
      "Olympus was darker than he remembered.",
      "Slate gray towers curved upwards, endlessly, into the clouds.",
      "Gold covered roofs sat high above, untouched by the light of the sun.",
      "The gardens were beautiful, but almost soulless, contained into perfect rectangles between precisely carved marble floors and columns.",
      "Just five months ago, Apollo believed that there was no place more stunning than Olympus.",
      "Everything pristine and perfect, glistening in the eye of his childhood.",
      "He could go anywhere in the world, and still he chose here.",
      "A place fit for the greatest of Gods he used to say.",
      "But at some point between first seeing golden brown eyes and staring into them under a starry sky, he changed his mind.",
      "It was quiet too, lacking the bustle of servants and royal children, and the distant hum of a city.",
      "Gods fluttered in and out, never time for more than a hello, always on the move.",
      "It made Apollo dearly miss long walks through unkempt flowers, the feeling of soft mud under his feet, and endless conversations that led everywhere and nowhere at all.",
      "Zeus was pleased when he came back, muttering a single phrase when he ambled back into the throne room.",
      "\"I'm glad you've remembered your duties.\"",
      "Apollo simply bowed his head, walking out before another word could be spoken.",
      "It wasn't that he had forgotten them.",
      "From the moment he left, he knew he would have to come back home.",
      "Truly, he had never thought it would take this long to finally return.",
      "He wouldn't stay for long, however.",
      "He had promised Hyacinthus, with a kiss to the temple, that he would come back to Sparta as soon as he could.",
      "Hyacinthus had simply smiled at him, clutching Apollo's hand where it was placed on his cheek.",
      "The memory just made him more restless to leave.",
      "For now, though, he was confined to aimlessly wandering the vast halls of Olympus, and trying to find where all the light and music went.",
      "Maybe, he thought, it was never there to begin with.",
      "Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and still everything remained lifeless.",
      "He walked to the edge of the mountainside, where pillars gave way to a perfect view.",
      "The fading glow of day was giving way to soft violet that would soon turn to inky black.",
      "Even the sky no longer held the same beauty as it once did.",
      "The bruising purple only led his mind back to a lilac chiton, the bottom covered his bits of dried mud from running through the gardens all day.",
      "A rustle of fabric behind him brought Apollo back to himself.",
      "He turned on his heel, expecting Artemis or even Hermes, finally with a moment of free time to question where he had been for five long months.",
      "Zephryus stood before him, straightening his tunic with deft fingers.",
      "Apollo felt his lips turn down at the sight of him.",
      "\"Need something?\"",
      "he asked, watching Zephrus closely.",
      "The God of the West Wind looked displeased, dropping his hands down to his sides.",
      "His eyes, the color of ambrosia, narrowed at him in clear distaste.",
      "\"You don't deserve him.\"",
      "Cutting right to the chase then.",
      "Apollo nearly sneered.",
      "\"I think he can decide who does and doesn't deserve him.\"",
      "His words were spat in low, venomous tones.",
      "Zephryus didn't back down.",
      "\"He'll see the truth eventually.\"",
      "He stepped closer.",
      "\"He'll realize that you are nothing more than pomp and arrogance, and that I am the only one for him.\"",
      "Apollo laughed, sharp and cruel.",
      "\"He will never return your affections, he told me so himself.",
      "You are nothing to him.",
      "Just a bitter memory.\"",
      "Zephryus bit his lip, looking down, and Apollo knew he had struck a nerve.",
      "\"You know nothing,\" he said quietly.",
      "\"I love him with all my heart, and you have no right to take him away.\"",
      "Apollo surveyed him quietly for a moment.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it is not enough.\"",
      "Zephryus scoffed, petulant, and the next second, he was gone.",
      "Apollo thought he should feel very smug that he had managed to make Zephryus run off with his tail between his legs, but all that he felt was longing.",
      "He looked around at his home, and longed for wild gardens, long walks, and Sparta.",
      "He longed for Hyacinthus.",
      "His father could deal with his absence, he decided as he disappeared in a flash of golden light.",
      "Sparta was just as bright as he remembered.",
      "Now, in the late hours of the evening, the market had fizzled out to just a few people, meandering through stands that stayed open in the hopes of extra business before night fell.",
      "The way down to the palace was a short distance, and with every step, Apollo's heart felt lighter and lighter.",
      "The unpleasant conversation with Zephryus felt forever away, and soon the castle loomed over him.",
      "Apollo didn't bother to make his reappearance known to the King and Queen, instead opting to begin searching the gardens.",
      "Every flower seemed extra vibrant, as if welcoming him back home.",
      "Apollo felt a grin slip onto his face despite himself.",
      "After five minutes of strolling aimlessly, he heard the sound of humming, so familiar to him after all this time.",
      "This tune was melancholy and slow, swooping down into depressing minor chords.",
      "He followed it, breaking out into a run as he got closer.",
      "Finally, he found him, relief and joy finding its way into his chest.",
      "Hyacinthus sat in a patch of grass, staring down at his fingers twirling a flower as he hummed absently.",
      "Apollo slid to a stop when he saw him, and he looked up suddenly, the melody abruptly being cut off.",
      "Silence wrapped around them, as the Prince stared at Apollo, still as a statue.",
      "\"Apollo,\" he breathed.",
      "\"You're back.\"",
      "Apollo inclined his head.",
      "\"I'm back.\"",
      "A breath, a moment.",
      "Then, Hyacinthus jumped to his feet and ran into Apollo's arms.",
      "Apollo picked him up easily and twirled him around, as Hyacinthus's gleeful laughter rang bright through the garden.",
      "When Apollo stopped moving, Hyacinthus sank down to give him a languid kiss.",
      "\"I missed you,\" he mumbled against Apollo's lips.",
      "Apollo hummed in response, pulling his lover closer.",
      "They stood there, in that garden, for what could have been eternity, just taking in each other after far too long.",
      "Eventually, they went inside, where Amyclas told Apollo how pleased he was that he had returned, before the two of them slipped away to Hyacinthus's bedchamber for the night.",
      "The next day, they went to the market, walking from stand to stand, sides pressed together as they chatted cheerfully with the shopkeepers who offered their wares in excited tones.",
      "Then two days later, they found themselves in the city, walking around and enjoying the buzz of life.",
      "A week after that, they left on a trip to the outer farmlands, where they spent several days tucked away in a cozy little inn, staying out late and sleeping in until the sun had reached up high in the sky, stifling heat waking them.",
      "Apollo decided during that time that he would leave Sparta again, no matter what his father said.",
      "This was the most joy he had felt in his entire life.",
      "He should've known it couldn't last forever.",
      "One day, they found themselves back in the clearing in the woods where it all started, sunlight pouring generously down onto them.",
      "They brought a discus with them, laughing as they tossed it back and forth, grass rustling beneath their feet.",
      "Apollo threw it, and Hyacinthus easily caught it in his hand, satisfaction flitting over his face when stone hit his palm.",
      "He grinned, walking back across the field to Apollo, and giving him a quick kiss.",
      "\"Wonderful job, my love,\" Apollo said, tilting Hyacinthus's chin up towards him.",
      "His smile widened, and he batted Apollo's hand away.",
      "\"Oh, come now, I only caught it because you've been going easy on me,\" Hyacinthus retorted, pulling away from him abruptly.",
      "Apollo pouted, to which Hyacinthus laughed.",
      "\"Don't give me that look, you wanted to play today.",
      "And I want you to throw it with some of that 'godly strength' you supposedly have.\"",
      "\"Hyacinthus,\" Apollo walked back towards him, taking the discus from him.",
      "\"If I threw this with my full strength, I would split the very mountains.",
      "My father would not be pleased.\"",
      "Hyacinthus clasped his hands together, pleading.",
      "\"Just a little bit more strength?\"",
      "Hyacinthus stared up at him, eyes wide, and Apollo felt his knees go weak.",
      "He had never been this enthralled with anyone in his entire godly life.",
      "He sighed.",
      "\"Okay.\"",
      "There had never been another option but to surrender from the start.",
      "He winded up, and tossed the discus, employing some of his divine power to make it go twice as far as it normally would.",
      "Hyacinthus chased after it, laughing joyfully as he came closer and closer to it, outstretching a hand to make a brilliant catch.",
      "Then, something went wrong.",
      "The wind, pleasantly rustling the trees, turned on them, blowing in the opposite direction with force enough to knock down a house.",
      "In an instant, the discus had whipped around to face Hyacinthus, quickly gaining speed as it shot towards his temple.",
      "There was a dull thud and Hyacinthus lost his footing.",
      "A scream may have torn its way from Apollo's throat, but he couldn't hear over the blood suddenly rushing through his ears.",
      "He was moving before he could think, his feet flying over the grass in a burst of adrenaline, and Hyacinthus landed limply in his arms moments later.",
      "He sank down, pulling his lover's head onto his lap.",
      "\"It's okay, it's okay, I can fix you,\" he babbled, his hand already sticky with Hyainthus's blood, red and mortal.",
      "Distantly, he noticed that the sky had gone dark, but his head was buzzing too much to care.",
      "Hyacinthus reached a hand up weakly, stroking away tears that Apollo hadn't realized were there with a thumb.",
      "He smiled, eyes hooded.",
      "\"It is alright, darling.\"",
      "He spoke softly, his voice hoarse and eyes glistening.",
      "\"Everything will be alright.\"",
      "\"No, no, I can fix this.",
      "I have to.",
      "I mean,\" Apollo placed his hands to Hyacinthus's chest, drawing up his powers, still mumbling on.",
      "\"What's the point of being a god if I can't?\"",
      "He tried and tried, but his magic refused to enter Hyacinthus's body.",
      "\"No!\" he cried, pushing harder.",
      "\"This has to work!",
      "Fates be damned, I will save you!\"",
      "\"Apollo.\"",
      "Hyacinthus moved his chin, forcing him to look him in the eye.",
      "\"It's okay.",
      "I am mortal, this was bound to happen.\"",
      "Apollo stared down at him as realization set in.",
      "\"I...I can't save you,\" he whispered, numbness washing over him like a tidal wave.",
      "Hyacinthus simply nodded once, still smiling sadly.",
      "\"No, you can't.\"",
      "His voice was getting softer, and his limp hand dropped down to his chest.",
      "\"And that's okay.\"",
      "Apollo looked at him for just a moment more, then leaned down, placing a soft kiss against his forehead.",
      "\"Goodbye, Prince.\"",
      "When he pulled away, the light had left Hyacinthus's eyes.",
      "For a moment, he felt nothing.",
      "Then, sobs wracked through his body, and he doubled over, laying against the corpse's chest as his shoulders heaved silently.",
      "Around them, flowers bloomed, purple and red, all around the clearing.",
      "They were bright against the dark, ashen gray sky, the only spot of color in an instant when all light had left the world.",
      "In that moment, there was only this: a god and his lost love in a field of flowers, the wind whistling a regretful melody through the trees."

    "text": "He embraced my touch, his cloak hugging my uncovered flesh, his intense cold gaze inspecting my body meticulously, as to make sure I was alright. I wasn't. An anger frown curved his eyebrows as he analyzed my state: half naked, with only a loose violet bra, a hip belt, and a curt coined scarf around my waist. A lowly dancer's clothing. Wrath crowned his being. Rage was effortlessly readable in his eyes. He didn't like what he was seeing. I didn't either. I averted my eyes in abash, gazing down at my clutching fingers, ashamed about the situation he found me in, the position his men put me in. A mere war-distraction. A pure toy of pleasure. I blacked my sight away, not daring to reclaim it, praying to escape this opprobrious state. To disappear. I felt like a burden, a disappointment of his. And it hurts. The air inside his cover was thick, grasping, dominating. Forcing his claim on me. It was warm, incredibly fiery. But his embrace was more blazing, much, and much and much feistier than the tied cloth. To the point where my heart's resting pieces jumbled and reformed, giving life to my already buried soul. Giving me life. Only to burn it again and turn it into ashes. Again and again, and again another time. Dooming my being. Till no ashes were left. Just a hard, devastating, enchanting fire longing in my chest. His mere presence was consuming my mortality, and I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the strange comfort his body gave mine, the comfort of being helpless while being devoured. At his mercy. Sinking in reverie. A mythical one. Until the reminiscence of his icy eyes made me remember his disappointment. It hurts. Its hurts, like a cool freezing ocean wave, extinguishing the fire spreading in my chest. My insides were cold. And it hurts. My eyelids were still closed. I choked as I distastefully cursed myself, my sinful self. I shivered, a hot liquid pouring on my tangled fingers: Drop after drop, and another drop again. Again and again, and again another time. Was it rain? No, rain wasn't this warm. Warm. I unveiled my vision at my now moist gripped hands. Its fingers, its fingers painted with a red, dark red, perhaps firebrick, tint. Drawing each scratch, each scar, each wrinkle of my scarred palms. As a painter's ink would to his painting. The ink being firebrick heated blood, the painter my Lord's veins. Diomedes' veins. And the painting, well, the painting was my soaked hands. The drops kept on falling, one after another. Again and again, and again another time. Following the slow rhythm of my moving head, falling as it climbed the air, staring at the ink's origin. My Lord's temple. Diomedes' temple. The firebrick kept on raining on my scars, until I finished my climbing. Head up, high as I could, but still underneath him. I faced his intense clear eyes. Goldenrod Bright yellowish petals illuminating his orbs. Grand, Majestic, yet homely. He had the earth's tint, the mud's scent, the forest beauty, the familiar sense of a shelter, of a home, my home. Everywhere he was, seemed right to me. Goldenrod Bright yellowish sense of a beloved feeling. A faraway sentiment that was forgotten, but still alive, somewhere in my mind, in my spirit, my soul, my heart, my ashes, my fire. His irises were wording me. Enchanting Goldenrod irises reassuring me, telling me that I was fine where I was: in his arms. I was secure, protected. It felt right, dangerously well, devastatingly good, madly pleasing. Like a swift feeling of enjoyment that destroyed my Troy's walls, welcoming him in my unprotected heart's palace. Ashes. Fire. I scanned his eyes, then the glimpse of disappointment in his infuriating orbs. He was disappointed. I couldn't help but gulp in fear, my throat sore, my stomach churning. The coined scarf shook lightly. Was it by fear or desire? I didn't know. I couldn't know. And it hurts. I wanted him to adore me, to venerate me, to admire my body as those lustful men do. My womanhood yearned for validation, his validation. Looks of adoration and awe, not apathy and distaste. I shivered as I felt the blood pouring in my chin, my Lord's blood. Slowly sliding my neck, reaching my bosom, to pose between my breasts, in the middle of my chest. Right where my burned ashes left his heated warmth, his torrid embrace's fire, his fire, his. - My lord, you're bleeding. I whispered as his cadenced breath collided with my freezing nose. His eyes narrowed, went from my face to where his ink's last drop hid. My searing spot. - And you're shivering. His rough, resounding voice declared, muscles tightening the cloak's grip around my shape. Gently, he lifted my legs, arms snacking my waist and thighs, carrying me to his tent. - I'll get you warmed. He murmured. It was a just sentence, a mere statement, but with his voice, so firm, so resolute, I couldn't help but timidly swallow my fear. It was a mere sentence, yet it felt like an inescapable punishment. I'm already burning, my Lord. ***** My Lord. I stammered, admiring his voluptuous mass setting the fire, stronging it, harding it, broiling the thin wooden sticks till their ashes proliferated in the tent's caged air, thick gray smoke covered his bare back, clothing his exposed flesh, its shadow sharpening each chunk of him. Robust sturdy muscles contracting firmly with each move he made, with each dance his strong arms performed. Thick veins, bustling, twitching, showing their gift by their august ploy. Hard brown skin, scratched, scarred, bruised by the memories of the hardships he's been through: Battles he has lost. Wars he has won. Lands he has taken. Kingdoms he has conquered. Scars. Old as new, big as small. Each defined him better than no one. Each held a story no one knew but himself, proving every prowess he has achieved. Each scab carved his spirit, each scab shaded his spirit, all these scabs birthed his spirit, made him who he is: Son of Tydeus, Favored by Athena. A warrior, a hero, a butcher, a king, a lord, my lord, my jailor, my. Ashes.Fire. The air was getting thicker and thicker under the growing vapor, the broad cloak sticking to my body like a second skin. His presence was gripping my chest and my desire was burning my core. Checking the wide lasting pyre and the warmness of the suffocating place, he stood, turning around, veins and scars dancing together. bruises. He shifted to the left wing of the tent, where the towering steel column royally holded the lavish curtains of the room. Then his eyes met mine. Petals piercing leaves. Goldenrod piercing green. His irises ordered mine as he sat on the woolen couch I made. Wash me. He said. I downed my gaze, freeing my shape from his cloak's grip, folding it gently before putting it on the thick threads of the rug beneath. I made that one too, I noticed. I stood, I moved, my slow steps closing the distance between us, then I stopped, I sat, my shivering hands wetting a cloth, my unsteady moves scrubbing his torso, his arms, his abdomen, his palms, his back, all strong, all sinewy, all power. I cleaned his defined anatomy. Eyes down, green down, leaves down, submitting to his imperious will. As I should. A long sigh escaped him as I scrubbed his scarred muscles, accentuating my hold to purge the dried blood off his skin. Wiping the dirt off. Wipe after wipe, and another wipe again, again and again, and again another time. All his nerves' knots opened as I pressed the sore areas of his body, and he immediately relaxed, humming a pleasing war lullaby. He liked it, I noted. I liked it too, I noted too. His warmth was spreading all over the cloth, all over my hands, warming my jittery organs, like a heat wave, a contagious fever taking both of us. An illness, a delicious illness devouring my being as a whole. He was poisoning me. And I liked it. My fingers, my fingers no longer shivered at his touch. Fingers still painted with his ink, my lord's veins on my hands, his prickling dried blood on me. He suddenly took my hand in his, wrapping his large fingers around mine. I jumped at the contact, my fever hitting high; he never touched me while I was washing him. I was the one touching him. Warm, but odd. I lifted my confused look to his face. Alluring. Majestic. Beautiful. Green eyed Goldenrod, Goldenrod stared at Firebrick. Wrath took reign of his features again. Rage readable on his pupils, his jaw clenched intensely, his eyebrows arched sharply, his irises darkening at the view he got. It wasn't Goldenrod anymore, it was shallow, deep, a pure shade of black. A vein popped out of his frown, the hurted one, the artist. A red drop fell on our wrapped palms, followed by a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth, they kept on falling, again and again, and again another time, till our bond was once again soaked. Firebrick drowned his fingers, drowning mine, drowning the cloth. My eyes examined the blood's origin, thankfully, it wasn't a harmful wound, a bit of ointment and time would alter it to a simple scratch, a memory, one that it held me in its story. I smiled at the thought. I felt a small tug on my hand, and I lowered my gaze, his fingers tracing the engraved passages of my scars, the marks my stories left. Bruises. Memories. It was then that I realized: Goldenrod wasn't eyeing firebrick. Dark Goldenrod was analyzing the painting. Dark Goldenrod was judging the painting. Dark was judging the painting. Furious. Infuriated. Angry. Dark was mad. He tightened his grip, more ink falling on his hold. Droplet after droplet, a hot bloody rain, burning every inch of my flesh, meeting it, covering it, as to hide my grazed hand. Who did this? Dark was mad. Furious. Infuriated. Angry. His voice holded a tone I despised the most: displeasure. My bruises, my memories, my marks, displeased him. My state embittered him. I displeased him. He was clearly disappointed in me. And it hurts. So I adopted what I always adopted: Silence. Do not speak even spoken to. I kept quiet under his screaming gaze, under his furious disappointment, under his. Hermania. He declaimed, loudly. Grip tightening, drops falling, gaze judging, voice ordering. Distaste. Disappointment. It hurts. Hot acidic tears burned my eyes in a vain attempt to be freed, but I wouldn't let them out, I couldn't let them out, I couldn't show, I couldn't feel. Not in front of Dark, not in front of Distaste, not in front of Displeasure. Feelings of frustration, rushed, took, hit my body down, building a void right in the middle of my chest, replacing the long gone emblazing fire. Heart. Ashes. They didn't matter anymore. My executioners didn't matter anymore, because he was theirs, they are nothing now, unimportant, nonexistent in front of him, they were none, all their darkness faded as my lord's fire enveloped me completely, blazing my insides, searing my desire. They didn't matter, they didn't haunt me, not anymore, he had made sure of it. You slaughtered them. My voice was serene, but my heart still ached, and my fingers were shaking while I applied some Yarrow ointment on his temple that I sometimes saw Briseis apply on the bleeding soldiers. As I must. Diomedes declared, boastful, proud, satisfied as his grandeur should. Hand down, he grabbed the wet cloth thrown on my knees, and rinsed it in a clear basin's water, wetting it again, cleaning it from his blood, his memories. He then lifted his eyes to meet mine: ink no longer adorning his features, boastful, proud, satisfied. His magnificent spoke: Undress, let me purify your body from my men's soiled touch. His men, mediocre, filthy. The fire was hot, the room was hot, my heart was hot, his words were hot, it was blazing, pleasing, intoxicating. My skin flushed as I took off my poor wrappings, matching my color with the flames, much to my lord's content, and much to mine. Humming, he signaled me to approach him. I crawled, slowly, steadily, gawkily, until he placed me between his thighs, my legs crossed in his warmth. Where I belonged. His hand hugged the cloth, the cloth hugged my skin, and it started scrubbing my whole body, cleaning his men's filth. Wet coarse fabric brushed my back, my neck, my arms, accentuating my searing when he reached my chest; wet hot liquid pasted my breasts, and I leaned against him, enjoying the feeling. Pleasure. Warm. Blazing. Calming. His touch was hot, my body was hot, my heart was hot. Sensations. Sensations. Sensations. Mix of unknown sensations took down my soul and spirit. It was blazing yet calming my soul. Hard were the hands of my lord, gentle were their moves on me. Pleasure. Sensations. He landed his head on my shoulder to stop my shiverings. Dark honeyed clocks caressing my cheek, his temple sticking some ointment on mine. Ink no longer firebrick. I shut my eyelids, feeling his caring grip on me: Calm embrace, gentle wiping. He passed through my whole painting till its dirt disappeared under the cloth's wetness. My heart no longer hurted. Suddenly, as he returned to my chest, the once gentle wiping turned into a ferocious war. Tight grip, feral scraping, flushed bosom. Red. Fire. My lord's favorite. I squeezed my closed eyes, forcing myself to endure the ache my jailor provided me, bearing his hard palms. Callous firm fingers quickly replaced the wet cloth; touching my breasts, moving them, pressing them, feeling them like the softest tissue of silk. My nipples hardened under his treatment: Brutal and savage. Spreading from my searing point a burning wave drowning me whole, diving till my deepest place and displaying its presence by a warm liquid escaping my core. I felt his mouth on my neck: sucking, licking, grazing my skin, striving my flesh into bloody flushed spots, marking me with his sharp teeth: Brutal and savage. I could barely contain my voice, aching to cry my sensations, eager to scream the pleasure he gave me, to shout his brutality, his barbarous ways that woke my innermost fantasies. But I kept quiet, shutting my lips as hard as I did with my eyes, because that's how a slave should be: Silenced. Whatever my lord gives, I shall take, voiceless. Callous fingers replaced the cloth, tracing my body's curves, all my scars and bruises, all my beauty and charm, leaving hot trails paths behind them, warming my insides, warming my ashes, my fire, searing. Sensations. Feelings of well being and ease overwhelmed my spirit. I felt wanted, I felt needed, I felt desired. My pride was at its peak. My existence was real. No longer the ghost wandering in the castle's libraries, no longer the unadorned royal servant, no longer my father's daughter, no longer a priest's shame; living on fortune slaves throw to their gods, drowning in luxuries that took the life out of my soul. Instead, I felt like dancing. I felt those dim poor alleys of the meagerest districts of Troy, taking mornings' hardships and singing nights' glories, bearing winter's diseases and celebrating summer's festivities. I felt like dancing. I felt life. Right in my butcher's hold. Still sucking my shoulder, his fingers thrusted my inner walls in one, hard, push. Making me feel him whole, every rigor of his claw marking my inside already wet by his foreplay. Gods, wet merely by his presence. Sensations. He pushed deep, I sensed three, but their thickness made me doubt, four, five perhaps... No three. Those weren't just normal hands, they were a king's, a conqueror's. Thick. Rough. Raw. They kept still, their upper part reaching my fevered level; so long, so taking, so conquering. Then they curled, and I yerked. Sensations. Sensations. Sensations. An intense thunderbolt hit my inner legs, I didn't know if it was my legs anymore, I didn't know anything anymore, felt nothing, nothing but an ardent pleasure taking my whole muscles down, all my sanity was gone. I couldn't take it, I couldn't take it, I couldn't take it, I couldn't take it. My body's never been this burning, my body's never been this well. It wasn't right, but it felt alright. I gasped for air, struggling to keep my voice to myself, so I opened my eyes to lessen my sensations, only to meet his beautiful petals, shining under the blazing pyre's glow. Mesmerizing goldenrod, watching my every move, my beauty and scars, my charming imperfections. Pressure took on my core as he deepened his fingers furthermore, making wince at the intrusion. Acidic salty tears started swimming on my cheeks, this time of pleasure, not frustration. My leaves begged him, my shivers begged him, my tears begged to let me scream my sensations at all lungs, only my voice didn't. Moan. Hot, chills, touch; Shout, scream, burn your lungs and throat with my name. Cry to all Greeks that you're mine, and I shall kill every protestant. My king roared. Grand, majestic, royal, demanding. And who was I to deny my king's demand? Who was I to refuse this freedom? His fingers started moving, and my moans sang at their rhythm, up and down, back and forth, teasing my tights that followed their cadence, down and up, back and forth, in and out. Again and again, and again another time, till my back arched under a wave of ecstasy, my screams transmitting its intensity, my soul feeling its sensations. I lied down, then my lord suddenly stood, and I closed my eyes. I tried to control my heavy breathing while assimilating what just happened; I don't know how I feel, relieved? Satisfied? Happy perhaps? I don't know, what I do know is the shallow emptiness that overwhelmed me when he exited my muscles, letting my bare behind bump against the woolen couch. Confusion began, unease continued, then frustration appeared, soon followed by my next sorrowful worry: Wasn't I enough? I felt silly, stupid even, my pride was hurt: Hermania, the beautiful Hermania who made men crawl in lust couldn't satisfy her lord's. I was lost, I was hurt, I was angry at that man for making me desire him, for making beg to get his attention, for making me feel worthless without even trying, every glimpse of confidence I had oon my body vanished under the weight of insecurities I didn't know of I had, till him, till his damned eyes scrutinized me. I felt beautiful at his touch, but his indifference was lethal. Beauty is a power, my power, the only thing that makes me relevant in this twisted world, so what am I if I'm not beautiful? Just a piece of useless carrion. All men desired me, all crawled at my moves, all pleaded for a night of pleasure, all begged to see me dance at their feet. Men, women, royals, subjects, everyone admired me, but I couldn't care less about everyone, all I care about is Diomedes. I couldn't care less about others compliments, others admiration, others lust... all I wanted was my lord's. Raw. Brutal. Real. He makes me feel, he makes me alive, and I like feeling, I like life. I like my lord, I like Diomedes, that's why I can't help but worry, fearing that he doesn't feel the same toward me. A loud sigh was emitted from the other corner of the room, as a response for my shambled feelings. Speak your concerns, Hermania. Only then I noticed that I was crying, tear after tear and another tear again, quietly but surely. My worries took the best of me. Another strong exclamation lounged over my whimpers, his gentle fingers brushed some hair strands from my face, the same fingers that were inside me were now swabbing my wet cheeks, switching form my sweet moist to my salty one. I directed my gaze to meet his: My lord. I whisper, I whimper. Why don't you admire me? I scream, I tear apart. All my sadness, all my frustration, all my insecurities leaked out in those words. Suddenly, shame and embarrassment leaked out on my face at his wide surprised eyes. Then, wonder and astonishment leaked out on my features at the sound of his laugh. Dulcet and euphonious. The most beautiful sound I've ever heard. He knelt in front of me, his eyes pried mine, amusement lingering in their soft golden light, shadowed but a hint of desire. He is pleased, he is aroused. and I like it. His body approached mine, his mouth muttered something under his hushed breath, muscles moving, veins dancing, forehead resting on mine, so close, so burning. Bright Goldenrod shadowed green. Petals covered leaves. His softness covered mine. Lips on lips. Sweet and sour. Claiming my being till its searing point, conquering everything, my body, my mind, my soul, my. He grabbed my waist, his strong arms carrying me to his bed, my flushed flesh on the featherlike covers, screaming royalty and riches, hiding passion and ardor, his body throwned mine, never breaking our contact. His mouth was eating me raw, tasting, teasing, claiming me as a king would claim. Crude and arrogant. He burned yet spoiled my pride, I felt wanted, needed, desired, admired. The best. He backed away, breaking our contact, admiring his claim, my body red by his marking, my lips bloodied by his treat. A mild smile graced his mouth at his work, he was pleased, I was too, until I heard his next utterance. I don't admire you Hermania. My lord said as he bent and licked my earlobe. I stiffed at his words, frowning when his eyes met mine, lust crowning his goldenrod, mixed with something else, care perhaps. I worship you woman. He alleged as he thrusted me raw, not caring to shuffle my cries as they resounded through the whole beach, if not all of Troy. Oh, my lord-. I moaned, my voice squeaky, before he shutted it with his own, grand, majestic, lustful: Quiet, let your body speak for you. He scolded while his hips pushed against mine, his thrusts getting wilder and wilder, flesh on flesh, sliding in my inside, till its deep spot, obliging my body to feel each inch of him, and to accept each drop of him as he filled my emptiness with his warmness. My back jumped at the contact with his burning liquid, vibrations, chills dispersed from my core to my now oversensitive shaking legs. It was hard, it was blowing, it was burning, much and much denser than the lasting fire, it was Diomedes. Gods, Hermania, you're heaven on earth, my heaven. Heaven on earth, heaven on a woman, heaven on me, right under the flaming hell of his, consuming my good the best way possible, right on the shine of our sin. Is it this? Is this how it feels when you're your admirer's admirer? Oh my lord, he stopped long ago, but my sensations didn't. Are you well? He asked, still inside me, and I nodded my head as he grabbed my head and started kissing my neck, a slight whimper was my response to his sweet applause. Words, precious. He softly demanded, his mouth went from licking to sucking my cheek. Yes my lord, I am. I murmured, embarrassment flushing on my face, he suddenly drew back, eyeing the very spot he sucked, desire clinging in his irises. Good, cause I don't plan on stopping. He laid down, his broad chest on mine, supported by his muscular shoulders so as to not crash me with his heavy weight. His arousal met mine, entering raw, taking me whole. I'm going to worship you, Hermania, from dusk till dawn. He promised, and he did. He admired me, He worshiped me, till the light of the day sprang on the music of our breaths.",

Carl Baxter grabbed the lever. His fingers wrapped around it as he grabbed it tight, strangling it in his grip. As he pushed it forwards, he could feel it. Pulling on him. Behind him was everything and nothing. A gaping maw, a hole in the world. Its name was Sagittarius A*, and it was his doom. The Kadana shook, pushing with all its might to break free from the pull of the black hole. It was an ugly spaceship. A garish red and gold, with an uncomfortable gradient down the middle. But it worked, and that was all Carl Baxter needed. Here, though, it was useless. He was like a fly in a bathtub, flapping its wings in vain. A sound. The engine was rattling. Carl Baxter pulled harder on the throttle, as if it would make him go any faster. His teeth ground together as his jaw tightened like a vice. The ship lurched backwards, with the engines finally giving out with a crack, and the Kadana slowed and stopped and reversed and Carl Baxter was stretched apart limb from limb and he screamed as he became a thin line of atoms and then quarks and then nothing. the real hal angry bird slammed trhough the windo and killed mack zuckerbird in one strkir, murderibng. \"watashi hwa the what!!! masaka!\" said dio. \"you kile myrk zuccki!!!!!!!!!1! this is not the epic desu! \" might y eagles slammed through the lack of window withe harrie styl warped around ihs toe. \"hi guys. this is me. harty style. hyou amay know me from semenal works sutch as. thie bibls 2 (the second onw\" and the bilbe 3. agragra grahhhhhh. i am eatign the dral dios breadono. \"know!!1 how could this happen! to me! i am the korno dio daa!!!!\" Harry Styles swallowed, smirking in contempt for the fallen vampire as he felt the remains of DIO slide down his oesophagus.

I hope you enjoy reading this and at anytime let me know what I can improve on Ps. This book began on Wattpad and my characters will look different as well as certain things like songs that can be played while reading but I will just insert at the top what song you should listen to/ goes with that chapter. Sea I think...I'm flying? I can't hear anything, but I feel the air coming through my clothes, nipping and biting at my pale skin. Should I open my eyes? Do I deserve to see what alluring sight awaits me? Dare I spot the clouds of silk that help the sky sing the most beautiful song? I'll do it.. On the count of three.. One... Two... Three! I open my eyes. I see blue, but not the one that is littered with thick marshmallow clouds that cover that damned sun, No. This blue waved at me, inviting me in to hear it's sad story of how everything ends for me. I see now that I was never flying...but falling. A muted scream pushes past my lips and I plunge into the water. It gathers it's hands around my throat and holds onto me, the creatures taunt me, the world is laughing at me. \"How unpleasant, How ironic, Sea, the deadly boy who was afraid of drowning.\" *RING* I jump up and glance around me. Everyone is leaving out of the classroom. I gather all my things and head to lunch making sure not to bump into anyone. \"Glad one of us could go to dreamlandis, I for one would've given my right leg to sleep in Greek Ancient History,\" Nina says when I sit down with my salad. \"Meanwhile I would've done anything to get out,\" I say stabbing my fork into the shades of green, \"Same dreams?\" Nina questions and I sigh. Nina is my best friend and she would probably kill me, heal me, and kill me again if I said otherwise. She's a healer, which got her quite the gig. She works as the school's athletic trainer and she has a side hustle of healing people for money or favors. She keeps it on the low of course since her mom is the school nurse. Nina and I laughed, well she laughed and I blew air out my nose, while sending each other funny videos, when he walks in. Big and famous jock from the big and famous family, Andreas. He's in his white and gold volleyball jersey and a pair of grey sweat pants. A golden'1' printed on the back. Damn him. He and his friends sit in the middle of the cafeteria, chanting and boosting one another up about the game tonight. \"Are you-\" Nina starts and I interrupt her \"absolutely not.\" She snorts at my usual answer, and at this point I think she asks if I'm going to school events to be funny. \"I figured\" she says standing up and I follow her out. Great --5th period with 'worlds best athlete' and his groupies. This is sadly the only class Nina and I don't share. I walk in and instantly wish I hadn't. 'Partner Project' is scribbled on the board in fresh chalk. I take my usual seat in the back and watch as others pour into the room, all avoiding seats around me. I would too I guess. \"Good morning class, let's hop right in! Yes, there's a partner project, No you aren't choosing your own partner.\" Ms. G states while slowly trotting around and giving everyone a rubric. Ms. G, of course, is a centaur and the G stands for Galina but she says G does just fine. \"I will now announce the names for the group partners...Ivy and Nova, Sophia and Cassian, Melody and Elara, Demitri and Troy,\" I no longer hear her voice as she continues, my 'partner' will more than likely want to work alone than with me. \"Lastly, Sea and Andreas\" Ms. G claps and My eyes nearly pop out of my head. The air in the room grows thick as Andreas brings his things over to where I'm settled in the back. \"We need you for the game tonight dre, don't die sitting next to that freak.\" His teammate, Maliki, spits, peering at me. I cower down into the desk further, trying to escape his gaze. Andreas doesn't look up from his phone but I see him glance near me. \"I'm sure things will be fine as long as they don't touch each other\" Elara chirps making everyone agree, turning around, but something seems off about Maliki. He shakes his head as if he were coming out of a trance. Too many volleyballs to the face. \"This project will help all of you to get to know one another! You must spend some time with each other and write a paper telling what makes each other's abilities special.\" Ms G says with a soft smile. The project is due the 15th of November, meaning I have to spend...A MONTH WITH HIM!? Andreas looks at me whilst I throw a silent tantrum like a small child. With one last toss of a piece of notebook paper, he speaks to me. His expression-- well expressionless. \"Come to the game tonight, here's my number.\" He slides a piece of torn paper to me and the bell sounds. Everyone leaves. I'm in awe for a second until I rewind what he said in my head..Come to the game. Come to...the game. Damnit Faster. Run Faster. Side to side on the court. Blocking, Defending, Attacking. Harder. Hit the ball harder. Fly into the air and hit the ball so hard it catches on fire, burning holes into the ground. More. Do more, play more. Maybe if I do more I won't have to be hurt. I won't have to be so--perfect. Andreas \"LEO. LEO. LEO. LEO.\" Our fans chant and cheer for us. We're up by 12 but in the game of volleyball anything can happen and I must stay focused. I stare holes into the opponents across from me. Demitri is up to serve. The crowd goes silent as he spins the ball in the palm of his hand. The sound of his hand and the ball mimics a cracked whip as he sends a jump serve over the net. The game is in motion. Pass, set, hit. The ball is recovered. Demitri passes the ball to Andy, Andy sets to me and I fly into the air--sending the ball hurling through the gap of hands and smashing into the center of the court. Leaving a mark. The gym erupts into screams. We continue this until we need the last two points to win. Coach signals us to do the play 'flake'. I serve the ball over, careful not to use all my strength, and put the game into play. Pass, set, attack. The ball is recovered by a dive from Royal. Here we go. Andy sets the ball and whole front row runs and jumps up swinging through to the left. What they didn't pay attention to was the ball being set back to the right corner of the back row. Cassian sends the ball over the net. Everything is moving almost in slow motion. The libero on the other side slowly connects the dots and dives for the ball--but he falls short. The ball lands in the far corner of the court. The team runs and picks cassian up as gold confetti pours down from the ceiling. I forgot this was the last game. Basketball here I come. I turn to head to the locker room when I see him. Head to toe in the same black as usual. This makes him stand out from the color filled crowd in a way. A single boat in the vast ocean. I go to him. Pushing past the team, moving through the crowd, throwing 'thank you' over my shoulder to people. I jog up the stairs and stand near him. \"You came\" I say and he emits a small smile. \"I figured everyone would save me a seat so\" Sea jokes and I grin. My Father walks up but stands a good distance away from Sea. \"Your Dad and I are headed back now. Don't forget you start your new training tomorrow so don't be out any later than 2am.\" He says in a cold voice and walks off. Sea visibility shivers at his tone and hops up from where he's seated. \"Well, I should be starting home now,\" he says looking down at his shoes with his hands behind his back. \"Yeah me too, let me know when you want to start working on the project since you probably couldn't get much out of one game.\" I say and he nods. \"Actually...are you busy at all tonight?\" I ask and he looks at me like I have three heads. \"I know a place where we can go and talk without people being so judgmental towards you,\" I continue and he looks kind on the fence about it. \"Don't worry about it too much, Just let me know okay.\" I say and walk away to the locker rooms. Sea \"NOT A DATE WITH THE FAMOUS BOY FROM THE FAMOUS FAMILY! I thought you hated him,\" Nina cackles at me and I grow frustrated. \"I asked you for help not jokes damnit, should I go or not, what if he kidnaps me!\" I stress, pulling at my hair. \"Did you forget you can't touch people and they can't touch you either?\" She says and I stare at her...I forgot about that. \"Well then I'll go...and I do hate him, his perfect family, perfect life. He's never once felt pain or been hurt. He will never know what it's like to be alone. I absolutely loathe him,\" I say and pick out a sweater. I should switch it up right? I go to the closet and shuffle through my clothes. Black. Black. Black. Black. Ooo black and yellow let's shake it up a little. My phone dings from my bed and Nina dives on top of it before I can get there. \"Your boy toy asked what time will you be ready?\" She snickers and I roll my eyes. \"Eight\" I say and she texts him back and sends the address. What have I gotten myself into? Once upon a time, there was a story about a rock named Bellona. She was the leader of the rocks. She taught them how to fight against the monsters above, how to lead and trust no one but each other. All the rocks respected her power and the way she moved with grace. One day, Bellona was stolen from the water. Big hands dipping down and pulling her from her kingdom. Her and the monster battled back and forth but she was overpowered. She was taken back with the monster and kept in their palace above. Over time Bellona came to love the monster and they had a child. Bellona took the child back to see her warriors and they were disgusted by her and her creation. They beat her. They cursed her and called her names. They killed her for being a traitor, for being so 'weak.' Her creation escaped and went back home to his father to tell him everything that happened. His father went to the ocean and laid his hands into the water--throwing and breaking every rock in the chill of rushing blue and green. Never again did the lives of rocks and humans collide. Sea I open my eyes and sigh. The water hits my ghostly pale skin, comforting me. Giving me the hug I always longed for. I get out and wrap my black towel around my waist. Nina left awhile ago but not before taunting me further. The clock on my dresser says 7:42. I get dressed in my black skinny jeans and the black and yellow sweater I picked earlier. By the time I dry and style my hair it's 8 and the door bell rings. I pad down the steps and see Andreas talking with my father. \"Great game tonight son, you really have an arm on you!\" My dad says. He's always been a big sports fan. \"I'm a big fan of your work as well, killing millions with a tap to the ground from your scythe.\" He gawks, looking towards the impenetrable, one handed Scythe my dad has hanging on the wall. I clear my throat and they look at me with surprised looks. \"Kiss already,\" I gag, rolling my eyes. My dad scratches the back of his neck and gets up. \"Alright boys I'll see myself out. Have him home in one piece Andreas. If not...well you know what I could do to you.\" He says to him with a smile. \"I wouldn't have it any other way\" Andreas says and we walk outside. He presses a button and both the doors on his car go up. Show off. \"Where are we going anyway.\" I ask putting the seatbelt on. \"Only the best spot in town,\" He grins, pulling off. Great. Andreas The drive isn't too far from where Sea lives so I don't try to make small talk. My Apple Music softly plays 'See you again' by tyler, the creator, creating background noise. I park the car and we get out. I start walking and he shuffles behind me, kicking a few rocks and stepping on dead leaves. We're coming up on the place I mentioned and Sea stops walking. \"Is that...water?\" He says becoming tense. \"Yeah, the water falls over the rocks on the other side of this tunnel.\" I say and he visibly starts shaking. \"We don't have to go near the water--it's just somewhere I like to come and sit. We could stay in the tunnel if you'd like.\" I say and he still looks like I'm holding a sword to his throat. \"Take my han-\" I start and I mentally slap myself when I remember. I look around for something. I see a small root coming from the ground and I rush to pull it up. \"Take the other end of this root,\" I say looking in his eyes, \"There's absolutely no reason why I would or would want to hurt you in anyway possible.\" I say gazing into his eyes. He hesitates for a second. There's no sound throughout the tunnel, only the endless down pour of the water, smoothing out the rocks. He takes the other side. I nod and force out the breath I didn't know I was holding. We walk beside each other. Slow, cautious footsteps until we step outside the tunnel and around the corner to the rocks. We settle on a dry rock that shows a good view of the glowing water. Sea is absolutely terrified. \"Tell me something about yourself,\" I say to distract him. His eyes dart around, looking anywhere but the water. \"I'm seventeen,\" is all that falls out. It's a start. I continue short questions like 'what's your favorite color' and he finally calms down a bit. \"So you had to do your piercings on your own?\" I ask and he nods. \"They didn't hurt too bad, but the labret surely made me pass out afterwards.\" He says and I cringe at the thought. They do suit him though. \"I admire your strength.\" I say and look out at the water. \"How come you play all these sports? Do you ever take a break?\" He asks and I keep staring at the water. I put down the root and turn to him. \"Can I open up to you about something?\" I ask him and he turns his head to the side. \"Why are you confused?\" I question. \"Well, I just figured your life was simple you know. You work out, go to school, practice and play at your games. The only pain you'd ever endure is if you scrape your knee or something. What is there to open up about?\" He says and I'm at a loss for words. \"We're leaving.\" Is all I can say before I get up and go back to my car. \"Doll we're going to be late for school, hurry out the bathroom!\" My mom says and I quickly untie the band from my arm. I discard the needle in a sharps container and look at myself in the mirror. My pupils are blown. \"let's go!\" Says mama which makes me jump out of my trance. I heal my arm and leave out the bathroom. Nina We get to school and I say goodbye to my mom saying I'll see her later. I feel like I'm practically floating to class, I should do this way more often. \"Hey Nina.\" Sea says when I sit down beside him. \"Why so down my love? Date didn't go well?\" I ask him and he sighs telling me what happened. \"This is why I tell you not to judge others, we don't know what people are going through and anything we say, even if it's small, could break someone down.\" I say softly. Sometimes Sea judges people before he even gets to know them. \"What do I do Nina?\" He asks slumping down in his desk. \"Apologize..obviously. Life is like...swimming! Some of us are scared of it, some of us don't care for it, and some of us find joy in it, but all of us are just trying not to drown.\" I say and the teacher comes in. I check the clock on the wall again. 10 minutes left in this class. It's so hot in here. I chug my water bottle until it's gone but I can't escape this thirst. I can't..move my arms. Why can't I move my arms? A bead of sweat rolls down from my damp hair to my chin. What's going on? The bell rings and everyone gets up to leave out the room. I drag myself out the desk and stumble to the next class. This time I sit in front of the vent. I pull another water out my bag and down it in one go. I'm fine. ~Two classes later~ I think I'm going to vomit. I stare at the tray in front of me and cringe. I pick up the brown and green slop on the spoon and it falls off due to being soupy. Bile comes up from my stomach to my throat and I take off in a sprint to the bathroom. I'm glad Sea had a test to do during lunch, I hate making him worry. I hack up my breakfast and water then slump back against the stall door. Someone comes into the bathroom and I pull myself off the floor. I flush the toilet and go to rinse my mouth out. \"Good heavens! Nina you look terrible, are you okay?\" I ignore her and continue rinsing. \"Really Nina you should go to the nurse-,\" she starts and I slam my hands down onto the counter. \"Fuck off Malibu Barbie!\" I spit at her and she runs out the bathroom sobbing. Damnit Nina, she was trying to be nice. Why did I do that? I need to heal myself. I take deep breaths and start to heal myself inside and out. It's a lot cooler now. My stomach doesn't hurt. My arms feel so much lighter. I leave the bathroom and get my book bag which contains another shirt. I write down what all happened today in my journal and look at myself in the mirror. I guess I'll try a new drug tomorrow. My beautiful Sea. Carry with you what I've said. Never judge a book by the cover, for most covers can be misleading. They hide the real story within. You must read the book from cover to cover, learn and respect it's story even if you don't fully understand it. If everyone were to judge the book by its cover and never read it, it would be like tearing the book apart. Sea I can do this. Right? I walk in class all while thinking up a plan to apologize to Andreas. Maybe I should write him a note! I take out a fresh sheet of paper and scribble down what all I wanted to say before the bell ring for class. Andreas walks in but he sat further away from me than before. He's wearing sunglasses today. I fold the note and frisbee it to his desk. He looks up from his phone and grabs the note. Yes! He gets up with the note and walks across the classroom to throw the note in the trash. So much for that plan. I sit back and slide down deeper into the desk chair. I really fucked this one up. A vision of my mom flashes in my head and I smile. She was always so beautiful. We walked hand in hand through the tall grassy meadows of her kingdom. People start to surround us and draw their weapons. \"How could you? How do you teach us to fight against the gods but fall for one yourself?\" One of them yells. \"You traitor!\" Some yell, \"you trash!\" Say others. My mother tries to speak but it's too late. The blade of her second in command pierces through her stomach in a swift motion. I feel a tear roll down my face and the bell rings. Everyone is gone. ~Later that day~ I need to find him and apologize but he won't stop avoiding me. I rush outside when the last bell rings to find him before he left. I see him walking to his car and I jog after him. \"Andreas wait!\" I say but he doesn't look back. He opens and closes his doors before I could get there. At this point I'm furious. \"You've avoided me for two days! I've been trying to apologize since after lunch and you won't even acknowledge me! All because I called you out on your perfect life! Some of us have a reason to feel helpless and hopeless! Some of us have a reason to want to die!\" I scream out banging on the window with both of my fists. He snaps his head towards me and I stumble away from the door. The door to his car flies off and across the field, barely missing my head. He gets out and his breath is rigged. \"You can't possibly be that fucking shallow and empty minded towards other peoples feelings! Just because people don't show their pain and don't want a fucking pity party doesn't mean we don't endure pain at all!\" He snatches off his sunglasses and I gasp. His right eye was black and purple, swollen shut. \"Is this what it takes to please you? Is this what you want to see!\" He then takes off his shirt and turns around showing his back. Deep cuts and bruises old and new cover his body making me collapse to my knees. He walks up to me and I knee walk backwards to try and get away from him but an apple tree, that I didn't see there before, came into the way. He hovers over my face. \"Pain comes in different forms. Is this enough fucking pain for you?\" He spits. There's a crowd around us with their phones out. Some students have their mouths covered as they observe the horror that is his beaten and bloodied back. He turns to walk away and the crowd separates for him. He drives away and the crowd closes in on me. The baseball team emerges from the crowd and comes up to me with bats in hand. All at once they break me down with full swings. Swings to different parts of my body but all in unison. I curl up my body to escape it but it's no use. The crowd is silent as it happens. No cheers, no shouting of how much I deserve it. They look almost as if they were in a trance. Stuck in one place not even blinking. Everyone but Elara. Her hair floating a bit. She notices me looking at her but before I could say anything or connect more dots, I'm hit over the head and I black out. 'It's like tearing the book apart' 60 mph. I press my foot down harder on the gas sending the car flying down the road. 90 mph. Stop whining, they don't like when you show your emotions. Nothing is good about you, be more like your brother, be more perfect. 130 mph. You never could live up to your father's expectations. You're too emotional, you're so sensitive, are you about to cry? You don't work hard enough, you don't push hard enough. You aren't enough! 200 mph. The world looks at you and sees a pathetic excuse for a warrior, an athlete--a son. Andreas I lie on my back and stare out into the water. The cuts on my back being soothed by the cold rock. I have an impulsive thought and I quickly stand up. I take off my pants and straighten out my shorts that were underneath. I go to the edge of the cliff and turn around backwards. Letting the wind and gravity push me, I fall off. My eyes are closed and just for a second--It feels as if I was flying. I gather my hands together above me and curve my back, breaking through the surface of the water. I sink down to the bottom and stay there for a little while longer. The feeling of not being able to hear anything or see anything is comforting me. I don't have to worry. I swim back to the surface and lay onto the rocks. Footsteps approach me and I jump up only to see...well Sea. He has a busted lip and a line of dried blood on his neck. He stumbles and I run to catch him but i quickly retreat my arms when I remember. He hits the ground with a light thud and a groan. \"Sorry about that.\" I wince. I lay next to him and he turns his head to look at me. \"What happened to you?\" I ask him and he sighs. \"Elara I think.\" He says and I look at him crazy. \"Elara did this?! She wouldn't hurt a fly. Or so I thought.\" I said propping myself up on my elbow. \"What I want to know is why she would do it. I've never even spoke to Elara before and all of a sudden I'm getting beat up.\" He says with his eyes closed. \"How come you didn't just ask Nina to heal you?\" I ask and he opens his eyes. \"I deserve this for being prejudice and thinking your pain was inferior to mine. Also...not believing that everyone goes through things.\" He says never breaking eye contact. \"I don't believe in people deserving bad things unless you truly are a terrible person. What you did wasn't right but at the same time everyone is going to judge someone once in their life, maybe even more. It doesn't make it right or justify what you did but it happens. Just don't do it again.\" I tell him and he nods his head. \"What happened to you Andreas?\" Sea asks me. I guess it's time I tell someone the truth. I take in a deep breath and turn to look him in the eyes. \"My father, Hercules, he abuses me...mentally and physically.\" I say and he looks at me with shock written on his face. \"No matter what all I do, he will always put me down. He calls me lazy, sensitive, a waste of space, everything in the book of terrible parenting.\" I say laying down on my back. \"The punishments are the most excruciating thing I have ever gone through and it's different every time. It's like he has a list of fucked up things he dreams of doing, and uses it on me. When I was 14 he-- He chained me to a tree and dowsed me in a liquid. He then smoked a cigarette in front of me and flicked the end of it towards me. My body lit up like I was a fucking firework. The flames licked and prodded at my body, all like an unwanted encounter. I screamed for what felt like hours as he watched. I thought I died that day but I woke up in my bed. My body was perfectly fine. I learned later that he had a deal with a healer.\" I turn to him and he has tears in his eyes but he quickly wiped them away. \"I'll tap his should if you want me to.\" He says in a serious tone that makes me smile. \"Oh I've thought about a couple of things myself but since I'm leaving for college soon I figured I should leave him be. My father and my Dad love each other more than I've seen or needed to hear.\" I say cringing. We lie there in silence for awhile and listen to the waterfall. \"How come you're so afraid of water?\" I ask Sea and he curves his body, looking down to his shoes. \"Well, when I was younger my father took me to Key West for vacation. Back then I loved water and had no problem with getting in, so I did. \"My father and I had this obsession with finding sunken ships and on this vacation we planned to find another. We dove off into the water with our diving gear on and swam near the bottom where it was laying. That's when we saw it--'The Argo'. I asked my father to take pictures of me in front of the ship so he turned and swam a fair distance away to get everything in the picture. When he got there and turned around, he immediately started swimming back. I was confused why he didn't get the picture and why he was shouting and waving his hands around for me to come to him. I was making my way to him when I felt the water behind me move. Swimming behind me was the Lernaean Hydra. I couldn't do anything but stare at it, I was so afraid. It came at me but my father was faster. He pulled me out the way and laid both hands around the neck of the main head, and he killed it. It's body never decomposed so it still lies at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.\" He finishes telling his story and I stare at him. I have nothing to say but I want to hug him. No swimming dates, got it. Wait what did I just say. I roll over to face Sea and he is already looking at me. \"Tomorrow we should go see Cassian, if anyone could help us find out what's going on with Elara, it's Cassian.\" I say and he nods, his eyes heavy. \"Come on I'll take you home.\" I tell him and I get up. I'll leave the pants I wore here. I pull off a thick piece of bark from the tree nearby and throw it down next to sea. \"Get on.\" Is all I say and he rolls over onto it with a grimace. I pick him up and hold him like I'm a waiter. We make small talk until we get to the car and we get in, going back home. The rake moves violently. Pulling, bending, and shaping the autumn red leaves into perfection. They're currently wet from the down pour of rain half an hour ago. \"Cassian, honey, are you making poems about your hair again?\" My mom asks walking past the bathroom with the laundry basket in her hands. \"Uhh...no.\" I say but she knows when I'm lying. I put the rake I mean comb down and push past her, heading downstairs to breakfast. Cassian I look at myself in my mirror once more, saying my affirmations. I close the locker and let out a horror movie scream when I come face to face with three wide smiles. I clear my throat and narrow my eyes at them. \"To what do I owe the pleasure?\" I say and they all start talking at once. \"HEY hey one at a time!\" I yell over them and they settle down. \"Sea and I need your help finding out why Elara caused a random act of violence against Sea in my behalf.\" Andreas says and I turn to Nina expectedly. \"Oh I just tagged along, Sea here is my best friend and I don't want to kill anyone without knowing what I'm going to jail over.\" She says leaning against the lockers. A healer that kills. What's next, someone calling me ugly? Yea right. Snaps in front of my face bring me out my thoughts. \" Can you help us Cass?\" Andreas asks with pleading eyes. \"Yes but only because I've sensed something going on as well, we'll talk at lunch.\" I say walking to first. I place down my books beside my usual seat and sit down, waiting for class to start. Elara walks in with her preppy attitude and flower crown, leaving a trail of tulips behind her. What is she hiding. ~Lunchtime~ I sit down in front of Sea at his lunch table. \"Sea, tell me what's been going on.\" I say chewing my salad. He looks around to see if anyone is watching and then leans forward. \"I've noticed that bad things only happen when she sees me and Andreas around each other.\" He says and I stop chewing. Does she have a thing for Andreas? Is that why she's doing all this? \"Sea, I need you and Andreas to act a little lovey dovey. I think these might be acts of jealousy from Elara because she wants Andreas all to herself.\" I say and his eyes go wide. \"What do you mean lovey dovey? Can't I just tell her I'm not interested?\" Andreas asks and I shake my head at him. \"No we need to know if this is the real reason first.\" I say picking up more salad. \"You never said what you meant by lovey dovey.\" Sea sputters, his eyes still wide. I roll my eyes and think for a second. \"Like fake dating, you know? People still do that right? Go on dates, be at each other's house, walk together in public, that sort of thing.\" I say and Andreas spits out his Powerade. \"I can't, I mean I want to but, I don't think, it's not that there's anything wrong with Sea it's just, I-\" he rambles on for at least 40 seconds before I hold up my hand. \"It's the only way we can get to the bottom of this.\" I tell him and stand up to throw away the rest of my salad. \"This starts today in 5th, let me see your best acting skills ladies!\" I yell back at them leaving the lunch room. I walk into fifth period and sit down near the front of the room. I turn around and give Andreas and Sea two thumbs up to give them a little more confidence and it seems to work. Andreas leans and wraps his arms around the back of Sea's desk chair, close but not touching him of course. I smile and turn around to talk with Sofia. The bell rings and the class starts, the classroom loud with students talking, the topic being themselves or their abilities and parents. I jot down more things about Sofia and something, well more like someone, catches my attention. Elara. She's tapping at her phone aggressively while looking in the back corner. She's looking at Sea and Andreas, but who is she texting? Her face lights up and she smirks. \"Ms. G, my stomach is killing me, can I go to the nurse's office?\" She says with a pained voice. Ms. G glances her over, not fully believing it, but letting her out anyway. 20 minutes later Is it raining or some shit, my hair is getting wet with these wretched drops of water from the ceiling. Wait. Drops of water? Where is this coming from? \"Ms. G, the ceiling above me is leaking and it's really fucking with my hair.\" I say mumbling that last bit. \"Yeah, mine too.\" \"And me!\" I look around to see the ceiling raining drops of water all around us. Ms. G looks like she's seen a ghost or something. \"We need to exit the building quickly in a single line.\" She says cautiously, picking up her belongings. \"Ms. G what's going on where is this water coming from?\" I say in a panic picking up all my stuff along with everyone else. \"Well my dear, above us is the main pipe to the whole school. This pipe is connected to all the water in the entire building of the school. This means if that pipe has burst like I believe it has--the whole school is going to flood.\" She says and I can't believe what I'm hearing. How in the world did this happen. This school has been here for centuries. I try to think of what could've happened while walking out the room but something catches my eye. A single petal of a tulip in the small level of water in the hallway. Flower petals? Ponder to myself for a moment and a flash of this morning comes into my mind. Elara! This is the story of how I die. It's a funny story really but kind of not funny at all. The water rushes under the door filling up the closet at a fast pace. There's nowhere left for me to run. My screams are no longer screams but low cries. My bloodied fist never stop pounding on the door. No one hears me. No one's coming. How did I get here? Sea Ms. G leads us down several flights of stairs trying to keep everyone calm. We get to the second floor and there's complete chaos. Someone is blocking off the second floor staircase, Underclass men are screaming at the top of their lungs, paper and other objects are floating through the now knee high water and some kid is holding a mop from the janitor's closet. Ms. G looks around for another possible exit but there's no use. We're stuck. Or so I thought. \"Sea come this way.\" Andreas whispers, pointing down to the end of the hallway. We quietly back off from the crowded hall and down the other, splashing and kicking up water. \"There's a stairwell down this way, I don't know how no one though of it.\" He says reaching for the doorknob and twisting but it doesn't budge. That's why. He takes a step back and charges at the door, taking it down. We run through the doorway and down the stairs before anyone notices us. The first floor a little less chaotic with the bottom floor students standing outside already. We trudge through the water to the door. We finally reach it and hear a scream. Andreas and I look at each other and back to the end of the hall. Another scream. Andreas runs through the water towards the screams. \"Get the others from upstairs and lead them outside. Stay outside no matter what happens, don't come back for me!\" He says and turns down a hallway. Born to be a hero I see. I push a trash can that was nearby into the doorway, holding it open, and the water quickly pours outside the opening. I rush back up the stairs and into the second hall floor. It's even more crowded than I last saw it. People pushing and shoving their way down the stairs, starting fights. Do I yell and have everyone pushing to get this way or should I gather small groups of people and lead them down? Yeah there's no question there. I slosh down the hall to Ms. G and the students that are still with her and I whisper to her about the stairs. Little by little I did that, waiting 10 seconds in between, and the hall was a little less chaotic. I look out the window and see everyone making it outside. \"LOOK THE STAIRCASE IS OPEN!\" Andrew screams, drawing attention to where he was running. Shit. A slew of people start running past me and down the stairs. A book bag bumps me and I tumble back falling into the janitors closet, hitting my head on the shelf. Holding my head in my hands, I get up and stumble towards the door but it slams closed before I get there. I turn the knob and push but the door doesn't open. It's locked. I start screaming and banging on the closet door but to my horror I hear a door in the distance close. The only door that was open was this one-- and the double doors downstairs. I look around for something to open the door with. Cleaning chemicals, mops and brooms, janitor's cart. I grab the cart and brace myself. Running at full speed, I push the cart into the door but I fly back instantly and the door doesn't move. I try it again and again but it doesn't work. \"Im doing more damage to my fucking self.\" I say aloud kicking a jug of something over. I pull my hair back and look down. The water is waist high and rising as more water pours into the closet. I have to get out of here soon. I try everything, from trying to break off the doorknob, to pouring different combined chemicals on the handle. I climbed the shelf to get away from the water but it wasn't sturdy. Nothing worked. I slam my fists onto the door and cry silently. There's nowhere to go. This is how I die With tears sliding down my face and my head still pressed to the door, I start to sing. my voice breaking with the words. \"Track suits and red wine, movies for two. We'll take off our phones and we'll turn off our shoes. We'll play Nintendo, though I always lose. Cause you'll watch the tv, while I'm watching you. There's not many people, I'd honestly say, I don't mind losing to, but there's nothing, like doing nothing, with you.\" By the time I stop singing the water is up past my ears. I stand on the tips of my shoes and look up, saying my last goodbyes as the water goes over my head. I guess that's the story of how I die. Cassian 'This bitch, flooded the entire fucking school over a man?! If I ever liked someone that much they better be buying me damn Prada! I wish I had of caught that bitch but she led me right into a trap. Fucking eels. That's what I said!' Andreas nudges my shoulder and I stop talking to myself. \"Look I know you're mad and I'm glad you're okay, but we need to find Sea. He wasn't outside when we looked so he has to be in here somewhere.\" He says with his hands on top of his hat. Andreas is the one that found me in the cafeteria, fighting off 4 eels. When he found me I had a lunch tray in one hand and a crowbar in the other. I was kicking eel ass. The screams he heard being war cries. The worst part is, that vernon, ruined my best top! For that I should've skinned it, but Andreas pulled me away. \"You're right. Where did you last see him?\" I ask him as we wander through the waist high water. \"We were downstairs and on the way outside when we heard a scream and I ran off leaving him. I told him to go help others. If something happened to him it's all my fault.\" He says and I rub his shoulder. \"We're going to find him and get out of here, I promise.\" I say trying to ease some of his stress. We go up to the second floor and look around. Andreas takes one end of the hall and I take the other. I look through the classroom windows and walk up to lockers. He wasn't here. I walk to Andreas' side of the hallway to tell him what I saw but something stopped me. It sounded like...singing? \"But there's nothing like doing nothing, with you.\" I look around and run to where it's coming from, Andreas behind me. We come to a closet and I try to open the door but it's locked. Andreas stands back and goes to run through it but I stop him. \"Can I try something?\" I ask and he looks at me stupid. \"He could be hurt in there, hurry up!\" He says and I smile. I hook the crowbar into the door where the lock is and stand back. I center all my anger and I yell at top of my lungs running at the bar. I jump up and kick the crowbar with all my might and it breaks open the door, wood splintering off and flying in different directions. Water immediately streams out of the closet, carrying Sea out with it. Sea sits up and leans back onto the lockers, coughing loudly. \"Great singing voice buddy, don't think we would've found you without it.\" I tell him and he blushes, holding his head down. I look to Andreas to see relief written on his face. All is well. Or so I thought. \"DEEP BLUE SEEEEEA! WHERE ARE YOU HONEY, I JUST WANT TO TALK!\" Yells Elara from the stairwell. \"Your ill favored friend killed my eels, and you're a little too close to my man!\" She says. Wait Ill favored?! This bitch. I got this. Andreas Cassian runs down the main stairs and leaves me and Sea. So much for that. Just as we turn to leave Elara emerges from the stairwell. \"Don't.\" She says with a hand up. She looks crazy. Well she is crazy. Her hair is messy and her flower crown is now black. Her makeup slightly running down her face. \"I didn't want things to happen like this. We could've been something the world looked up to. The power couple of everyone's dreams!\" She screeches. \"Elara, we've never even talked before, we don't know anything about each other, how do you know that you all of a sudden love me?\" I yell back and she laughs. She advances towards us slowly. \"Your full name is Andreas Nicholas Power. Your favorite color is Red, you like to go to that watering hole on the other side of town when you want to be alone, and you sleep with a stuffed polar bear named icy.\" She says at the middle of the hallway now. \"Why do you know that stuff, have you been stalking me?\" I say and she looks offended. \"How else was I supposed to get to know you?\" She asks with a pout and I narrow my eyes at her. \"Oh I don't know, Fucking talk to me like a normal person?! You're psychotic!\" I yell at her. \"Well it doesn't matter anyhow.\" She says and her hair starts to float, her eyes turning completely white. \"Since you want to touch him so badly, I think I should help you both out with that.\" She says and looks at Sea. He looks at me with pleading eyes before they go completely blank. He then starts walking towards me with a hand reached out. In the corner of me I see Cassian come up the stairs and slowly walks near Elara. \"Wait Elara!\" I say and she stops Sea's movement. \"You know, there's one thing you didn't get right about me.\" I say and she cocks her head to the side. \"What?\" She asks confused. \"My favorite color isn't Red, it's Blue--like the Sea.\" I finish and Cassian hits her over the head with the crowbar. \"GET CROWBARRED, BITCH!\" He yells as she falls to the ground with a splash. The cops run up behind Cassian and put reach into the water, putting cuffs on Elara. I look to Sea and something comes over me. His hair is hanging down, just above his dark blue eyes. His wet clothes that clung to his body. His pale skin shining in the sunlight from the windows. The fact that he's WALKING OVER HERE RIGHT NOW! Ok act cool. \"Hey, you okay?\" He asks and I have to blink twice before I answer. \"Uh yeah, I'm fine. I'm sorry about the closet...and Elara.\" I say scratching the back of my head. \"You couldn't have known the thing with the closet was going to happen, glad you and Cassian found me though. The only thing that matters is everyone's okay.\" He says. \"Im should get going now, before someone floods the city over you.\" He says laughing and walking towards the stairs. I watch him walk away but before he's gone... \"Do you need a ride?\" I blurt out and he stops walking. \"Sure.\" Tall green and yellow grass stood on the ground, reaching for the sky. The air thick with the smell of salt water. I push myself through the grass and to the deck. The water beckons me, but my feet don't move. My chest tightens. It's getting harder to breathe. A hand grabs mine. The hand was bigger than mine, smooth and soft on the top but rough on the bottom. Andreas. I smile up at him and we walk hand in hand to the edge of the deck. When we reach the end he lets go. I turn to him confused. \"Letting yourself free from this fear that's holding you, is something you have to do alone.\" He says and I reach for him again, grabbing his hand. \"Please, Stay here with me.\" I say but to my surprise he leans in, and kisses my forehead. His touch slowly fading away. I turn to the water and let out a sigh. Without anymore thought I run and jump in. Soaring shortly though the air, the breeze caressing my skin. Sadly, as soon as I hit the water-- Sea I wake up. I jolt forward looking around, realizing that the car has stopped in front of my house. Well, no conquering fears today. Not even in my dreams. \"You okay? You were saying my name while you were asleep.\" He says smirking. \"Oh Andreas, Stay with me Andreas, kiss me Andreas!\" He says, mocking me dramatically and fake making out with himself. I just sit there amused. \"You wish I liked someone like you.\" I laugh and he leans in closer to me. I can feel his breathing tickling my nose. I look up at him. \"How do you know you don't?\" He says looking at me. I blink rapidly and lean back from him. \"Have you ever seen...SAW?!\" I ask trying to change the subject and he chuckles. \"Yeah, which is your favorite?\" He asks me and I say the 2nd one, due to the needle pit. \"I like the 3rd one since the traps are unbeatable.\" He says and I look at him stupid. \"Where's the fun in that?\" I say and he shrugs. \"It's just fun to watch. 10/10 traps, especially the one in the classroom.\" He says and yeah he's crazy. Things get quiet and he clears his throat. \"Come on I'll walk you to your door.\" He says looking at me. We get out the car, which has a new door, and walk to my door. I pick up the key from underneath the mat and I turn back to him. \"Thanks for the ride.\" I say trying to make conversation. \"Oh, yeah, anytime.\" He says rubbing the back of his neck. \"Well...I should go. Have a goodnight Sea\" He says and turns away, jogging down the stairs to his car. \"Andreas wait!\" I yell and he turns around. \"Do you..maybe want to come inside and watch a movie or something?\" I ask him and he smiles, walking back and into the house with me. \"Uh, I'm sure there's a some clothes in my room that are too big for me. Come on.\" I say walking upstairs. We get to my room and I push open the door, heading to the dresser. Andreas walks around the room and looks at things on the wall. \"Is this your mom?\" He asks and I look back at the photo he's pointing to. \"Yeah that's her holding me when I was 6 months I think.\" I say looking for the clothes again When I finally find the clothes, I hand them to Andreas. He puts down his hat and takes off his shirt, throwing it to the ground, and I'm stunned. His golden brown skin glows in the room lighting. His body looks as if it were hand sculpted by Michelangelo. His broad shoulders, and lean build with bulky muscles. Abs that seem to go on forever. I drag my eyes down his stomach and stop at his very prominent, very deep and muscular v line... Andreas clears his throat. I jump out of my trance and I feel a blush creeping up my neck. \"No free shows.\" He says laughing and I mentally slap myself. \"Right, sorry.\" I say and grab some clothes for myself and head to the bathroom. I close the door and turn on the faucet, splashing cold water on my face. Get it together Sea. I come out the bathroom moments later with fresh clothes on. I check the room to see if Andreas was still there and he was. He made himself comfy atop of the bed and was scrolling through his phone. I grab the remote and sit down next to him. \"What do you want to watch?\" I ask and he puts his phone down. \"What are my options.\" He says and I smile. ~Two hours of 'where the crawdads sing' later~ \"How can you say that!\" I say throwing a pillow at him and he catches it. \"Just because the necklace was in the book doesn't mean she killed him!\" He says tossing it back and I dodge it. \"It makes perfect fucking sense! She got on the bus, killed him, and went back!\" I say throwing my hands around. \"Or maybe she came back and found him like that and snatched it off his neck! How did she get rid of fingerprints and was able to have no one at all identify her?\" He says sitting up. I slap my forehead and sigh. \"I don't know Andreas.\" I say and he does a small celebration and sits back onto the headboard. \"Exactly. I'm picking the next movie.\" He says grabbing the remote at the same I reach for it. Our hands touch. We look at each other and jump apart. I look at him with panic and he starts patting his body, expecting something to happen. It never did. \"How does this work! Is it supposed to be a slow painful death?\" He asks and I panic more. \"I don't know! Are you in pain?!\" I yell. \"I don't know, my head kinda hurts.\" He says freaking out. \"Wait how do you not know how your own abilities work?\" He says looking at me and I stop pacing around. \"Well I've never used them before. They came to me on my 10th birthday like everyone else but I figured I was like my dad. Whatever he touches dies. So I didn't want to touch anything.\" I say and he looks at me like I'm crazy. \"Your dad and I shook hands when we first met.\" He says and I'm dumbfounded. \"Show me the letter you got on your birthday.\" He says and I walk over to the chest on my dresser. I open it and fish out the letter I received from Zeus. I give him the letter and sit on the edge of the bed. \"Happy birthday blah blah your ability is to touch anyone and make the worst thoughts or memories come to their mind ending in suicide blah oh here! Your ability works only when you allow it to do so and does not keep you from touching anyone or anything.\" He reads off the letter and looks at me. \"Have you never read this?\" He asks and I shake my head. \"I let my dad open it but I didn't want to hear what it had to say and just expected the worst all this time.\" I say playing with my hands. Andreas sighs, all the fear flowing out his body. \"Come here.\" He says patting the spot next to him where I was previously. I get back in the bed and underneath the covers next to Andreas. \"What do I do with this new information?\" I ask him, looking up at the ceiling. \"Whatever you want I suppose.\" He says and I think for a second. \"Can I hold your hand?\" I whisper and he nods. I reach for his hand slowly, my hands shaking slightly. This is the first time I've touched anyone since I was 9 years old. Our hands connect and a tear rolls down my face. His skin. Rough on the bottom and soft on the top--just like in my dreams. All this time I spent in a dark place. All the self loathing. How could you be happy with such abilities that could completely and forever close the eyes of a person...with just one touch. People hated me for something I couldn't control and refused to do. I hated me too. Andreas holds my hand tighter. \"Our scars run deep...but we can't force them to close and push away the trauma that caused them. We try to cover the ugly truth but all it does is bleed through the bandage and look worse. People get disgusted and distracted from their own wounds by looking at others because for once in their life they see a scar that's uglier. Bloodier. Deeper. No one ever says 'cool scar' when it freshly appears.\" He says wiping my tears. Our eyes meet and we stare at one another. The light of the lamp shining and showing me a sight I'm okay with seeing forever. \"What do we do now?\" He asks and I look at the time. \"When do you want to leave?\" I question and he laughs. \"I kinda told my dad I was staying at a friends house.\" He says avoiding my eyes. \"Well then...we dance.\" I say and he whips his head around to look at me. \"Dance?\" He asks and I shake my head 'yes'. I let go of his hand and use the remote to get on YouTube and play Elara's theme song. I mean 'Good 4 U'. I sing the beginning and put on a performance and pull Andreas off the bed when the best drops. We jump around and scream the lyrics of the song. Andreas picks up the hairbrush from my dresser and uses it to sing the bridge. \"Maybe I'm too emotional, but your apathy's like a wound in salt. Maybe I'm too emotional or maybe you never cared at all. Maybe I'm too emotional, your apathy like a wound in salt, maybe I'm too emotional or maybe you never cared at all!\" He sings dropping down to his knees. I join him on the ground and we yell out the chorus of the song. \"LIKE A DAMN SOCIOPATH! IVE LOST MY MIND I SPENT THE NIGHT CRYING ON THE FLOOR IN MY BATHROOM, BUT YOU'RE SO UNAFFECTED, I REALLY DON'T GET, I GUESS, GOOD FOR YOOOOU.\" We yell out huffing and falling out onto the floor. This continued until dad came up and said we had a noise complaint from our neighbor, Ms. Shepherd. We watched movies, debated on which AHS season was really the best, and ended up falling asleep around 4 am. For awhile, I thought that everyone screamed at the dark clouds that cover the sun, for it ruined the perfect day. But maybe...just maybe--some people like the rain. Here are some of the new characters that will appear in the next chapters!

I can almost taste it. French Toast. Mmmm. The sun shines through the window and- wait. The sun is shining! \"School!\" I say sitting up fast. \"The school is closed for cleaning.\" Sea groans. \"Oh\" I say and throw myself backwards onto the pillows and closing my eyes once more. Maybe I'll let sleep take over before I have to go to practice. Wait. I have to go to...\"Practice!\" I say sitting up again. \"All practice was canceled for a week. I'm not sure you can practice without a court.\" Sea groans out again, finally sitting up. \"Right...\" I say, looking at him. His hair is standing up in every direction and little red lines are trailing up his cheek. \"Rise and shine boys! There's breakfast on the table.\" His dad says practically kicking the door in. We make our way downstairs and get seated at the table. \"So, you two have any plans today?\" His dad asks us and we look at each other. \"No sir, we didn't have anything planned out.\" I say back to him and he hums. \"Well, the carnival is tonight. I'm sure you two could find something to do until then if you do decide to go.\" He says drowning his French toast in syrup. \"Do you want to go?\" I whisper to Sea to which he nods in response. Okay we'll go to the carnival, but what do we do until then? Silence falls over the table. Forks scraping plates and sipping from cups. I'm helping Sea wash the dishes when something to do comes to my mind. \"Do you want to go to the Griffin Show?\" I ask and he thinks for a second, washing the dishes slower. \"Sure I'll go, haven't been since dad took me a few years ago.\" He says going back to normal pace. We finish up the dishes and head back upstairs. \"Is it hot outside?\" He asks and I check the weather on my phone. \"Uhh The highest is 55deg.\" I say and looks at me in horror. \"Why is it so damn cold?\" He asks with a pout and I laugh. \"It's October sweet pea\" I say and he glares at me. He goes to one side of his closet and opens it, revealing an array of different colored clothing and shoes. Everything in the closet being color coded. He flips through the clothing and stops on a thick blue collared coat. It has big pockets and buttons on the front. He then picks out a pair of light blue pants, the ones that have the line down the front of the leg. He throws everything on the bed and asks me which shoes I prefer for the outfit. \"The white ones, definitely.\" I say pointing at the shoes. He picks out accessories such as a cross body bag and a pair of sunglasses, throwing them on the bed as well. \"I'm going to go take a quick shower and then we can go to your place.\" He says and I turn my head in confusion. \"Your clothes Andreas.\" He says in a duh tone and I facepalm myself. \"Right, right.\" Is all I say and he leaves the room. What now? I get up and look around his room at the pictures and posters along the walls. Hm. 5sos, Billie Eilish, Troye Sivan, all American rejects. He has good taste in music. I make the bed to waste time, pulling and smoothing the cover perfectly on the bed. I bend down to grab the last pillow that was on the floor and my hand hits something underneath the bed. It's a box. It's a simple converse shoe box. The contents in it holding a little weight. I shouldn't. I truly am curious though. No, let me mind my business. I put the box back where I found it and put the last pillow on top of the bed. Okay now I'll go downstairs and wait for him. I gather my clothes from yesterday and put on my shoes. My shirt falls out of my hand and onto the floor. I bend down and grab the shirt and once again... my hand hits... the box under the bed. Just a quick peek. I open the shoe box a little, looking through the crack and I close it back fast, putting it back under the bed. I didn't know he was into that. I smirk to myself but stop when I hear the door opening. Sea comes in the room with a black robe on, a towel wrapped around his head. \"I'll go wait downstairs.\" I say putting my keys in my pocket. I walk past him and man he smells amazing. I jog down the steps and take a seat on the couch. I turn on the TV and the show 'Bluey' comes up. I sit there transfixed on the couch as Sea comes down the steps. \"You look good. How come you don't wear things like this to school?\" I ask and he looks at me with disgust. \"School doesn't deserve my best clothing.\" He says and walks to the front door. I turn off the TV and follow him out. ~In the car~ The contents from that box are making me feel a little...beside myself...if you know what I mean. Maybe I'll turn on the radio. Yea. I reach for the screen and press 'FM' and I instantly regret it. \"I got no shame. I love the way you're screaming my name.\" Comes through the speakers and I am fast to press the second button. \"I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you, you wanna touch m-.\" Plays throughout the car and I'm freaking out at this point. I press the button with the '3' on it and there's a commercial playing. I sigh out of relief and relax into the seat. \"Are you okay Andreas, you must not like 5sos or the All American Rejects.\" He says and I look at him then back at the road. \"No it's not that, I just--didn't quite want to hear them at the moment.\" I say slowly. He doesn't say anything else and goes back to looking out the window. Everything should be fine now. I focus back onto the road but I just can't shake this feeling. How good he smells. How plump his lips are. How flushed his skin gets while he- I shake my head and grip the steering wheel. We're almost to my house. As soon as I get there I need to take a cold, cold shower. \"Imma care for you. Imma care, for you you you you.\" I look over in horror and try to tap the fourth button on the screen but it's not working. I tap harder and Sea whips his head around to look at me. \"Andreas what's wrong?\" He says looking me over. \"This damn screen sucks I can't change the-\" I make eye contact with Sea at the same time beat to the song drops. I'm awestruck. His pale skin tinted pink. His eyes wide. I want to look at him forever. A horn blows continuously and I come out of my trance and see that I was on the other side of the road and a car was coming our way. Sea holds onto the roof handle and I jerk the wheel to the right, swerving back into the correct lane. My eyes are wide and I'm driving slower, never taking my attention off the road. I reach over and turn the radio off and we ride in silence down the road and into the driveway of my house. I park the car and switch off the engine, looking at Sea. \"Let's act like...that didn't happen.\" I say to him and he nods, his hand still on the handle. \"Agreed.\" We get out the car and walk into the house. \"My parents are at work so you can stay down here if you want or come up to the room.\" I say and he chooses the option of following me. I walk in the room and to my closet. I take out a white hoodie and a dark blue varsity jacket to go on top. I then walk across the room and get a pair of blue cargo pants out of the dresser, with blue and white Air Force ones to match. Stylish. \"I'm gonna go take a shower, don't get napped.\" I say walking into the bathroom. Sea I sit down and admire his room. Black walls, High ceilings, many posters, and of course, trophies. The posters are mainly of r&b artists as well as uhm...men in underwear. Anyway. I look over and see that there's a computer that I didn't notice before. I get up and place myself in front of the desktop, opening the browser. I scream and cover my mouth. Loud noises fill the room and I hurry to turn the sound down. He watches him too?! Who knew he watched stuff like this? I laugh to myself and scroll down the videos. Great taste. I hear the shower cut off and I close the window of the browser and shut the computer off. I run to the bed and plop myself down on top of it. I slouch over, acting like I was on my phone the whole time. Now that I think of it. Tissues next to the computer. It all makes sense. Andreas comes into the room with a towel wrapped around his waist and yea, I don't think I'll ever get tired of this sight. \"Hey, could you wait in the other room for me?It's right there through the bathroom and out the other door.\" He says and I oblige, getting up and walking through the bathroom, to the other room. This room is a bit different from the other. The walls are a deep green with brown trimming. There on the walls were pictures and posters filled with famous athletes, but it still had trophies like Andreas's room. I walk over the wall where the trophies sat. 'Angelo 'Angel' Strong' was at the bottom of a swim trophy. I look down and around the long white shelf of trophies that went around the room. At the end was a section that was clipped out of the news paper. 'Famous Leonis High athlete commits suicide' is in bold across the bottom of a picture. He's holding his arms up in victory, a race ribbon slung around his waist. He resembles Andreas in a way. \"That's my older brother, Angelo.\" Andreas says leaning on the door frame. \"He was a star, he exceeded in absolutely anything he put his mind to. I always looked up to him.\" He says looking around the room. \"Was he a good brother to you?\" I ask and he smiles. \"He was the best. He always took me places with him and showed me how to do stuff. He taught me how to run and move faster, How to fight, He even showed me places to go when I need a break from reality. That's how I know about the waterfall near your house.\" He says and stands up, walking over to a picture of Angelo. \"I just never understood why he did it.\" He whispers staring at the photo. I walk up beside him and timidly rub small circles onto his back. He puts the photo down and looks at me. \"Thank you Sea. We should get going, the show starts at 3 and it's...2:45 already.\" He says. We leave the room and go downstairs, heading out the door. We get in the car and back out the driveway, 'Confidently Lost' plays at a soft hum in the background. I close my eyes listening to the music. \"I am confidently lost, I don't need you to find me. You don't define me. I am confidently lost, I don't need you to find me. 'Cus I'm not hiding, anything.\" They walk into the warehouse, looking around in disgust. \"It's not the best place ever, but I need somewhere to work.\" They say looking around, painting a better picture. Their phone rings. \"Hello?\" they say putting the phone on speaker. \"They let her go.\" The person says over the phone, making the other stop all movements. \"They what?!\" They yell out, echoing through the empty building. \"Good luck dealing with it. Even better that they didn't find anything on the UDS. Don't know how you do it.\" The person says and hangs up the phone. This could be bad. Once her reputation goes down and she finds out what she took wasn't what I promised, everyone will know. I have to take care of this. Andreas \"Look there's one!\" Sea says, pointing to a parking spot. I drive to it but in it's space is a fucking scooter. \"That should be illegal.\" I grumble and keep driving around. After we, finally, find a parking spot, more like stole it from a car that was about to pull in, we get out and walk towards the gates. \"Two tickets please.\" I say with a smile. \"Hey Andreas, you know you're family, go on in.\" Says Chiron. Since he doesn't train anymore, Chiron turned his old training grounds into a place where people could come and watch children of the titans and gods do spectacular things with their abilities. I kneel down to give him a hug and we talk a little. \"How's your dad been?\" He asks and I look around as if I could just spot an answer. \"He's been-- the same.\" I say rubbing the back of my neck. Chiron places a hand on the side of my leg and looks at me in the eyes. \"Remember what I told you Andreas, there's always going to be a place for you here if you need it.\" He says and removes his hand. A sigh leaves his lips and he stares off into the distance. \"Herc always used to do what he thought was right. Things took a turn for the worse after Angelo passed, and he started taking his pain out on you.\" He says. \"I was in pain too.\" I laugh dryly, shaking my head. He takes ahold of me once more in a tight grasp that made me less bitter. We let go and stand back from each other. \"I'm grateful for you guys. I know I could call on you if I was ever in too much trouble.\" I say and look over at Sea. \"Thank you again, I'll see you around.\" I say waving at him and he waves back. \"Alrighty, let's pick a seat.\" I say to Sea. We end up sitting near the top of the arena. Just as we sit down, we feel a rumble from underneath us. Pebbles rattling and falling off of the stone benches. Silence falls over the crowd. All of a sudden the gate to the arena lifts up slowly and out flies this amazing griffin. It soars into the air, turning and doing flips. Screams, claps, and laughter of amazement take over the arena. \"How's everyone feeling today!\" Elia yells into the mic on her cheek, causing more screams to erupt from the crowd. \"That's what I like to hear!\" She says and the griffin comes down, landing next to her. \"Today, I have with me the lovely Yaza, who I have been training with for over two years now!\" She cheers and the crowd claps for them. \"How bout we show them what we can do beautiful.\" She says to Yaza, rubbing behind her ears. Elia carefully mounts Yaza and waves at the crowd. \"By the sound of my voice and a few special words, Yaza will fly, and we'll show you all the new things we can do.\" She says looking over the crowd. She takes off her microphone and throws it to the side. From a distance we see her whisper something to Yaza, causing her to take flight. She twists and turns through the air, passing closely near the crowd. People clap and cheer as Elia and Yaza go higher and higher into the air. Elia stands up on Yaza's back like a surfer on a wave. She punches a fist in the air and goes to get down but looses her footing, falling off. The crowd gasps and goes quiet. Yaza springs into action, doing a nosedive and flying underneath Elia, catching her on her back. Elia punches another celebratory fist to the air and the crowd cheers her on. Yaza comes down to the ground and Elia hops off her back, grabbing her mic. \"Hope everyone enjoyed the show today! You all are welcome to come and take pictures of course and remember, We're here everyday since we live here!\" She says making the crowd laugh. The arena starts to thin out and a line forms for pictures with Elia and Yaza. \"Should we go get a picture?\" I ask Sea and he nods his head. \"My dad is going to get a kick out of this.\" He says getting up and dusting his pants off. After 20 minutes of standing in line, we're next. \"Ah, Andreas Strong in the house.\" Elia says with a smirk and punches me in the stomach. I double over in pain and she laughs loudly. \"Strong, but still not stronger than me!\" She cackles. I stand up again and she wipes tears from her eyes. \"Hey Sea how you been?\" She asks Sea, giving him a hug. \"How'd you know you could touch me?\" He says and she smiles. \"I didn't, was just a feeling, good thing I wasn't wrong.\" She laughs. We all take a picture with Yaza, but not a normal one of course. Elia gets in Yaza's mouth and hangs out dramatically like she's being taken for food. Sea and I fake panic for the picture and pretend to pry her out. People were terrified but I think it came out great. \"Are you coming to the carnival tonight? It should be fun, they have new rides out.\" I say and Elia looks at me with disgust. \"Throw up, food that's either greasy, sweet, or sweet and greasy, and terrible middle schoolers. I think I'll pass.\" She says putting out a bucket of food for Yaza. She's right for the most part of course. Elia leaves Yaza to be with the other Griffins and the three of us leave the arena, going out and seeing the other attractions. Roman, son of Morpheus, preformed his hypnosis over two people from the crowd, turning them into fire benders. The crowd was astonished as the two preformed an Agni Kai, flipping, fighting, and battling it out until one person won. Sea and Elia walk in front of me, laughing and pushing each other while talking about all the recent school drama. I take my phone out my pocket and look at my phone. It's 6:30. \"Elia we'd love to stay, but we have sweet and greasy food to get to.\" I say and she cringes. \"Have fun with that. I haven't been there since I graduated, I never knew why I went in the first place.\" She says and I roll my eyes. \"You just graduated.\" I say, making her stick out her tongue at me like a kid. \"And you're just mad. Anyways, It was nice of you guys to stop by today! I really appreciate it and I'm sure dad was happy to see you Andreas.\" Elia says, wrapping her arms around the both of us. She lets us go and we turn to walk away. \"Have fun you guys! Don't eat the food. Sea call me if you need help with a class! Andreas I'm stronger than you! I miss you alrea-.\" Elia calls after us but her voice fades out when we turn the corner. We get to the nearly empty parking lot where the car is sitting and get in. I turn on the car and blast the heater. \"Are you hungry?\" I say backing the car out the space. \"Very. I saw a Chick-fil-A back the way we came, we can stop there.\" He says and I respond with a 'sounds good' back to him. ~10 minutes in~ \"SOMETIMES I WAKE UP BY THE DOOR! THAT HEART YOU CAUGHT MUST BE WAITING FOR YAAA. EVEN NOW WHEN WERE ALREADY OVER, I CANT HELP MYSELF FROM LOOKING FOR YAAAAAAA!\" Sea and I scream, while pulling into the Chick-fil-A. I pause the music and roll down the window to order. When I finish ordering, I roll up the window and pull around behind a few cars. \"Where were we?\" I say and unpause the music. \"I SET FIRE, TO LORANE!!\" I yell out and Sea stops singing. He turns down the music and looks at me stupidly. \"You set fire to who?\" He says and I blink twice, very confused. \"Lorane?\" I say and he starts laughing. \"Is that not what she's saying?\" I ask him and he laughs even harder. \"What she's saying is literally the name of the song.\" He giggles and I stare at him in shock. \"It...was never lorane? My life is a lie.\" I say, pulling around to the window. \"Here, get your food and stop taunting me.\" I say throwing sauce at him. ~another 10 minutes pass~ \"You know. I don't really think that's true.\" I say and he looks at me with his mouth wide open. \"How could you say something like that, I told you everything I knew!\" He says and I shake my head. \"There isn't going to be a Now you see me 3. That's just how it is.\" I say to him and he turns his body towards the door. \"I get that it's a good movie but the second one was the last one. It's been years! Even if they make another one, which they won't, will it even be as good as the others?\" I question him and he gives me the middle finger. \"Now you see me will always be good. Stop talking to me we aren't friends.\" He says making me laugh. Sea Andreas pulls the car into a grassy area and shuts it off, the carnival entrance to the left of us. I get out and almost instantly hear screaming alongside the smell carnival food. Yay. \"Cassian called and said he's inside with AJ.\" Andreas says and I cringe. \"The know it all nerd with braces and glasses?\" I whine and he laughs. \"Guess you haven't seen him in awhile. Come on.\" He says pulling me. My eyes widen at the sight of the carnival. Colorful flashing lights, screams of fright and joy, but more importantly, everyone's smiling. We make it to the front and pay our 15 dollars each, receiving wristbands. \"There they are!\" Cassian yells, throwing his arms up. Standing beside him is a very tall guy wearing a trench coat. I mean I'm 5'9 and he looks like he'd tower over Andreas, who's 6'2. \"Guys, this is AJ, you probably haven't seen him in awhile, studied abroad.\" Cassian says and AJ waves a gloved hand. My eyes almost pop out my head at the name. That's AJ?! Wow no glasses, perfect smile, tattoos littering his neck. \"You're drooling.\" Andreas cackles and I close my mouth. \"Fuck you.\" I say, punching him in the arm. \"How are you not trying to kill yourself right now?\" Cassian says with wide eyes. I forgot no one else knew about this. \"Sea here, can touch people without his abilities coming forth. They only come out when he wants them to.\" Andreas says hooking an arm around my shoulder. It's quiet between the four of us. \"Well alright! Congratulations buddy.\" Cassian says breaking the silence and slapping my shoulder, AJ shaking my hand with a smile. \"Guys look the 'Alter Ego' is open.\" Andreas says pointing at the tallest ride. Once we get there we all stand in line and make small talk with one another. \"Did you hear about your bestie Elara?\" AJ asks when our laughter dies down. \"Is she doing 5 to 10?\" Cassian asks, glee dripping off of his voice. \"Uhh..no. She was released actually. Now she's telling everyone she was drugged.\" AJ says and we all bust out laughing. \"Drugged?\" Cassian howls, doubled over. \"You have to be a fucking idiot to think people will believe that lie!\" Andreas says, laughing as well. \"Or maybe the person that made the drug was a genius.\" Nina says cutting in line. She flips the line of people behind us off and turns to us with a lazy smile. \"Sorry I'm late, had to take care of a few things.\" She says rubbing a hand through her hair. AJ looks at her like he's not convinced but I guess he decided to leave it alone, turning away and humming a tune. \"Next in line!\" Shouts out the ride operator. \"Nina are you riding with me?\" I ask and she goes to respond but she gets a phone call. She snatches her phone out of her leather jacket and looks at the contact with a grimace. \"I'll catch you on the next one okay?\" She says and walks off. \"Guess you're stuck with me.\" Andreas smirks, making me roll my eyes. \"Only if I get the inside.\" I say and he laughs, stepping up on the platform. \"I wouldn't have it any other way.\" He says holding open the ride door for me. We buckle ourselves in and a bar comes down on top of our laps. The door closes and the ride operator gives a thumbs up before lifting us into the air. The ride stops at the very top so the other set of people could get on. \"If you look out this way, you can see the skyline from here.\" Andreas says pointing through the mesh covering the ride windows. \"Some people would argue that this is romantic.\" I say looking at him with lust in my eyes. We make eye contact and both start laughing instantly. \"Yeah, if getting slapped by cold air, kids screaming bloody murder, and horny people making out everywhere you turn was romantic, then yeah they might as well call this damn the Notebook!\" He says, wiping tears from his eyes. \"Titanic!\" I giggle. \"Fucking Pride and Prejudice!\" He yells and we both howl in laughter. Before we knew it the ride came to an end and we're getting out. Cassian and AJ get out the other side with messy hair and swollen lips. Andreas and I look at each other and break out into another fit of laughter. The five of us spend the night getting on different rides together. We even took pictures in the photo booth, switching out groups of twos every time it flashed. We did it five times so we would all have a unique strip of photos to take home with us. \"See you guys next week!\" I say waving goodbye to Cassian and AJ. Nina left earlier, saying she had to do something important. I would've asked her more about it but I was in the middle of winning a dinosaur. \"See you then.\" Cassian says back, him and AJ waving to us. We make it back to the car and I settle in comfortably, leaning my head against the seatbelt. \"Soo...did you have a good day?\" Andreas asks, pulling out and into the road. \"Yeah it was amazing. For once I felt like my old self...I was so--happy.\" I say with a yawn. I close my eyes and sleep quickly consumes me. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it but it sounded like Andreas said: \"I'll do my best to make sure that your happiness is never temporary. Not ever again.\" But maybe I'm already dreaming. I walk through the halls nervously, looking over my shoulder every few moments, eavesdropping on the chatter about Elara. On her phone were messages between a person over a substance but nothing was ever found in her system and they couldn't track the number. There were also searches in the phone of how to undo pipelines. I smile to myself, no one will believe her if she says anything. Once I get the drugs to more people, they'll take them and be controlled by me. I hold the powers of the whole world in my hands, all from a single pill. I think I'll call it...'The ability'. Nina I get to class and sit down on the far side of the room. I need to lay low today, ripping and running around is not for me. Elara walks in and sits down in the front. Her usual bright persona and flowers to match, aren't there anymore. She looks like she hasn't slept for days. I look away from her when the bell rings, staring out the classroom window. The once luminous clouds now ominous ones, corrupting the pristine portion of the sky. Maybe they're at war. Ripping each other apart, the thunder being the sounds of guns and cannons, the cracks of light being the screams, while the rain...is the blood shed. But who are we to say the dark clouds are the bad ones, just because they fight to be seen in the sky as well. I say it's the sun's fault. Only wanting the dark clouds in hiding because they refuse to be controlled. They don't let the sun be seen- \"Nina?\" Mr. Coeus says getting my attention, making me snap my head away from the window. \"42?\" I say and he looks at me as if I'm brainless. \"This is history class.\" He says shaking his head disapprovingly. \"Does anyone else know the answer?\" He says walking away from me, voice fading out as I zone out again. I need to find someone to help me with this overload of work I'm doing, But who's smart enough to create things as complex as thi- IRIS! *RING* I grab my bag and sling it across my back, running out the classroom and into the hallway. I stare at the AP Trigonometry room door that I see her come out of daily. The door flies open and out comes the tall dark skin beauty that is Iris. I stalk over to her and she starts walking faster. I catch up only just enough. \"You can't avoid me forever Ris.\" I say smugly and she scoffs, \"watch me.\" She says and makes a sharp right turn down another hallway. I run behind her, pushing through people, not bothering to say sorry. I catch up again and grab her arm, pulling her into the bathroom. \"What! Why are you bothering me Nina?\" She says clearly aggravated by my appearance. \"I need your help with something.\" I admit to her with a shy smile. I go on to explain to her what exactly it is I need help with and I end up getting slapped. \"Are you out of your fucking mind!\" She screams and someone walks into the bathroom. We all make eye contact as the girl walks into the bathroom stall. \"I'm not helping you commit a crime dumbass!\" She whisper yells and I grab both of her hands. \"Ris, you're the smartest person I know, The only person that could handle this type of stuff and not fuck it up for the both of us.\" I whisper back to her and she smiles. Then she forces her hands out of mine and slaps me again. \"I refuse to let you ruin my life again!\" She says walking towards the door. \"You didn't say that to Hermes, or should I say our Principal.\" I say taking out an envelope and throwing it on the ground behind her. She pauses at the door and turns around slowly. \"What's that?\" She says, her voice trembling. I smile sweetly. \"How bout we open it together.\" I say and she bends down to pick up the envelope. She opens it and pulls out the photos, looking at them with wide eyes. \"Where did you get them? Did he do this? I'll kill him!\" She yells and I waltz towards her with a smirk. \"I know a few people that can do what I want. How about we make you one of those people? You don't want these pictures out, now do you?\" I ask, whispering in her ear. I snatch the envelope from her grasp and walk to the door. \"You know where I am.\" I say walking out the door. I get down the hallway and Iris runs out the bathroom, \"Nina, wait!\" She said and I turn around. \"I'll do it.\" She says and I grin. \"See you after school.\" I tell her and disappear around the corner. Truth is I've had those pictures for awhile, waiting for the right time to use them against her. Bend her to my will, like always. Perfect. Sea \"Okay okay. Unpopular opinion, Tangled is better than Frozen.\" I say squeezing my eyes closed. I open one eye and see Cassian with his mouth hanging open. \"How could you say that?!\" He says hitting me on the arm. \"Frozen is fucking genius, the music the surprise villain, the ending. It's all a masterpiece!\" He screams, throwing his hands up. \"Yeah it was good...just not as good as Tangled.\" I say and dodge a swing from him. \"You'll regret this. Anyway, Unpopular opinion, Belle and the Beast's relationship was technically beastiality.\" He says and sits back against the bleachers with his hands behind his head. I look over to him with disgust. \"What you guys talking about?\" Andreas says, he and AJ walking over and sitting down below us. \"He just said Beauty and the beast was beastiality!\" I say pointing at Cassian. Andreas tilts his head to the side to think. \"Well, he's not exactly wrong.\" He says and I cover my ears. \"Lalalala I can't hear you. How was practice?\" I ask and AJ slumps down into the bleachers. \"Coach chewed him out today. To be fair, he his defense was terrible. His head wasn't in the game at all.\" Andreas says and stands up. \"You always have tomorrow. You also know your mistakes and you know how to fix them.\" He says to him. \"I'll see you guys tomorrow, I have some training to do. Sea, do you need a ride?\" He asks me and I tell him yes. We all say our goodbyes, Andreas and I walking out the door while Cassian and AJ talk for a bit longer. \"You're training with your dad, aren't you?\" I ask him, already knowing the answer. \"I'll be okay Sea. If things ever got too out of hand, I would leave there immediately and not look behind me.\" He says looking at me. Something says he's unsure but instead of saying anything I nod my head. 10 minutes later The car ride was silent and tense. We pull into the driveway and I grab my stuff, getting out the car. \"I'll call you afterwards, okay?\" Andreas says while the door is still open. \"Yeah...Andreas?\" I say, making eye contact with him, \"Be careful please.\" I say and close the door. I walk to the front door and walk in. I plop down onto the couch next to dad and let out a deep sigh. \"Hard day?\" He says, holding out his beer to me, To which I respectfully decline. \"I just don't like when there's someone that's going through things and you can't help them through it.\" I tell him. He puts his beer down on the coffee table and leans back into the chair. \"Yeah, but sometimes people want to face their own battles. They want to finish through on their own, no matter how bad people want to help them. It's not to push anyone away or be rude it's just...when you do something on your own it's more valuable to you, it makes you happier to have overcome this big thing in your life by yourself, rather than having someone figure it out for you.\" He says and I nod my head. \"I guess I understand.\" I say, grabbing the beer and taking a swig from it. I start coughing immediately and my face twists with disgust. \"Oh yeah, I refilled it with vodka!\" He laughs while patting me on the back. After my near death, dad and I sit and watch Cars 3. I just hope Andreas is okay. Andreas Blue house with white car. Black car, Brick mansion. Yellow house and a green car. White mansion, orange car and two black cars. I run into the driveway of my house after completing my 300 laps around the neighborhood. My dad watches me from the balcony as I carefully strip down out of my many weighted vests and ankle weights. \"3 minutes is a little slow for you, don't you think?\" He says leaning over the balcony with a glass of whiskey in his hand. \"I added more weight today.\" I admit, taking a drink from my water bottle. \"You could add all the weight in the world and you'd still be weak.\" He says laughing and drinking from his cup. I ignore him and start to use the ropes that are lying on the ground. This is kind of therapeutic. I zone out, clearing my mind completely. For 4 minutes I create small steady waves with the ropes, using both hands. I switch to making big waves when the timer hits 5 minutes. I hear something going on but all I can think about is the satisfying sound of the ropes hitting the ground. It's not until I feel a cold liquid being poured on top of my head, that I finally come back to the real world. I drop the ropes and wipe my face, but the liquid had already gotten in my eyes. I yell in pain and frustration while stumbling to look for my water bottle. I get down to my hands and knees to pat around on the ground but I still can't seem to find it. I hear heavy but quick footsteps coming up beside me. \"You think you can just fucking ignore me?\" My father says and kicks me in the side making me fall over. I groan and hug myself, I think I heard one of my ribs crack. He gets on top of me and starts punching me. \"You disrespectful, disappointing, fucking faggot!\" He says and gets up. He kicks at my back and sides many more times before he stands back and unzips his pants. I turn my head knowing what's coming next. \"Since you've been working just so hard I figured you'd need a shower.\" He says letting go of his stream. I lay there and accept it. Not moving, not crying, barely breathing. He finishes and zips his clothes back up, bringing his hand up to smooth his hair back into place. He spits on me and walks away, leaving me to pick myself up off the ground, but I never do. A fresh tear slides down the side of my face. I put my arm over my face as I let out choked sobs. His words play over and over again in my head. Maybe what he says is true. I stand up with a grunt, pain coursing through my body. I feel my way to the door, still not being able to see. I drag myself upstairs carefully and to my bathroom, taking a hot shower. I rinse out my eyes and I'm finally able to see a little more than I was able to before. I grab the soap and start to scrub painfully at my body. When I feel like I've done enough I step into the water. The soap slides away to reveal fresh, tender bruises. More to the collection I guess. I get out the shower and avoid the mirrors, afraid of what I'd see. I grab my phone and lay down seeing that Sea texted me. Deep blue: Hey, call me when you finish up. I tap the call button and put the phone to my ear. It rings for awhile before it finally picks up. \"Hey you.\" Sea says through the phone. \"Hey.\" I say back, looking up at the ceiling. \"How was the training.\" He asks hesitantly. Flashes of what happened come back to me and I can't speak. My eyes burn and my throat has a lump in it. \"It was fine.\" I rasp out, a tear falling down my face and wetting my pillow. \"Oh good! I was worried.\" He says letting out a sigh and a laugh. I turn on my side and cuddle up to one of my pillows to comfort myself. I force out a fake laugh, sniffling at the end. \"Nope nothing to worry about.\" Andreas I wrap my arms around his back and squeeze, trying to pull him closer, trying to be deep within his skin. I carefully control my thrusts the best I can but it's beginning to be too much. His hips spinning circles in my lap, his voice in my ear, our bodies wanting more and more. He stops his movements and grabs my arms, pulling them from around him. He instead guides my hands to his ass and uses them to hold it open. He looks at me with pleading eyes that said more than words ever could. I pull apart his ass more and thrust up until my hips are as close as they can get. Sea wraps his arms around my neck and lets out a whine. \"I know baby, I know.\" I tell him and pull back before going in again just as deep, if not deeper. I can feel his stomach bulge out where my dick sits inside of him. I move my hips in slow needy circles while still inside him, making him become even louder. I pull back again and turn my head to him. We make eye contact and lean in for a slow, tender kiss. My slow thrusts getting faster and harder. He holds his mouth wide open, no longer able to kiss me back. I close my eyes and use my mouth to pepper kisses along his neck and jawline. I feel something wet drip onto my face, but I'm guessing it's just sweat...Until it happens again. Drop upon drop, falls onto my face and roll down my cheek. I stop kissing Sea and look up. I jump away and throw him off of me, he lands on the ground with a thud. What happened to him? His skin a deathly hue of purple, his eyes black. He gets up slowly and starts to crawl over the bed towards me, water pouring out of his widened mouth. I quickly crawl back from him but he grabs my leg and at an instant, my eyes roll back and my thoughts go to my father. He smiles sweetly at me and walks towards me with open arms. I timidly open mine and walk towards him. He pulls me into a warm embrace and doesn't let go. I try to pull away from him but his grip was too strong, I was too weak. \"I lost everything, everything! Why not lose you too.\" He says and ignites us both on fire. I sit up with a scream, my shirt drenched with sweat. I turn my head every direction, in search for Sea or my father, but they never appear. I sigh out and slump back against my headboard. Some nightmare. I get up and trudge my way to the bathroom. I close the door and lock it, turning the lights on. I almost jump back at my appearance. There are lines on my face, my hair is disheveled, eyes blood shot, and my shirt is fully dampened with old sweat. I strip out of my shirt and throw it into the hamper. I walk back to the counter and lean against it, pressing my full weight onto my palms. I touch my forehead to the mirror and close my eyes. \"I absolutely love my life.\" I say sarcastically. \"Access granted.\" A voice says making me jump for the millionth time this morning. I look around for who or what could've said that but I don't see anything different. I was about to call myself crazy and leave the bathroom but I heard a small thud come from the closet. Ah. I wonder which horror film I'm in. I creep slowly towards the closet door and put a hand on the doorknob. I slow my breathing and mentally prepare myself for whatever I'm about to fight off. I step back and flog open the door. I jump into the closet with my fists up, but nothing ever comes. I quickly turn on the light to see nothing in the closet. I look around for what felt like ages trying to find what fell. Finally I see it. A book? I walk over to it and kneel down to pick it up. It's more like a journal. The front and back covers are blank besides a small 'A' carved into the bottom corner of the front cover. So it was Angel's. I open the journal and see his well known, curly handwriting. I move my hand over the words with tears forming in my eyes. The first few pages were normal journal entries saying how his day was and the 'Tea' going on in the school. The next few pages turn into something more than I was able to handle. My face contorts into that of horror and I throw the journal down. All these years of thinking everything in Angel's life was normal and spectacular. I see it now. The limping. The random bruising. The lies and the Medusa tattoo spread across his forearm. I crawl back away from the book and hug my knees to my chest. I slowly rock as I start to hyperventilate. Black spots start to cloud my vision from the lack of air I'm getting. I claw at my neck to try and find some sort of relief but I can't. How could someone do this. How could he do this. A tear falls down my cheek before I completely black out, my back hitting the cabinets. I pull the black knit sweater over my head and grab my things, heading out the door. I breathe in the air outside and look around. Sedona and fire colored leaves hang loosely from the trees as well as litter the pavement. After taking in the beauty that unfolded in front of me, I finally step off the porch and start off towards school, making sure to step on every leaf that lies in my path in the process. Sea \"Good morning class! Today we will discuss your final and I'll pass back your essays from two weeks ago.\" The teacher says, walking back and forth in the front of the room. I glance around and see a few new faces, though no Nina, probably skipping. This is the time of year that people come back and try to raise their grades after skipping for most of the year. The teacher gets to me and places down my essay along with a practice final and walked to the next desk. I press my lips into a thin line and flip over the stapled pieces of paper. Hm...73, not bad. I look through the mistakes listed and circled in red ink until a girl in the front of the room screams. \"Only a 97! My mom will damn kill me. How could that have happened?\" She yells and yells standing up from her seat. She looks familiar..oh yea that's the girl Nina used to have a summer fling with. Now she has flings with the principal...that's life I suppose. I wonder what her name was Eros...ingus...harris..., \"Iris gooding!\" The teacher exclaims with a warning face, making her stop her rant and look at him with an impatient face. That's it! Iris. Before he could say anything someone clears their throat. \"That test is mine and I have yours.\" He says and holds it out to her. She looks down at the paper quickly and a smile makes its way to her face. She turns on her heels and walks over to the paper being held out to her. \"Good looking out kid, someone almost got fired.\" She says looking over to the teacher and sticking up middle fingers. Everything returns back to its peaceful state and the teacher goes over the packet. My mind drifts to Andreas. He called sometime ago and said he wouldn't be around for a few days due to training. I hope he's okay. Iris I hate to treat people terribly, really, but it was for my grade. Can't have bad grades can I? I walk out of first period and on to the next. I turn the corner and I stumble into someone. \"Ah, the myth, the legend, Iris gooding.\" Nina says leaning against the door frame. I roll my eyes and dust my skirt off, pushing past her with a shoulder bump. \"See you at 5!\" She yells from the door and I feel my stomach twist. That's today? This is some big shit she wants me to help with and I can't get in more trouble considering the fact that I'm already fucking the principal. I'd rather go under for this that people know that though. \"Iris gooding.\" The teacher calls out and I turn my head to her. \"Here?\" I question, thinking she's taking the roll but she just shakes her head. \"The Principal wants you in his office, take your things with you.\" She says making my brows furrow. I grab my things and head for the door, walking out of it and down the hall. What does he want now? When I finally make it downstairs to the front office I see Hermes waiting for me. Outside his office. \"Why am i out of class?\" I question him impatiently but he just rolls his eyes and pulls me into his office. See what people don't understand about Hermes is that he's really a great guy and he's only just turned 25 a few days ago. His father ran the school but it was passed down to him when Hermes grew bored of being over it, he figured his son would be a good match for the school considering he was just like him but what he didn't know what his son would fall in love with a 16 year old when he first started this job a year ago. Before you judge me, don't. The bell rings as I'm tucking my shirt back into my skirt and pulling on my coat. Hermes comes up and hugs me from behind. \"You seem upset about something. What's wrong my love?\" He asks me, making me sigh heavily. \"Can I have your advice on something?\" I ask, craning my head to look at him. He turns me around to where I'm facing him and leans down to press his forehead to mine. \"You can always ask me for anything.\" He says and i go quiet for a moment thinking of ways to say this without actually saying it. \"I'm doing something really big soon and I don't know how it will end but what I do know is I'm nervous as hell.\" I say shakily. He rubs my arms and steps back from me. \"Look at me.\" He says making me snap my eyes up at him. \"What you are is amazing, you're the smartest person I know and no matter what happens you will come out on top, every. Single. Time.\" He says and a tear fall down my cheek slowly. He wipes my face with the pad of his thumb and pecks me on the lips. \"Chin up mama. I'll call you later.\" He says turning me around and pushing me out the door with a smack on the butt. Two periods down...five more to go. ~After school~ At the end of the day I met Nina by her car, or her moms car rather, and got in. We sit there for awhile in silence before Nina puts the key in the ignition, but doesn't turn it. Instead she looks at me with a serious face. \"I'm glad you came. I really needed help with this and it was too much for just me. I'll make sure that you don't go down for anything if shit hits the fan. I promise.\" She says and sticks out her pinky to me. At this moment I knew she was serious and not just using me to get what she needed done. Using me and throwing me under the bus. Nina never broke promises, big nor small. I stare at her for a moment, and finally loop her pinky within mine, sealing the promise. I hope this shit goes smoothly. She pulls the car backwards out of its parking spot and out of the school, blasting Pink + White. I stare out the window and turn the outside world into my personal movie as it whips by. Thin and thick trees all carrying similar colored leaves. The world blowing a cool wind throughout said leaves as if they were dandelions. The wish being that everything would fall one day. Just so the world has a moment to relax, before it has to change for everyone while still no one is pleased. No one is ever happy, so why keep spinning, why keep turning, for people that don't deserve me. Why keep spinning? Nina I peak over every once and awhile at Iris. She stares outside the window solemnly, drawing small patterns on the window with her finger. I pull into the warehouse parking lot and shut off the car. I take a deep breath and get out, Iris following. I open the warehouse doors and lock them once Iris steps inside. \"The layout of the plan is over the on the wall and table. Critique it and tell me what to change, this has to be damn near perfect. I only have one other option.\" I tell her making her look back at me skeptically. She eyes over the plans for awhile and turns to me when she gets to the end. \"And you think this will actually work?\" She says eyeing me. \"It has to. I'd hate to resort to the second option.\" I say and she shrugs. \"Where do we start?\" Hi, the photo up top is Principal Hermes. I didn't put him in the new characters because he wouldn't be mentioned often but I figured you should know what most of the characters look like in my head. *The song for this chapter is 'Love of my life' by Harry Styles* Andreas \"L-I-O-N-S, Lions go go go!\" My head is pounding. I look over and see my dad cheering for me and my father, of course, judging my every move. I look down and see my restless reflection through the polished clip of the clipboard. Dark circles and red eyes with pale skin. I throw my towel down and jog to stand where the referee is with the ball. He passes me the ball, to which I throw in to Marcus. I run towards the back while he points to everyone else, giving them signals to pass me the ball. Marcus passes the ball to AJ to which he was supposed to give to me but instead he steps back and goes for a three pointer from the corner. Before he pulls for the three, he looks at me and winks, He thinks he'll make it but he's standing too far in the corner, meaning he'll miss. AJ lets the ball go and everyone jumps in front of him in order to get it. I run through a hole between the players and get ready. The ball flies and hits the rim and bounces off, but I'm already here. I jump up and grab the ball, dunking it past the rim. Screams and cheers sound as I land on the ground and take off towards the other side to defend. 30 seconds left on the clock. The other team passes the ball around us until the clock is at 10 seconds. The other team goes to pass the ball again and I catch their signal. I run through to swipe the ball and break up the pass. I get the ball and see 4 seconds on the clock. Angel flashes through my mind, what happened to him, and who did it. My body heats up with anger and pain. I let it take over me and step back with the ball in one hand, then launch it forward, letting it go. The ball soars through the air and connects with the glass, shattering it, and going into the net with a sharp swish. The buzzes sounds and the lights flicker as people shout and rush the court. I feel slaps and pats on my back as I go to exit the court. \"Good game.\" I say to myself mockingly. I'm almost to the locker room when I hear someone call my name. At first I ignore it and keep walking but they call again, making me whip my head around with aggravation. My face softens when my eyes land on Sea. He jogs over and jumps into my arms. I swing him back and forth and eventually put him down. He clears his throat and scratches the back of his head. \"Hey.\" He says awkwardly making me smile for the first time today. He's so cute. \"Hey, you wanna come over tonight?\" I ask him and he thinks for a second. \"Won't your parents be home? I'm sure you know I'm not too fond of you father.\" He says and I nod, \"Me either. No, they won't be home, they're leaving tonight for some trip with the other Greeks.\" I say and he face palms himself. \"That's right my dad is going to that too. Well, I guess I'll get some clothes and come over.\" He says and I do a small celebratory shimmy. \"Wait here I'll be out soon.\" I tell him and walk into the locker room. While I'm walking in AJ storms past me, bumping my shoulder. I almost turned around but I drop it and keep moving towards the locker room. He's been acting weird but I won't make it a bigger deal than what it might be. Once I'm dressed and out of the locker room, I walk out and up to Sea. \"Ready to go?\" I say to which he says yes and we walk out of the gym and to the car. Or at least we were going to until we were stopped...by my dad. \"My baby, my son, what a great game!\" He says engulfing me into a hug and swinging me around. \"Daaad.\" I groan partly because I couldn't breathe and the other because I know Sea is watching. He places me down and pinches my cheek. \"Who might you be?\" He asks looking down at Sea, making his eyes damn near pop out of his head. I lean down and whisper in his ear that this is dad aka the nice one and not the son of a bitch that's sitting in the car and should be rotting somewhere instead. He stifles his laughter with his hand and clears his throat. \"Hi, My name is Sea, son of Thanatos and Bellona.\" He says and sticks his hand out to my dad. I rub his shoulder with a smile on my face and look at my dad. He seems pleased. \"Very nice to meet you, will your father be joining us tonight, we have been looking forward to getting everyone together for the trip, and it wouldn't be a party without him.\" Dad says after giving Seas hand a firm shake but not letting go. \"Yes sir, he should be leaving soon actually.\" Sea says and Dad smiles, letting his hand go. \"That's wonderful, Andreas what are your plans for tonight son.\" He asks and I rub the back of my head. \"Sea and I were actually going to have a sleepover at the house tonight if that's fine.\" I tell him avoiding eye contact. When nothing is said I turn and look at him. His eyes are looking between me and Sea. \"No bodily fluids on the couches young man.\" He says and I groan again. \"Ok dad, see you next week, love you, bye.\" I shout while pulling away a very flush faced Sea. I practically throw my things in the car and speed off once Sea is comfortable. \"Don't mind my dad. Sometimes he says more that he needs to or should.\"I chuckle. \"I'm just glad he's nice.\" Sea says and relaxes into the seat. Sea lives walking distance from the school so we get to his house rather quickly. We pull into his driveway and he gets out. \"I'll be right back.\" He says and closes the door. I watch him as he jogs up the driveway and to the steps, going in the house. I sit back and reflect on what all happened this week. Practice was pretty harsh, as always. Speed drills and shooting drills on top of working out as well as doing the work that was sent home from school. I painfully read the rest of Angel's journal. That was enough to keep me up every night. My chest hurt and my stomach turning with disgust. I just don't understand. I'll take care of this, I don't care how high and mighty he is, I don't care if he's my grandfather. Tonight however, I get to see Sea. The one thing and person that keeps me afloat in this world. Speaking of Sea, he runs out the house with a small duffel bag draping over his shoulder. He opens the door and plops down in the seat with a huff. \"Ready.\" He says looking at me. I put the car in reverse and back out the driveway, pulling off once in the road. No pov They drive down the dark road together. The only lights on the street being the high beams from the car. They speed down the road, twisting and turning, passing bare trees that reach out upon each other. They don't speak to one another, silently taking in the scenery. Every once and awhile they glance toward each other. Eventually they pull into Andreas's driveway and get out the car. \"I'll never get used to how nice this house is.\" Sea says when they walk inside. Andreas chuckles in response. \"You want to camp out down here tonight?\" Andreas asks Sea, sitting down and sinking into the couch. \"Well since you already made yourself comfortable, I guess we'll stay.\" Sea says laughing and throwing a pillow over to Andreas, to which he let hit him in the face. They pull out most of the snacks from the cabinets and are now searching for a movie. \"Our choices are..Rio, Happy feet Two, or My Policeman.\" Andreas says with the remote in his hand. \"Since when were you the movie choice guy?\" Sea says looking at Andreas with narrow eyes. \"When I picked up the remote.\" Andreas says blowing a kiss. Sea throws another pillow. They end up watching My Policeman, laying their heads on the arms of the couch with their legs tangled together in the middle, not thinking much of it. They watch as Tom touches Patrick. Andreas takes one of his arms from behind his head and gently touches Sea. His finger tips move slowly over the small patch of smooth skin that's exposed at the bottom of his Jean clad legs. Sea notices this but he stays still in fear that if he moves then it'll all go away. All too soon. Something surges throughout Andreas and he sits up. \"What's wrong?\" Sea says sitting up as well and grabbing onto Andreas's shoulder. He looks over to the hand that holds him. Pale, smooth hands that could kill, but choose not to. He grabs Sea's hand and slowly pulls it to his lips. He gives his hand short and sweet kisses, never breaking eye contact. Their hearts are racing and the air is getting thicker with tension. Sea lets go of Andreas's hand to hold both side of his face. They lean into each other slowly until their lips connect. The passion finally being released, the pain of not having it sooner, the excitement of a new feeling and the fear of letting it go. They pull apart and Andreas lifts Sea onto his lap. They continue their kiss. Arms wrapped around each other tightly. Andreas stands up still holding Sea. To which he complained and said he could walk but never got through to Andreas. They walk up the spiral staircase and into the bedroom. Andreas places Sea on the bed and gets in between his legs. \"Toso omorfo\" Andreas says looking over Sea. Arms above his head, his hair slightly disheveled, his long sleeve shirt coming up slightly, revealing the skin underneath, small pants coming past his lips. Andreas leans down and connects his lips to Sea's forehead and from there he travels down, peppering a trail of kisses down Sea's body and telling him how beautiful he is. Sea holds his arms out to Andreas to which he lies in between. \"You don't know how long I've waited to feel this whole again. Waited for someone to see me for what I am and still be okay with who I am.\" Andreas says and lets out a heavy breath. \"What are you?\" Sea asks him. Andreas and Sea make eye contact. \"I'm broken.\" He says in a hushed tone, his voice breaking. Everything that's hurt him and been taken from him is setting in on him all at once. Sea holds Andreas closer, rubbing small circles on his back. \"I believe in you. You've come far and you can go the rest of the way. You'll overcome all your obstacles and end up on top and now you don't have to do it alone.\" Sea says to Andreas who looks up at him with tears slowly sliding down his face. It breaks Sea's heart. \"Are you sure?\" Andreas asks and Sea nods, leaning in and pressing a kiss to Andreas's forehead. Sea wipes away the tears and they lie in silence for awhile. \"Are we going out now?\" Sea asks Andreas and he chuckles. \"I don't know, will you go out with me?\" Andreas says back, smiling. \"You'll do.\" Sea says making them both laugh. The silence falls back over the room and Andreas thinks back to Angel. He has to tell someone about this. \"Sea?\" Andreas questions to which he gets a half sleep 'yeah'. \"I have to tell you something...it's about Angel.\"",

    "text": "Aesclepius and Theseus immediately followed on my heels asking what was wrong. Confusion and panic seeped from their voices and bled with my own. The physician saw Achilles cradled in my arms, or rather he saw the sign that gleamed under his chiton and his expression turned ghastly. \"Carry him. Let's get out of here,\" he ordered. I obeyed him. Theseus directed us to one of the other rooms in his palace. He stayed behind to attend to the commotion that followed. I laid Achilles to the bed. His face twisted in sheer pain and it broke my heart to watch him. Cold beads of sweat formed on his forehead. I called his name again but he won't wake up. \"Undress him,\" the physician instructed. I did as I told. I slid his chiton off him to expose the glowing rune on his chest. Aesclepius drew the curtains close. The rune glowed even brighter in the darkness like ember blown by the wind. He lit a small lamp by the table and it cast light on the face of the physician. The dread that I saw previously looked even more grim as shadows flitted menacingly on his face. Achilles gasped and clawed on his chest as if the rune was smoldering its way through him. The physician opened one of pouches on his belt and pulled what looked like a leather holder. Inside were rows after rows of pins and needles. He drew a vial with transparent liquid and dipped one of the needles about a finger long in it. \"What are you going to do?\" \"Buy us time.\" He stabbed the needle right through the center of the rune until its entire length buried itself inside him, pressed down by his thumb. Achilles shuddered. The ember glowed brightly once more then dimmed. I jolted at the shock of having to watch all of it but soon after, the pain looked like it subsided and Achilles stopped clawing agonizingly at his chest. However, he remained unconscious. Pain furrowed his forehead. Momentary relief shot through me, however, whatever was hammering loudly in my chest since the moment I realized something was wrong with him would not let up at all. \"Just what is--\" \"That's the unfinished Glyph of Tartarus,\" the physician answered, pointing at the rune on his chest. Tartarus. Again. Numbness coursed through my body. I couldn't speak. Aesclepius sat on the chair adjacent to us, as I was kneeling down by the side of the bed, grasping Achilles hand in mine. The physician studied me silently and said slowly, \"It's also known as the Unraveling Curse.\" Finally, I found my courage and my voice and asked, \"What is unraveling?\" The physician looked like he thought twice before answering, \"His soul.\" The ground felt hollow under my feet, as if a chasm that has always been there but I didn't notice before suddenly opened up and swallowed me in. I gripped on Achilles' hand tighter. I can still touch him, I muttered. He's here. He's still here, and I'll chase him to the ends of Tartarus if I have to. I breathed in and the lump of dread grazed my ribcage. It hurt to speak. It hurt to think. I swallowed, trying to find voice from my dry throat. Aesclepius started pacing the room, lost in thought. The Glyph of Tartarus bore the semblance of a sundial at first glance except that once you looked at it closely, some things were strangely different. In place of the numerals to tell the time were characters from a possibly unknown alphabet. Unlike a sundial, it didn't have a gnomon or an indicator protruding from its center but it still cast a moving shadow around the glyph, like an invisible finger, marching and pointing at the inscrutable characters around the edge. The glyph looked like it was supposed to be a circle except that a sliver was missing from it, like a pie with a slice taken away. The shadow cast by an invisible gnomon ticked away on the glyph, a dark-streaked finger moving across the gleaming ember rhythmically and consistently, as if it was counting the seconds before it moves, as if it was counting time itself. \"What exactly is this curse? This is so sudden. He's fine all this time.\" \"It is not sudden and if he has it now, then he has it for a long time. He was never fine. He might not have just felt it because this curse, among other things, is highly insidious. It's the kind that you'll never notice until it's...\" he paused, chewed his words and spit them out, \"until it's late.\" \"No, it is not late. It is not. Tell me about this curse.\" \"It is a rare disease of the soul. It is so rare that it largely goes undiagnosed. Not every physician knows about it. To be honest, unless you're seeing it first hand, the Unraveling Curse is closer to a myth than to a disease. Only the dead can have it and you can only get it from Tartarus. Souls bound to Tartarus have a natural immunity against it. In other words, only souls from Asphodel and Elysium are vulnerable to it. And even if that's the case, it's nearly impossible to contract it from a whiff of Tartarus. You have to stay there long enough to get it.\" Aesclepius grew increasingly impatient as he explained, \"Just how would he have it? It's not contagious either. Elysian heroes don't make a habit of going to Tartarus and staying there--\" The physician saw my face. He understood. \"Why would he...? No one does that. That's madness.\" \"He went mad,\" a voice said. It was Theseus leaning by the doorway. He entered the room and looked at Achilles on the bed. The sight of the curse did not seem to surprise him but his expression remained dark. \"The doors of Tartarus are forbidding,\" argued Aesclepius. \"Aeacus, one of the Judges and the Doorkeeper of Hades, holds the key. You don't just walk in there for fun, curiosity, or madness!\" \"He stole the keys,\" replied Theseus. The physician shook his head, unconvinced, \"Theseus, even Heracles himself wouldn't able to rob Aeacus of the keys. Not because Aeacus is strong enough to overpower him but because the keys themselves will not allow anyone to open those doors except their master. Not to mention that Zeus himself was said to have hidden those keys underneath a water forest who only allows entry to those born of the flesh of water nymph--in honor of the nymph he fell in love with, Aegina, mother of Aeacus.\" Theseus exhaustedly threw himself on one of the chairs adjacent the bed. \"Doctor, the keys do not have one master. The Doorkeepers of Hades are the Aeacidae, the House of Aeacus. It only seems like the keys heed to only one doorkeeper, Aeacus, because unlike his sons, he alone was born of a water nymph and therefore was the only one allowed entry in the watery hiding place of the keys,\" Theseus paused and stared at the unconscious Achilles, his fingers locked under his chin. It felt like an icicle dropped on my back. I gripped even tighter on Achilles' hand that grew colder by the second. \"That man, Achilles, is born of the nymph Thetis,\" Theseus said, \"and he's a grandson of Aeacus.\" \"What did you just...\" \"The keys recognized that he was descended from Aeacus and since he was born of a water nymph, he found where the keys were and they opened the doors of Tartarus for him. Achilles can use the keys of the Underworld, just like his grandfather.\" Silence hang heavily in the air. Aesclepius paced the room again, more agitated than before. \"And he wasn't aware of any of that,\" Theseus said again. \"How come he didn't know his own line?\" \"Ugh, Aeacus banished his sons alright?\" Theseus scratched his head. \"Peleus and Telamon. Wasn't a pretty story. But that wasn't the point. Achilles knew there were keys, and he knew he needed them to enter Tartarus, and he was determined to steal them, not knowing that of anyone who will attempt to do that, he is uniquely allowed to take it.\" \"And of anyone who is uniquely allowed to take it, it must be an Elysium-bound soul who went mad and stayed in Tartarus long enough to contract the curse.\" \"Just tell me what does this curse do,\" I said. \"It unravels the soul. The unfinished Glyph of Tartarus. It's a timer, a countdown. What I did earlier was slow down the shadow hand but it's impossible to stop it completely. As long as that hand is moving, the glyph is being carved to the soul. There's only a sliver left before it's completed.\" My head was buzzing. I strained myself to listen to him. \"And what happens when it's completed?\" \"When a soul is unraveled, it will be as if it never existed.\" My hands that were holding Achilles also felt cold and numb. \"What do you mean by as if he never existed?\" \"He will be gone from the memories of everyone who remembers him. He will disappear from the words of poets who immortalized him. The Trojan War would be fought by a different warrior who would kill Hector. The nymph who bore him would have a different son and the title of Aristos Achaion would fall on that son. The stories of Achilles would live on but the stories would live on without him. It would be someone else who will fill his role. And you, Philtatos, would love someone who is not him, and no one would even know it happened. No one would even know he happened. No one. Not even you. He would be gone but he would not be missed. It would be as if he never stepped on the sands of time because the traces of the life he lived will be erased from it. It's a cruel curse.\" It took me apart. My own soul grew heavy and cold in my bones. \"No...no...no, that's impossible. There's no way that's--no way, that's just impossible. No way. He's dead. We're dead. Souls are the only ones that survive. These are lies.\" \"Souls are made of the thread that Clotho spun. Before anyone is born or have their fate drawn out for them, Clotho first spun them to existence. Lachesis cast their lot, and then they were born according to their fate. This thread continues to be woven until Atropos cut it and it's what survives in the end, the thread that Clotho spun. The curse unravels what survives.\" \"How come we don't know anyone who had been--\" I stopped myself. Of course we don't know. Whoever they were, those whose souls had been unraveled, their stories, their lives, we will never know. We do not remember what we do not know, and we do not miss what we do not remember. It is really a cruel curse. \"That's why I said unless you're seeing it first hand, the unraveling curse might as well be a myth to anyone who will hear it.\" \"Please tell me you can save him.\" Aesclepius remained silent before muttering, \"I can't.\" \"You can raise the dead!\" I screamed. Tears welled up from my eyes. \"Unlike the death of the flesh, the death of the soul cannot be mended.\" \"No, please, please, I'm begging you,\" I wept. The physician said nothing. Grief tore through me. I rose up and grabbed the Cloak of Alizarine. \"Where are you going? Where do you think it will take you?\" Theseus called, grabbing my arm. \"Hopefully to Aeacus himself. If not, Hades. Or Rhadamanthus. Whoever I can ask to take me to him.\" \"And what are you planning?\" \"Ask him to open the doors of Tartarus for me.\" \"And what? Get the curse yourself?\" the king read my mind. \"Have you gone mad?\" \"WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO BE BECOME?\" I yelled and shook his hand off me. \"Have I gone mad? 'Have I gone mad' you asked? I HAVE! If his soul unravels, then mine might as well do the same. If someone else would fill in the stories he once lived, then I don't want to be in it. I don't want to spend the rest of time in an eternity that doesn't even know him!\" Tears flow on my cheeks as my heart breaks once more in a million pieces. And this time there's no picking them up. This time there's no piecing them back. Because this time there's no point. \"Weren't you happy? In that time you spent together, weren't you happy? Wasn't that enough?\" \"If I have known about this from the start, do you think I would have been--\" Then finally it dawned on me, \"Don't tell me, you--have you known about this all along?\" He did not respond. \"Answer me!\" He breathed heavily and sat down once again, \"We have an idea but we don't know exactly what it is. We first saw the glyph when we picked him up after he was whipped in Tartarus. Back then it was only about a quarter completed. It disappeared within the day so we thought nothing of it. The second time it appeared was when he returned after gouging both of his eyes out. The second time lasted for weeks. During both of those times he never fully fell unconscious like this but the pain was debilitating enough that he would pass out every now and then. We thought it might have been a countdown of some sort because the glyph during that time has progressed to more than half completed. Hades doesn't know about the curse but he can tell.\" \"What?\" \"That his soul is coming undone. The god of the dead has known that the Underworld is about to lose Achilles' soul.\" I cradled my head in my hands. The dull ringing in my ears intensified to a shrill. It cut through my temples and it was all I could do to resist the urge to crack my head open to stop it. \"And you didn't tell me.\" \"The god of dead did the best he could do,\" Aesclepius said. \"Or would you rather be miserable with the remaining time you have left together?\" The old centaur's words echoed in my head. Do not let what you gained this day be so easily lost. I have given up a lot in my life. My family. My home. My future. My name. But right here, right now, lying on this bed is all I have. I will not let anyone have him. Not his mother. Not his fate. Not this curse. \"I refuse,\" I knelt to his side, held his hand and kissed it. \"If the greatest physician who ever lived cannot save him then I will. If the god of the dead has given up on him, then I haven't.\" \"You won't even grieve over him after the curse is completed,\" Aesclepius said, arms crossed. \"Because you will not remember. You will continue to live in bliss after he's gone. However, one misstep can change all of that to eternal damnation. Why risk it?\" I looked at him dead in the eye and said, \"Because I'm a man about to lose my everything. There's nothing I wouldn't risk.\" He stared back at me silently. The wordless air hang heavily between us and I breathed it in. Finally, he broke his gaze and tossed his head back, whimpering. \"It's so much easier to raise the dead than this. It's just smuggling Hades' subjects out of his realm,\" he griped. \"Alright. As a physician, and as much as it humiliates me to admit, I cannot treat him. But if you must seek divine wisdom, then you can go ask him. He can give you answers that even the gods cannot.\" \"Who?\" \"Tiresias, the blind seer.\" Another seer. Prophecies had never treated us well. \"I don't think I have to warn you, but prophecies do not have a reputation of helping those who wanted to be saved.\" \"We learned that the hard way.\" \"Regardless, they provide uncanny insights about the future that the present wouldn't be able to conceive. There's nothing you wouldn't risk, isn't that right?\" I gazed down at Achilles, ran my fingers through his hair now damp with sweat. Aesclepius and Theseus left the room. \"You're right,\" I called. Theseus paused by the doorway. \"It wasn't enough. We were happy but it wasn't enough. And if it is my fate to be remembered as that fool whose greed led to his damnation, then let it be remembered that he did so unable to let go of the only thing he refused to give up.\" \"I will remember,\" he answered and left. I called Achilles' name over and over but he did not respond. I remembered our days in Elysian Pelion where I did not even need to raise my voice to call him. He would hear his name in a whisper so long as I called it. I pressed our foreheads together, called his name once more before muttering, \"I'll get you back.\" I picked up Hades' cloak. There was a waiting room attached to this bedroom and there I found Aesclepius and Theseus sitting by the table. Heracles was also with them, a deep wound on his chest. It no longer looked threatening but guilt tugged on me nevertheless. \"I'll buy all the time that I can so do what you need to do,\" said Aesclepius. \"Just come back,\" Heracles muttered, stern and curt. \"If he wakes up and you're not here...\" \"I know.\" I looked at Theseus who nodded silently at me. I draped the cloak around my shoulders and the ground felt soft under my feet. I was no longer in Theseus' Athens. *** When I looked up, gone were the lamps that lined the walls of Theseus' anteroom and the dusk streaming in from the narrow slits of the curtained window. Instead, an empty cavernous darkness loomed over me, an infinite stretch of night, a bold absence of anything. I looked down and yet I can see the path gleamed under my feet, the still muddiness of earth soaked in the cold dim light of the moon that was not hanging above. For the moon was not above, the moon has sunk underneath the water, partially blotted out by the trees and reeds that gave this swamp its eerie glow. It was curious, I thought. The pockmarked face told me that it was indeed the moon but it told me nothing about what it was doing there. To say 'there' was also curious for I also knew nothing about 'here', wherever 'here' is, except that 'here' feels familiar. I have felt this brooding darkness before, the way it held its secrets and kept them close. I looked terrible, I thought as I saw my reflection on the water. I dropped on one knee. My eyes were sunken and swollen. I already looked like mourning. It was eerily silent, or so I believe it was. The ringing in my ears seemed to drown out everything else, even the loudest silence. There were also flashes. White-hot headaches that traced themselves across my skull like lightning. Ever since Achilles collapsed in my arms, this high-pitched ringing has never stopped. I shut my eyes tight, forcing it out of my ears. It worked like my prayers to the gods. It did nothing. I opened my eyes again and there was someone--or something--staring and smiling malevolently at me from under the water. I felt my blood curdled deep in my bones as white and bony hands shot up from the swamp and locked their fingers around my head, their nails dug on my skull as they dragged me down. I seized those wrists and wrestled with them. It had rows of jagged teeth, whatever 'it' was, that snapped at me and I narrowly avoided having a chunk of my face bitten off. Then suddenly, 'it' started singing. The song was soothing and calm that it almost lulled me to stupor. Almost. I clawed on those hands that were seizing my head even tighter and with all the strength I could muster, I wrenched their hold on me until I was able to yank myself free. I fell on my back and 'it' scurried back into the swamp in a shriek of protest. \"That was impressive.\" I turned around in surprise. My body felt deathly cold. It was one thing to look at that thing face to face. It was another to have escaped from it. \"You were not pulled in.\" A young woman with a wicker basket has been standing a few steps behind me. She looked like she saw all of it and wasn't exactly a stranger to a scene like that. I stood up and said, \"I'm looking for the blind seer.\" \"That was a Stygian siren, you know.\" Stygian. I see now. This is why this place looked familiar. I am in the Stygian marshes. \"I see,\" I shrugged. \"Would you know if there's someone else residing here? Like someone who is blind and also a seer.\" \"There's supposed to be no one who can resist their song. They're peak temptress. Infamous seducers of men.\" With looks like that? I thought but did not voice it out. \"Well, they are supposed to look irresistible to you once you hear their song,\" she said, reading my mind. \"I'm looking for Tiresias.\" \"I know,\" she replied. \"So how did you do it?\" I gave up and indulged her, \"I couldn't hear it over the sound of my anxiety.\" \"That's unfortunate. If you can look past the fact that their song will sink you to oblivion, it is music.\" I clicked my tongue. It was his laughter that is music and I won't hear it again if I dawdle here. The woman stubbornly kept on, \"In fact there was a famous hero who wanted to listen to it so much that he asked to be tied to the mast of a ship so he won't be pulled in.\" \"If he wanted it so much, he should have just drowned in it.\" She looked at me quizzically before saying, \"But that's dangerous.\" \"Is it? If you found your home in the most treacherous depths, there is nothing much worse than to be left on the shores.\" \"Your home is in somewhere that dangerous?\" \"No. It's my home who makes the somewhere dangerous.\" \"Well, he can't because he had a wife to come home to.\" \"Is that so?\" \"More than that I'm impressed you managed to pull yourself free out of sheer will. I was about to bring a rope.\" \"With respect to his wife, some of us can afford better men,\" I said, \"Now, if can you point me to the direction of Tiresias I would be greatly thankful.\" \"Up,\" I followed her finger and there was indeed a hut on top of a small hill. She showed the way and I trailed after her. It was a short but muddy hike. Each step was toe-deep. She didn't seem to mind. In fact she looked so used to it that she wasn't even wearing sandals. It grew darker as we went up since we were getting further from the swamp with its sunken moon. \"Don't you have any light?\" I asked, wondering how she knew where she was going in this darkness. \"Ah, oh, hold on,\" she produced a lamp and lit it, as if she simply forgot and not because she didn't need it. \"Aren't you going to ask?\" \"Is it far? I don't have a lot of time.\" \"About the moon I mean. What is it doing there? Do you know whose it was?\" \"Not Artemis?\" \"No. It's the chariot of the Titan goddess of the moon Selene. It's her only chariot.\" Finally, we reached the hut. It was crude. Despite that, it seemed to have everything it needed. There was a rough kitchen, a tucked mattress by the wall, and an equally rough vegetable patch on the yard. It all seemed incomprehensible to me how they grew in this gloom and darkness. It was even more incomprehensible to me how she fared in all of this. She put her lamp down and fumbled at her own gates. It was curious. You should cast the light on your gates and not on your feet. I picked her lamp and pointed it to where her hands were. She said thank you even if she didn't look like she really used the help. \"Selene crashed it there and lost it forever,\" she said again. \"She did so in order to light someone's way out even if that meant she will lose her meaning as a god. She did it for a mortal.\" Maybe if it's someone like her, my prayers would actually work. \"She stopped being a god. Artemis took over that role,\" she replied, as if she divined what I just thought. \"I don't need a god. I would worship anyone and anything who can save him,\" I scanned the hut and found no one else in it, \"I'm going to ask one last time. Do you know where Tiresias is?\" \"Yes I do,\" she looked at me with eyes that reminded me of Achilles. \"And you come to me for advice.\" \"I am Tiresias, the blind seer,\" she said again at my quiet disbelief. \"I thought you're an old man.\" \"I am that too. I just went with this,\" she twirled around, \"It's nice when you have options.\" My quiet disbelief turned to a quiet confusion. \"Before I was blind and before I was a seer, I was first a woman. In fact, my becoming blind and a seer were uncanny consequences of me becoming a woman, which was in turn a consequence of, in equal proportions: curiosity, fear, and ignorance.\" Our stories spoke of the prophet Tiresias as a man of few words. I'm beginning to think that the Cloak of Alizarine might have finally broken down on me. \"But that doesn't explain why--\" \"It does explain everything Philtatos. Do you know that male snakes have spiked double penises? I didn't know that at the time when I chanced on a mating ball of snakes. It was a matter of curiosity at first except that they were having this steamy little tryst in the shed of some elderly woman living alone. I feared that they would make a nest there so as much as I understood that no one really appreciates being interrupted in the middle of it, I had to drive them away. Things went out of hand and I accidentally killed one of the female snakes.\" Tiresias was well-renowned as a seer who is incapable of being wrong. He was also well-renowned for being terse to the point of ambiguity. I don't know about the first part, but the latter part, I'm having doubts. \"Who would have thought that the gods were given to such voyeuristic proclivities that it was an offense to have interrupted that. I was turned to a woman as a punishment. I tried it for seven years. I even gave birth.\" \"And that made you a seer?\" \"No, but it made me qualified to settle the debate among the gods as to who experience more pleasure during intercourse, men or women, as someone who has been on both sides of the bed,\" she continued. \"To say women is to offend Hera. To say men is to offend Zeus.\" \"So you offended Hera.\" \"And I was struck blind. Zeus, on the other hand, gave me the gift of prophecy.\" \"But that doesn't explain why are you still a woman now.\" \"Oh that's only because those things down there seduce every man that comes. It's better if I stay like this.\" She looked at me briefly, turned around, and picked up a piece--or rather what looked like two pieces of shawl. She seemed to be in the middle of patching them together as there were two knitting needles at their seams and a ball of yarn trailing by the floor. One of them was more worn-out than the other but the color and the pattern of the two pieces looked like they were cut out of the same material. It did not look too odd to weave them together. \"Oh excuse my little art project,\" she said, as her hands began to work on the needles, loop after loop, the yarn went. \"I used to have a closet of epiblema but now I don't know where they all went. They often get snagged here and there that the yarn would come loose. Sometimes I would be too late to notice the frayed ends that I almost lost half of the material.\" It was almost hypnotizing to watch her deft fingers moved through the loops and knots. \"So, do you want to ask me what the future holds for you?\" \"No. I don't need to know a future I don't want to be in. I'm here to ask how to save Achilles' soul from the Glyph of Tartarus.\" She continued knitting for a while before finally asking, \"What did the doctor say?\" \"That he cannot cure him.\" \"How about the gods?\" \"That it is inevitable.\" \"Then what is the point of trying to stop it?\" \"Even so, I refused to give in to the inevitable.\" \"And you come to me?\" \"I find my hope where I can. Even from the depths of hell.\" \"How about the poets?\" \"What?\" \"What did the poets say?\" she glanced at me. \"If the doctor and the gods cannot help you, how about the poets?\" \"But what did the poets--\" He is half of my soul, as the poets say. \"Want to test that?\" she looked up from her work, as if divining the words that crossed my mind. \"No, no, that's just poetry. How could it--\" \"Exactly, isn't it? It's just poetry. At its best, poetry is only a glorified account of a past that didn't exist. At its worst, it is a reminiscence of an unremembered truth that dares not speak itself out loud.\" She studied my confusion before continuing, \"A long time ago, in a story older than the gods, it was once said that humans used to be double-beings, bearing one soul in two bodies. This 'oneness', a constitution of being whole and complete, the lack of want for anything else, a state of absolute satisfaction that defies the need for the deities, made humans powerful enough to rival the gods themselves. Zeus feared these humans. He feared that they would usurp power from the gods. Therefore, he cast a curse that separated the humans between themselves, halving their power as a result. From then on, humans will only inhabit their one body with their soul split in two. It was said that the part of their soul where the tear was made ached so much that humans couldn't do anything else but writhe agonizingly from their lost. Apollo took pity on them and sew these half souls on the seams where the wound was made. The navel was the remnant of where Apollo tied the knot. It was also the remnant of this ancient curse.\" \"And what happened to them? Their other half?\" \"You yearn for it. From then on, humans learned desire. The constant hunger for something more has never left them. Whether it's riches, glory, or fame. All in the hopes of filling the void their other half left. But they never work. Nothing truly ever did. This perennial state of dissatisfaction, the want of the coveted unknown, the search for what makes them human, whole, and complete made them vulnerable--and vulnerability seeks the gods.\" The ringing in my ears grew louder by the second. The white-hot shrill arced across my skull. I shut my eyes tight for a second. \"Humans can never find their other half again. Not when they're alive. Not even when they're dead. To do so is a feat greater than miracles,\" she continued. \"The other half of your soul. It's lost. Like one grain of sand washed by the sea. Humans subconsciously knew this, and have long settled with the nearest best substitute they can find, inventing ceremonies, rituals, contracts to bind themselves with, trying to become one with them, hoping to feel whole and complete again. And even on that impossible chance you find your true half back to you, you won't know for sure. You have long been numb from the ache.\" I, for one, certainly don't feel numb from it. I pound the base of my skull, \"And how does all of this talk going to save the only soul that I care about?\" She smiled, \"If he is really half of your soul, as the poets say, then the only thing that can save him from falling apart is your own soul.\" \"He can have it. What do I need to do?\" She seemed briefly surprised before shaking her head, \"No, not like that. Apollo did quite a good job sewing the seams but the Unravelling Curse is more powerful than that. It tugs on the loose ends created by Zeus' ancient curse. To stop it, you have to close the loose ends. In other words, you have to bind the two halves back. If you want a chance at saving Achilles' soul, you have to reverse the curse of the king of gods.\" \"And how do I do that?\" \"Don't you have fear?\" \"On what?\" \"You are risking to offend Zeus, the king of gods, for attempting to reverse his curse.\" I breathed in, \"I stand to lose Achilles, what else can I fear more? If Zeus will punish me with eternal grief in Tartarus then I'd rather have that than spend an eternal bliss not knowing him. So let me ask again, how do I do it?\" \"All of this out of a mere chance of saving him?\" \"I'll take it.\" \"I understand,\" despite the darkness, her eyes seemed to darken even more. \"You are not the one who can do it. However, it will be up to you if he will.\" \"Who?\" \"There's only one god who can reverse Zeus' ancient curse, Hades, ruler of the dead, god of souls.\" I unfolded the cloak on my hands, \"I need to know. What happens to him if the poets are wrong?\" \"You mean if your souls do not belong to the same whole?\" \"Yes.\" \"How about you? Are you only going to ask what happens to him?\" \"At this point, I can't really care about anyone else. So just tell me what happens to him.\" \"No mortal knows,\" she answered. \"Because that's the kind of mistake Hades wouldn't risk to make. And he would not risk it because one: gods cannot reverse the exact same curse of each other's. That was why even Zeus cannot reverse my blindness that Hera cursed me with. And two: because of what will happen should he agree to help you.\" My face turned white, \"What?\" \"Should he agree to help you, under the rage of Achilles, Hades will fall.\" I froze where I stood. Then she said next, \"And I don't mean the god.\" When I was alive, the realm of the dead was rarely ever called the Underworld. The name for the realm of the dead is synonymous to the name of the god who rules it, Hades. Therefore, should Hades agree to help me, the Underworld will fall. But why Achilles, why would he? \"But why--\" \"Prophecies beg no reason, Philtatos.\" I swallowed the words in my throat. Confused, I fumbled to don the Cloak of Alizarine once more. \"One last thing,\" she called, now engrossed at her knitting. \"It's not always the fastest route that brings you where you need to be. If you find yourself in a garden, then walk through it. It might be slow, but it is not wrong.\" No one really knows how to go to the palace of Hades and arrive. This is partially owing to the fact that no one really knows the direction to go there and wholly owing to the fact that the god is not keen about uninvited guests, especially if the guests are grumbling souls of the dead who are inclined to express their dissatisfaction in a rather dramatic fashion. Like, for example, by diverting one of the rivers of the Underworld. Being much of a god as the rest of the pantheon, Hades would not shy away from doling out consequences as any other god would. Except that with death, illnesses, and misfortune already out of the table, what with the dead having been there and done that, there were not just much to work with and to come up with something else equally effective would require more work than it's worth. This is why the god would rather avoid audience except for those he provided means to do so i.e. Theseus' Lamp of Skiamati or the Cloak of Alizarine. However, Achilles once swore that it is quite rather possible to brute force your way to finding Hades' palace if you trace any of the five rivers of the Underworld to its source. Although, if Theseus was to be believed, that was only because Achilles cleared all the monsters that met him along the way that the naiads in the rivers simply could not stand the bloody trail he was leaving so they voluntarily led the course of the river back to the palace. With Hades' palatial estate not being a common destination in the Underworld, it took me a while to realize what I was looking at when I arrived. I was at the foot of a cliff and on top stood what looked like the god's palace. A winding trail carved itself at the side of the cliff opening up to a dense forest and a muddy track. The lush colorful shrubs and vegetation surrounded it. I surveyed the face of the cliff and thought that while it might be difficult to scale, it was quicker and straightforward. Meanwhile, I'm not sure where the rambling trail would lead me. I grabbed a foothold and began climbing. Living in Mount Pelion, I have become used to scaling cliff faces such as this. A strong gust of wind beat my face, carrying leaves, petals and traces of varied floral scents. The scent of a garden. Rather than the verdant scent of lush green foliage. If you find yourself in a garden, then walk through it. I hesitated, then remembered. Tiresias is a prophet who is never wrong. I retraced my ascent, descended the cliff and headed to the trail. True enough, I found a beautiful garden in the middle of it. In fact, to call it beautiful is a gross understatement. I have never seen a field of flowers quite anything like this. There were blue, white, and red anemone and hyacinths, blue, purple, pink and white aster and bellflowers, pastel crocus, sweet pink carnations and peonies, bluish white delphinium, and white lotus and water lilies languidly drifting along the ripples on a pond. The garden showed off its colors as if it did not belong in the shadowy glum of the Underworld. In the middle of it stood a tree with flamboyant red flowers. Some of it have not blossomed and remained as red buds, while others have completely grown fruits, which I found strange. Usually the entire tree follows the same season but it seems that on this one, each flower follows a different season. As if the entire tree is on spring, summer, autumn, and winter all at once. It is a pomegranate tree. \"Oh? I haven't heard of a visitor coming today.\" It was the voice of woman. She had a wreath of flowers on her head and a cart in her hands, which she was pushing in front of her. In that cart were various garden tools such as sickle, scythe, rake, spade, shears and empty buckets. She might be one of Hades' maids who were taking care of this beautiful garden. \"Excuse me. I was just passing--er, no, I'm here for an audience with the god of the dead.\" \"I see. This way then,\" she led me and I cast one final glance at the tree. \"Strange isn't it? As if the flowers don't agree among themselves whether to bloom or not.\" \"Why?\" \"Because it's not up to them.\" She studied me for a while before continuing, \"This tree is a receptacle of memories. It takes its nourishment from the memories of anyone who will touch it. The fuller someone's memories are, the more vibrant and flamboyant the flower becomes.\" As if to show an example, she picked a stem with a red bud. The moment her fingers touched its stem, the bud blossomed, spreading its delicate red petals in full bloom. She smelled it briefly, smiled, and returned it to the branch she picked it from. It magically grafted itself back to the tree. \"See? It is grown from someone's memories. So long as there is someone who remembers, the flower will never wither. So long as someone remembers, the flower will never forget. It is as eternal as the afterlife. The flower will continue to bloom or bear fruit in a beautiful reminiscence of the memories it blossomed from.\" My throat felt dry. If I touch them, will they remember Achilles? Will they also bloom in a beautiful reminder of him? Or will they also wither miserably in the absence of him? \"These are mostly grown from the memories of the souls from the Fields of Asphodel,\" she said. \"A lot of souls condemned to forget have memories they don't want to lose. After all, not everybody can be allowed to wander in their afterlife with their memories intact. However, for those without a choice, this is the least we can do for them. Whenever they see how beautiful the flower has blossomed from their memories, the more they can let it go. They peacefully leave behind memories of their lives knowing that someone out there, in the land of the living or the dead, remembers the stories they once lived. And that is enough for them.\" But Achilles will not even have that. There will be no one left to remember him. I stared at the tree, grown from the memories of the dead who once lived. It is unfair, I thought. This is unfair. I pinched my eyes between my thumb and index finger, I don't know, maybe because I have been struggling not to bawl my eyes out. \"Then what happens to a flower that holds memories no one no longer remembers?\" She paused and looked at me, \"It disappears.\" I clawed at my head. I don't know if it was the heat behind my eyes or the buzzing in my skull that did it but I felt tears rolled down my cheeks. I wiped them right away. I'm running out of time. \"Young man, you look utterly terrible.\" \"I'm about to lose someone very important to me and I would need the help of Hades to save him. But I don't know if the god would even consider it.\" \"Don't worry. You have my word that he will help you.\" She smiled, and it was like the breath of spring, a breath of hope. *** The lady accompanied me to an underground walkway where we emerged to the throne room. The familiar, dark cloaked figure who gave me Achilles' three-hundred year receipt came into view. Hades was not happy to see me. \"I knew one day you'll come to me about this. Theseus should have already told you.\" \"He did.\" \"Then--\" \"I had been to Tiresias.\" The god paused, and a disgruntled look, \"That physician again is it?\" He addressed my wariness pensively, \"So? What did the blind prophet say?\" \"That I only have one chance of saving him but I would need your help.\" \"I thought Theseus already told you. There's nothing I can do to stop the Unraveling Curse.\" I felt my hands clenched to a fist. I couldn't bring my eyes to look at the god. \"There is. But the prophet said,\" my voice strained. I don't want to say it. If he refused after he learned of it then I might as well have lost Achilles. \"What did he say?\" The lady from the garden was still with us. She was standing behind me and she was still wearing the same smile she had. I found myself disclosing the prophecy, \"Tiresias also said that should you help me, the Underworld will fall under the rage of Achilles.\" Silence fell. After a while, I heard the god sigh. He sat down on his throne, hand under his chin, he addressed me. \"No matter what Tiresias prophesized, I never intended to listen to you at all, Patroclus, much more help you. You and Achilles have caused me enough work in the last past years than I ever had in my eternal reign as the ruler of the dead,\" his eyes slid past me and shifted to the lady behind me, then back at me. \"But I will listen to you, see what I can do.\" I looked up at him, \"You'll help me?\" \"I'll have you know that personally, I wouldn't even want to listen to this. However, you have my wife's word and I shall honor it.\" Wife, he said. Wife! As if hit by a bolt out of the blue, I turned around and looked at the lady behind me. \"Sweet isn't he?\" Persephone beamed at me. *** \"Good for you isn't it?\" the goddess of spring said next. \"That you came by the garden. If you walked straight to the castle's gates, he wouldn't even let you in the throne room.\" \"My queen,\" I dropped on my knee. \"That was rude of me. Please forgive me for not recognizing you. I am--\" \"Achilles' most beloved,\" she said. \"Yes, I know. We all do. Rise up. I always wanted to meet you too. However, not like this. As an Elysian resident, you look far more horrible than the criminals in Phlegethon.\" \"I thought I have already told you before that a curse from Tartarus never heals,\" Hades said. \"It bows to no god and exalts no divinity. So what did the prophet advise you that I can do?\" Tiresias' words played in my head. Because that's the kind of mistake Hades wouldn't risk to make. I steeled myself and looked at the god in the eyes, \"Reverse Zeus' ancient curse and let each half of our souls become one.\" The effect was immediate. I could almost hear Persephone stifle a gasp from behind me. Hades froze then frowned, as if he couldn't stand the temerity I asked it with. But at the same time, he understood. They understood. How undoing Zeus' old curse might save Achilles' unravelling soul. \"Madness! This is madness!\" he stood up from his throne. He was having none of this. \"And how would you know? How would you know if you are really half of his soul? The other half that Zeus has torn off since then? No one has been able to tell. No one! How many do you think have thought that they found it only to realize later on that they were wrong all this time? Finding half of your soul is like searching for a specific ripple from the sea. You can't just tell. What makes you think you're any different? And no, you don't tell me it's love. Young man, the truth is you can love anyone else just as fine even if your souls don't belong to each other.\" He's right. Of course he is. Even I don't labor under the delusion that just because I love him, it will be enough to save him. I have damn well loved him when we were alive but all it ever did for him was watch miserably as he fell apart from his fate. \"I have never once thought I'm any different. You ask me how would I know. I don't. But love is for children, Hades. And I'm done believing it can save anyone. It's too kind to do something as reckless as that. I desire him as a man, you understand. It is not pretty and certainly not noble. I ache for him with a desire that even if it burns Hell itself, I'd rather watch it turn to ashes than stop.\" \"But I don't! And you dare say that in front of me? The ruler of Hell itself?\" \"I know but I do. I want him as the Greeks wanted for Troy to fall. I want him as the soldiers wanted to rape their women. I want him as the gods wanted to watch and do nothing about it.\" Hades glared at me so fiercely it singed my skin. I sank on my knees in front of his throne and I clasped both of his knees, an act of supplication. I glanced up at him with all the reverence I could muster. \"I'm begging you.\" The god hissed testily. Supplicants are usually protected by Zeus which makes any king, mortal or god, wary of their response. Except on a case like this where the supplication goes against its own protector, Zeus himself. Hades was not looking impressed. He rose up from his throne and shook me off. \"Why?\" I asked, still kneeling. \"So gods cannot really reverse the curse of other gods?\" \"It's less of that reason,\" Persephone said, arms crossed. \"It's not like he can't. If the two of you are still alive, then he can't. The gods cannot reverse curses under the exact same circumstances the curse was given. But since the two of you are already dead, it can be attempted. Zeus also has less power over the dead than the living.\" The god looked at his wife as if to ask why was she trying to help me. She only smiled at him in return, a source of cheer in an otherwise glum throne room. \"Then why? I'm begging you, please.\" \"Do you even know what happens if you're wrong? If I bind two half souls that never once belonged to each other?\" \"I don't.\" \"You will stop being human.\" I stared at him silently. \"Half souls that never belonged to the same whole are vastly, vastly, different, something one cannot recklessly graft to each other at will. If you do, the stronger between the two half-souls will feed on the other, consuming it, filling itself with what it is lacking. It is not conscious, merely a consequence of binding half souls that are never equal, nature seeking to balance itself, until one of them loses their soul completely.\" Hades continued, \"Once you lose your soul, predated, you will cease to be human. You will be resurrected as an abomination, a monster of flesh without a soul, to roam and lay waste on the land of the living and the dead. A monster that is far worse than any of the heroes ever fought and killed.\" \"How about Achilles? What would happen to him?\" \"Achilles, with the blood of the gods running in his veins, being descended from Aeacus and born of Thetis, will persist. Between the two of you, his soul is more likely the one who will remain.\" \"How about the Unraveling Curse? Will it disappear?\" \"I don't know. No one has ever done this before.\" \"But there's a chance. No matter how slim it is.\" \"Why? Why risk it? You understand how bad the odds are. But why won't you get it? You will become another monster! Another force to reckon with! A monster far worse than those born of Typhon and Echidna! Far worse than the Hydra or Chimera! Than Scylla and Charybdis! If humans back when they were double-beings have the power to rival the gods themselves, then humans bound to the wrong half are just equally disastrous!\" I stood up from kneeling down. \"So you're saying that if this goes wrong, I will become a monster.\" Hades glared. I smiled, \"Then let him be the hero in whose hands I die.\" \"I'm the god of souls, ruler of the dead. Do you think I will simply allow a monster to be born from a ghost who lost its soul? Do you think I will defile a soul this way?\" \"It's my soul.\" \"No, no, no I can't. That's transgression against dominion, the greatest taboo a god can commit. A crime against myself. It's the line I will not cross.\" \"The Stone of Rhadamanthus.\" \"What of it?\" \"I see that you went to great lengths to hide the scars he got from Tartarus, or the fact that he lost his eyes. You also scrambled to have Daedalus fix him an artificial heel so he would not be permanently crippled after he cut up his heel over a stupid bet in River Styx. Why bother?\" \"What are you trying to say?\" \"Why hide it? It's not like Achilles mind if the rest of the Elysian residents know what he did. Or perhaps you don't want them to know?\" I probed further, \"You don't, do you? You feared that everyone would find out that the Isles of the Blest is not entirely the paradisial perfection it promises itself to be. That it is quite rather possible for someone in Elysium to spend the rest of their afterlife miserable and wanting. And that wouldn't be good, would it? The gods above reward and punish, and mortals live and die based on the promises of the afterlife they earned. Wouldn't it all fall apart if suddenly they learned that all of it is not completely true? That the promises of the afterlife can fail? \"Gods have never been truly reliable but mortals remained to devote their lives to them because they fear the consequences after they died. And they fear it because it all seemed immutable to them. It all felt fixed. The unyielding will of the Heavens, the retribution of Hell. But suddenly, there are exemptions. I wonder how both the gods above and the mortals devoted to them would feel about that. \"If it gets known that the Underworld's Elysium can host misery and discontent, its Asphodel home to spared souls who never forgot, and the doors of Tartarus can be breached, wouldn't it speak ill to the one who rules over it?\" \"I see,\" Hades sneered. \"And you're saying you will let them know?\" \"I really would rather not.\" \"And you think they would believe you?\" \"I don't need them to believe me, I only need them to doubt you. Isn't faith the one thing gods need from humans?\" \"Are you threatening me?\" \"I already begged and it did not work.\" \"The glyph of Tartarus is a ticking clock. Achilles does not have long enough left. You know that all I need to do is detain you and wait until his time is up. After which you won't even know he ever existed.\" A knot in my heart twisted tighter. I breathed deeply. I brandished the Cloak of Alizarine. It was subtle but Hades' mouth twitched, as if galled to see me unfurl the cloak he gave me in front of him. \"Detain me where?\" I asked. \"If that's where I needed to be, then I'll gladly be your prisoner. But if it isn't, then I don't think I would be staying there much longer.\" \"This is all very plucky of you, Patroclus,\" Persephone said, coming forward to face me. \"I have had enough of anyone and anything taking him away from me. I lost him once to his mother. I lost him again to a prophecy. But not this time. Not to a curse like this. This time I want to be the one who gets him. This time I want to be the one who wins.\" \"And if you fail?\" \"Then I will fail trying.\" She said nothing, or rather she seemed lost in thought. I waited some more but she kept quiet. Finally, it was Hades who spoke next. \"You're a changed man, Patroclus.\" I scoffed, \"I'm dead. What else can I change into?\" \"I actually heard a prophecy about you. One before you arrived here. A prophecy from one of the seven, Amphiaraus, who said that long enough you will become someone the rest of the Underworld will need to be wary of.\" I shrugged, \"Because of what Achilles can do when it comes to me? Then you just need to be wary of him, not me.\" \"That's true if prophecies are only as honest as the first thing you think about them.\" \"That's it!\" the goddess exclaimed, \"Are you sure Tiresias really told you to bind your souls together? Was that really how he said it?\" I thought for a while, \"No. She didn't say it that way. She merely posed it as a test. If the poets are right.\" \"She?\" it was Hades. \"Poets?\" this time it was Persephone. \"Tiresias was a woman when I saw her. 'He is half of my soul, as the poets say.' She wanted to test that.\" \"Test,\" Persephone mumbled, \"Test. Oh! That's the one. Then let's test you Patroclus. If you do pass it, then my dear husband here will reverse Zeus' curse on you two.\" \"Hold on, calm down,\" Hades muttered. \"What test is this?\" Persephone looked at me instead, with a question. \"How good can you swim?\" *** The answer to that is good enough that I won't sink like a rock should I need to swim. However, judging to where I was brought in, I would probably need more than just 'good enough'. \"This is?\" I asked, knowing exactly what this is. \"The River Lethe.\" Which is not that. \"Kataraktes. It's waterfalls. It's anything but waterfalls. Plunge waterfalls dropping from a knife edge cliff.\" \"Yes, and that's the waters of River Lethe falling from it.\" \"I've never heard of any of the rivers of the Underworld falling from such an impressive precipice.\" \"That's because we never have one until Achilles arrived and diverted Cocytus.\" I kept a straight face. Or at least tried to. \"This cliff here is one of the dozens that were created because of that. Not to mention the maze of gorges downstream.\" I peered over the frothing mass of water underneath, churning in a sunken pit amidst the darkness that made it look as if it was boiling. There were no lush or any vegetation, no flora or fauna unlike the waterfalls back in the land of the living. There was just the exposed face of the cliff, the gleaming white waters that rushed from it, and the rest is hidden in darkness. I glanced up and as expected there was no sky to see but unexpectedly, there was something bright above. Glowing stalactites. Iridescent minerals that continued to drip, forming a blanket of conical lighting in this cave. \"In other places, the river barely trickles. While those that fall from high altitudes are reduced to fine mist before even reaching the bottom.\" I looked to the owner of the voice beside me. She couldn't look more translucent even if she tried. \"Now, you're trying to do something worse than that.\" It only occurred to me that she was actually speaking to me. She was dangling her feet over the ledge where we stood overlooking the waterfalls. She looked up at me. \"You will doom us all.\" Under the rage of Achilles, Hades will fall, the prophecy said. \"I'm sorry.\" \"But you will do it anyway?\" \"Yes.\" \"Lethe!\" Persephone greeted her. \"My queen,\" she stood up in courtesy. \"We found an opportunity to test your suspicion about the cursed half-souls of Zeus.\" \"I really didn't wish to find that out with the Underworld at stake, my Lady.\" \"What suspicion?\" \"That my power might not work on the memories shared with your true half,\" the river god said. \"Before Apollo stitched the seams where their souls had been ripped apart, Zeus ordered the humans to swim my waters to alleviate the pain. After all, what you cannot remember cannot hurt you.\" \"Swim? Not drink?\" \"It's more potent to swim through it. As I'm sure you'd know, there are those who drink its waters and end up not completely forgetting.\" \"What happened to the humans who swam?\" \"What do you think? If it had been so successful, Apollo wouldn't have to sew them up.\" \"So they remembered?\" \"They did not forget the feeling of having lost a part of them,\" Lethe answered, miffed. \"That doesn't happen. Shouldn't happen.\" Hades said, \"Sometimes a soul whose punishment involves drinking from Lethe has strong attachment to their memories that they end up remembering them later on.\" He gestured at the turbulent waters, \"When that happens, we usher them for a swim in Lethe so they can completely forget.\" I peered again at the seething, roiling currents, \"And they come back up from that?\" \"They don't,\" Lethe answered simply before continuing, \"I have naiads who bring them up. The dead can no longer drown to death. Even so it doesn't make navigating it easier.\" I turned at Persephone, \"So how do I do this test?\" She smiled. Hades clicked his tongue. The goddess was holding a tray. On that tray was a branch with a lone pomegranate flower bud from the tree in her garden. She gestured me to pick it up. It bloomed under my touch, coyly unfurling its lacy ruffled petals that glistened with the low light of the cave. \"As you may have already gleaned, you will have to swim the waters of Lethe,\" Persephone wrapped her fingers around the flower I grew. When she unwrapped them, it returned as a flower bud. \"I said 'swim', but there's really no finish line to it. You just need to turn up in one of the banks. Once you do, you will have to grow this flower again. If it blooms, then it means you have kept your memories with you. Then my husband here will bind your souls together in exchange of passing the test.\" Lethe guided me to a protruding outcrop near the curtain of waters. I looked down and immediately knew that this is something I wouldn't survive if I ever attempted it back when I was alive. I braced myself for the jump. \"Or you can give this up now, keep him in your memories for a little while longer and spare the rest of us,\" Hades said grimly. \"You already realized, don't you? I kept quiet, aware of Hades' eyes on me. \"The meaning of the prophecy. The future that has been staring at you since the beginning. You're just refusing to look at it. The rage of Achilles. The fall of the Underworld. The future where you will forget about him after this. The future where you will stop being human and be resurrected as an abomination. How it would enrage him, and how Hell would fall in consequence of that. The Unraveling Curse may be gnawing its way on his soul right now and frankly, the curse might be the only way to stop him but that doesn't make him less dangerous. His own death sentence after killing Hector did not stop him from slaughtering all those that came after him.\" \"And if I don't forget?\" I asked. Hades turned at me and held my eyes with a glare, calm and sinister, \"And what makes you think you'll never forget?\" What makes me think I'll never forget? I stared back at him, each word from my throat rushing in reply. I would know him by touch alone, by smell. I would know him blind, in madness, in death. By the way his voice echoed in my bones, by the scars on his back, by the glint on his eyes, by the shrill in his laughter. I would even know him by his absence, by the hollowness it leaves in my soul. Without his memories, I'm neither dead nor alive and worse off than the damned. But I swallowed them all and replied just as simply as he had asked. \"Because I can't help it.\" I dove to the frothing pool underneath. I might have just imagined it but the cave seemed to have shuddered right after I jumped. It didn't take long for both the dark and the cold to sink their teeth in my skin as the waters took me in. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! (See the end of the chapter for more notes.) One of the benefits of being dead is that you have long been far removed from a very fragile and vulnerable flesh that was home to your soul your entire life. One of the disadvantages of being dead is that you have long been far removed from a flesh that while very fragile and vulnerable is at least fragile and vulnerable enough to elicit caution and responsible use from the soul to which it was home to. These two, of course, are not mutually exclusive and thus given to inhabit the same curve. Achilles is simply ahead in that curve. I immediately understood what Lethe meant by 'having the naiads brought them up'. All the swirling and unpredictable currents beneath the surface have caused whirlpools to form. I instinctively gasped for breath before remembering I didn't have to. I desperately swam away from the falls and propelled myself to where the waters flowed slower. I am determined to avoid being sucked in any of the whirlpools, keep myself in the middle lane. After quite a while, I was able to find my head above water. I sought where the nearest bank was, flailing my arms and kicking my legs to keep myself afloat. A seeming endless night stretched before and behind me. It was dim and my eyes strained to see. I made a quick inventory of my memories. I can still remember why I am here and who it is all for. I am soaked enough and I have drunk enough of its waters when I took the plunge earlier. I am not sure how does the River Lethe make one forget their memories and I don't intend to linger long enough to find out. After scanning through the gradients of darkness, I managed to pick out a slice of dim stillness in it. I decided it was the bank or somewhere near it and steered myself towards it. As far as first instincts go, it immediately failed me and I headed straight to the edge of an eddy, a pool that sucked me in promptly. I caught myself in a panic and mustered all the strength from my limbs to climb over it only to get dragged deeper and deeper until the water grew dimmer and dimmer, as if arms suddenly erupted from the riverbed and were pulling me down, the meager light from above unable to penetrate these depths. To be honest, if I needed air to breathe, I have long fainted and drowned. But this time it wasn't the lack of air that was to be blamed. The water felt heavy, too heavy as if the entire weight of it were on my shoulders sinking me down further, compounded by the white-hot sharp headache that has been screaming in my skull all this time, wielding a hot blade that sliced through the meat in it with full ease. It throbbed gently at first, a finger tap on a wooden table, then wildly the next, a battering ram across the gates. Until finally it gave way. Something. I don't know. Like a string that has finally snapped. A latch that has been opened. Then I was gone. When I opened my eyes again, I was shocked to find myself underwater. I instinctively held my breath. It was bright and hot. The sun was a scorching chariot high and still on the sky. The water was clear and warm. And salty. Very salty. Like the sea. I swam upwards, wanting to rise above the surface to breathe but there was no such thing as above. It was water all the way up. I could see the horizon outside of the waters every time I gazed upwards but I couldn't seem to get anywhere near it. 'Have you no more memories?' the water whispered. Or perhaps it wasn't the water that whispered it. Perhaps it was a voice in my head. Or a piece of the past that has fallen of. I shook my head, as if that would make all of the jagged pieces fall off and show me a picture, the picture. It felt incredibly important. It felt maddeningly urgent. 'I am made of memories', the water whispered back. Another piece fell. 'Go. He waits for you.' I woke up again and the warm and bright waters were replaced by something appallingly cold and dark. There was no sun above. The water was a liquefied wall that not even light can pass through. And it tastes nothing. I was drifting right at the lip of a whirlpool, close enough to be drowned in but far enough to avoid myself from getting caught in it. I swam frantically, the currents propelling favorably on my direction, as if it suddenly decided to help me, bringing me back to safety, to land. I heaved myself up to the banks, drenched, every inch of me freezing. The only thing that was piercingly hot was the sharp stabbing pain in my temples. So deliriously scalding my brain feels like a boiling mush in my skull. The picture. The picture the jagged pieces are meant to form. I reached out to the pieces. Somewhere. Tucked in there in the fleshy folds of my brain. Except that the more I try to think it should be there, the more it scorches, as if razing everything down to the last piece. Except for one final piece. The piece that refuses to burn. And it is a name. The name is Achilles. \"Achilles,\" I muttered to myself. It felt strangely familiar and strangely foreign. \"Achilles. Achilles,\" I repeated, as if the name knows how well it rolls down my tongue. It was all I could remember. It was all I have. But it felt like it was everything. Was that my name? No. It didn't feel that way to me. It felt more endearing than that. A moment later, I was no longer alone. Two women. One man. All of them not looking like they were mortals. Divine beings. Gods and goddesses. They were frowning and definitely not happy. They were silently studying me, as if waiting for me to speak first. One of the goddess stooped to present me a branch with a lone pomegranate flower bud, motioning me to take it. I was so confused that I didn't even bother to ask why. I held it between my fingers. They were looking at it expectantly. But nothing happened. Her face turned grim and worried. The god clicked his tongue and spun on his heels, turning his back at us. He mumbled some words as if issuing orders to the lingering shadows. One of the goddesses who was wearing a translucent white tunic snorted. I steadied myself in an effort to stand up. Every inch of me was numb from the cold and weighed down by my clothes. It felt heavier than it should be which seemed ironic to the searing emptiness I was feeling. As if I dropped something in the water. I looked back longingly at it, on the waves that rise and fall, dull in some places and surging in others. \"I have sent the seven to guard all the gates,\" the god said. \"Truthfully, we should more than be able to fend him off. But the prophecy has been spoken and no matter what, it has to come to pass.\" Then he turned to one of the goddesses, \"You my dear will leave and go back to Olympus. Tell Zeus that you know nothing.\" \"No.\" \"Please.\" \"I'm the Queen of the Underworld and if it falls, then I shall fall with it.\" The ground shook violently, sending huge waves to crash to the banks, threatening to collapse the cave and bury us underneath. A man appeared from the shadows, light flickering on his face from the lamp he was holding. He glanced at me and I stared back at him blankly. He looked ragged as if he went through a lot just to find his way here. \"He's here,\" he told the god. The god sighed. I want to know what's wrong. What's happening. Why do they all look that everything is ending? But at the same time I am afraid to ask, for whatever it is, it seemed I had a lot to do with it. Part of the cave had collapsed. Chunks of rocks fell in the water. A ray of light peeked in from the outside. The cracks branched out further like webs until a bigger section gave way. Something--or rather, someone limped from the hole on the wall that was punched opened, oblivious from the stones that have been falling on him. Bloodlust lurked in those eyes, darting around the cave like a lion in search of its prey. His gaze fell on me. And I met those eyes. There he was, his frame silhouetted against the light, and his eyes. Oh. Gleaming pools of emeralds, scandalously beautiful at the merest touch of light. I shuddered at the sight of it. He hobbled at my direction slowly at first, as if he couldn't believe it. Relief soaked his face. Then he began dashing towards me, limping and dragging his heel behind him. It was bleeding but it did not slow him down at all. He threw his arms around me and tackled me to the ground. We fell together, one pair of arms securely wrapped on the other, and another pair of arms flailing on air, confused on where to put themselves. There was another man that came after him and he looked equally battered, a huge bandage rolled around his chest. He was inscrutably studying me, as if waiting for me to do something. Whatever it was. \"Patroclus! Patroclus!\" the man who tackled me to the ground sobbed. He was clasping something on his chest. Something glowing. It looked appallingly painful, as if it has been burning its way through him. A circular rune of malevolent crimson. Except that the circle has not yet fully closed itself, two lines about to touch. Ouch. I sucked air through my teeth. Inside my head was a hiss. Like something had just fizzled out. I flinched so hard. Something wants to form itself back but it keeps melting. Like ice on a furnace. \"Patroclus, why?\" He saw where we were--or rather the river that I just came from. He looked around and he saw the goddess in a translucent chiton. Horror flushed on his face, sheer maddening horror. His eyelids fluttered hesitatingly, the words dry in his throat. When they came, it was dreadful and hoarse, \"Lethe? Why are you...? This is...this is...\" He turned to me again, tears flowing on those cheeks. \"No, no, no, no,\" he wept and wept and wept as realization struck him. My heart gave way with it. \"Please, please. Don't...Don't forget me. No, no, please.\" I thought: there is nothing I'd rather remember than this man. \"I am still here! I am still here Patroclus! So please, please,\" he was crying in my arms. \"Not yet. Don't give up on me just yet.\" And then: I'd rather see Hell burn than give up on you. Oh I see. It's his name. He is the picture all along. \"Achilles.\" The moment I said his name this time, all the pieces fell into place. The scorching puddle of incomprehension has been doused. The fire that has been razing its way in my memories flickered into a wisp. My hands remembered where to put themselves and they put themselves on his face, cupping them, wiping the tears off those cheeks. Of course it's you. It has been you all along. I pulled him close, then leaned and kissed his forehead. \"Oh. Finally,\" I chuckled softly. \"Now I can wipe these tears off for you.\" I held up the branch of the pomegranate flower bud in my hand and watched its petals unwrap themselves in their fluttering beautiful reds, slowly and gracefully, as if it knew it had an audience to mesmerize. Persephone gasped. The others looked at it exhaustively decided that this shouldn't be happening. When it has bloomed completely, I kissed it and I tucked it on Achilles' ear. \"Yep, charming as anything,\" I smiled. I looked up at Hades, \"I passed. You will honor your wife's word, won't you?\" Silence whistled in the cave. \"Please.\" Achilles was confused. He had a face that was asking what was this promise. \"It's done,\" the god finally said. \"That's it?\" \"Yes. Your souls are bound. The ancient curse of the king of gods has been lifted.\" \"You sure we don't need to stand on ceremony for this?\" Hades sighed. He has been sighing a lot since I met him, but this time he dragged it longer than usual. \"Pieces that fit together just fall into place. As it should be. It stands on no ceremonies and makes no noise.\" \"So what? Have we got it right? Oh gods. I swear in my father's name, this is spectacular. What are the odds?\" Persephone was genuinely amazed. \"Have we? Are the two of them really?\" \"Seems like it,\" Hades replied, observing me. His terseness was inscrutable. \"Oh hold on, there is a way to check isn't it? Apollo's knot. Is it there? Look, quick, is it there?\" Achilles furrowed his brow, wrinkling his handsome face, \"What knot?\" I pulled on the neckline of his chiton and peered down on his midriff, wonderfully chiseled as always. I checked mine as well. We have both lost our navels. We have both lost the remnant of Zeus' ancient curse. 5 Chapters without Achilles. The dark, dark times. In fact after Hades said 'It's done', four things began to happen at once that my own brain fumbled about what to notice first. One: The glowing rune on Achilles' chest has disappeared. Two: My left heel began bleeding, accompanied by a dull throbbing. Three: My back felt itchy and slightly painful. Four: And oh, my left eye seemed to have lost its sight. Which now makes me half-blind. Might have been one of the negative side effects of Hades' curse reversal. I did not fuss about it. After all, it wasn't like I asked Hades for a full disclosure of the consequences. I decided to keep mum about it. At least for now. Achilles would not be happy to learn about it. Except that it didn't seem it would be willing to wait that long. Achilles fumbled on my face, brushing his fingers on every inch of my skin, staring at me intently. He seemed like he has been seeing me for the first time in forever--which he is. \"Oh, oh!\" he yelled in disbelief. \"I can see you Patroclus. I can see! It's only on my left eye though. But I can see!\" I looked at his eyes. One emerald. The other was the color of warm chestnut. I see. I smiled to myself. That's how it worked. \"Then you can finally stare all you want,\" I said, sounding casual about it. I don't want him to know for now. I don't want to see him beating himself over it again. \"What was it? What have you done? Why was I cured? I thought the curse of Tartarus is etched on the soul?\" \"Uh, oh. I asked Tiresias about--\" \"It was never cured,\" Hades interrupted. \"No, wait. Please let me--\" \"You just shared it with him,\" the god mercilessly plowed on. \"You did not gain your own sight back. That's his eye you're seeing with. Patroclus has become half-blind.\" \"What? What?\" he sought me for an answer \"Is that true?\" Oh dear. \"Come on, Patroclus! Is that true?\" \"It's not only that.\" \"Hades, please. Let me.\" \"Half of the scars on your back is now seared on him. The heel you broke on River Styx has also broken his.\" I watched as Achilles' face fell in shock and agony as he scanned me from head to toe. \"Your soul is no longer in danger of unraveling, Achilles. As it is now bound to its half. No loose threads to tug on. However, it also means that anything your soul has incurred, whether it is a blessing or a curse will now be shared to the other. That is how it is. You understand?\" I sighed. To be honest, it was no big deal to me. I was planning to ease him into it--I mean, if I was given the chance to. \"No! Why does he have to--those were things I did! I should be the only one who should suffer for it.\" \"LISTEN UP BRAT!\" Hades' voice boomed in the cave. We all flinched and were reminded that he is a god, brother of Zeus, one of the rulers of the three realms. Few more rocks were dislodged from the crevices due to the shock. Achilles, laudably and silently, held the god's furious gaze. \"Would you cut it out already? You should be thankful he's only getting away with an eye, some scars, and a heel! He was prepared to lose much, much worse!\" Uh-oh. He really, really didn't have to tell him that. \"Worse? What could be worse? What were you trying to do?\" he looked at me for answer. Hades sighed again, fingers on his temples. \"Do that somewhere,\" he said, shooing us away. \"If only I could exile souls, seriously I would. I wouldn't even mind if that too-talented-for-his-own-good son of Apollo smuggle you back to the land of the living.\" \"Well, I am most profoundly flattered, my lord,\" another man with long red hair tied in a ponytail and a huge scar on his chest appeared just behind Heracles. \"But we both know that it is impossible for those whose flesh have long returned to dust. Sadly even talents such as mine are not enough to alter the inevitable.\" He then regarded me, \"Thankfully you have something more than that. Well, I'm glad you didn't meekly listen to us when we told you to give up, Patroclus.\" It was a little validating to hear him say that. It has just begun to sink in to me that I actually succeeded. I won this time. This time I'm the one who gets him. \"Yes. I heard all about your little advice on visiting Tiresias,\" Hades shot back at Aesclepius. \"My lord, I'm a doctor. When we can no longer save the sick, the only thing we can do is send them to someone else who might.\" \"Why are you here?\" \"You wound me. I'm on the lookout for collateral damages,\" he raised a wooden box. \"Also, I'm glad I will actually be able to affix this pair of artificial heel that I asked Daedalus to make on the off chance this little gamble succeeds.\" \"You mean the 'little' gamble that put the entire Underworld at stake?\" Aesclepius chuckled innocently, \"To say the 'entire Underworld' is too much of an exaggeration, isn't it? Not even a single blade of grass from Asphodel has been touched.\" We blinked blankly at him. He blinked back equally blankly at us. Finally Heracles offered, \"Apart from the castle, everywhere else is fine.\" *** It turned out there was a tower on the table mountain where Hades' palatial estate was built where you can have a panoramic view of the Underworld. Everything seems fine and as it should be. \"Patroclus,\" the god said calmly. \"What did you say the words of the prophet were?\" \"Under the rage of Achilles...\" What was it? Tiresias did not actually say the Underworld herself, didn't she? \"Hades will fall? And not the god, she said.\" \"Those were the exact words?\" \"Yes.\" I saw Theseus twitched from the corner of my eye and muffled his face to stifle himself from bursting out laughing. Even Persephone turned around to hide herself from giggling. Aesclepius feigned a cough while trying to be civil about it and Heracles remained as deadpanned Heracles. Only Lethe and Hades remained stiffly frustrated and they were not seemed very inclined to explain to me why. Achilles, the love of my life, gods bless him, was rather pouty and sulky about it. \"It's not like I can raze one of the three realms to ashes, Patroclus.\" \"Listen up Achilles. You're wonderful and all that, but no, I wouldn't put it past you to do just that.\" Theseus laughed even harder he crouched on his knees. Finally, it was Aesclepius who deigned to enlighten me of the error of my ways. \"Well, you're a newly-minted ghost Patroclus so you aren't probably aware of this yet but I know that in the land of the living, when they say 'Hades', it means both the god and the realm he rules, but here, when the dead says 'Hades', then it means both the god and his estate, specifically the castle, the entire palatial grounds. The dead just calls the Underworld, 'Underworld'.\" \"Hold on. So when she said Hades will fall and not the god...\" \"Tiresias just meant the castle will be destroyed. Which it was.\" I scrubbed my face with a very confused palm, \"Why would you make a prophecy as trivial as some property being destroyed? Castles get destroyed all the time.\" \"Trivial?\" snapped the god testily. \"Compared to the entire realm of the dead, I mean.\" \"Maybe that was not the prophecy,\" suggested Persephone. \"I heard Tiresias has been shaking things up in the trade. Some people say he no longer reveals prophecies in words but in nonverbal cues. Others say that he gets you distracted with some long-winded random narrative to catch unaware whoever expects him to be gnomic. I don't know. Was there anything else out of place?\" If anything, everything was out of place. First he was a woman. Then he talked about why he was a woman. Then there was talk about snakes, about settling a debate, all the while busying her fingers knitting two pieces of shawls together with one of them having lost most of its yarn, to make herself one whole piece of--oh. Was that it? Was that the metaphor all along and she wasn't actually just knitting for the sake of it? The metaphor was the prophecy? I clasped my knees wearily, \"Oh. Oh. Was that it? What the--how could I know from that? I wasn't informed prophecies are visual nowadays.\" *** We were in one of Hades' halls in his second palace, like a bunch of children brought in for questioning and scolding. It is still unmistakably luxurious and honestly if Theseus did not tell me that this is smaller than the one Achilles wrecked because it doesn't span the length of the Underworld's largest table mountain, I wouldn't even notice. \"Even so, I can't believe you got him to agree at all,\" Theseus said. \"No. It was only because the Queen helped me.\" \"To go as far as reversing the curse of Zeus himself...\" The more I looked back on it now, the more I think how impossible it has all been. From beyond a thick double-lidded door, slightly ajar, voices drifted. One was disgruntled. Stately and remorseful. It was Hades, \"That man. First he begged. Then he threatened.\" Followed by a voice I knew full well. Shamelessly unapologetic and divinely pleasant, \"Let me apologize for that. Bedroom habits die hard--\" I burst in the throne room, throwing the heavily-lidded doors out of the way as if they were paper, \"Oi!\" \"It's funny you still get embarrassed over this,\" Theseus whistled at my heels. \"You should be. It's not like you want your mother to know.\" \"Hades is not our mother.\" \"No, that's not the point. \"Then what is?\" \"Ugh.\" \"I will work on it as well,\" Heracles stepped forward, distracting us. \"After all I'm half the reason of the wreckage.\" \"Because you just have to stop me,\" Achilles grunted. \"I wouldn't even dream of it. I was merely stalling you.\" \"Did the two of them really...\" I mumbled. \"Well, yeah,\" Theseus muttered back. \"You could imagine how it was. Tremors were felt everywhere in the Underworld. It wasn't that hard to believe that the end is nigh. Which is weird because this here is the end. So it's like the end of the end is nigh.\" \"So does everybody, uh, know...\" \"No one said anything of course that it was Achilles who was marching madly to Hades.\" \"Oh good. That's--\" \"Because they already knew it was him. I mean, the odds of any devastating rumble that threatens the Underworld that is not caused by him is slim to nil. As anyone who has been dead long enough would tell you, 'it got so livelier in the last three hundred years'.\" \"I will build as many castles as you want,\" Achilles was saying. \"Though I must say I have only ever built our pavilion.\" \"His works of art though are something only Patroclus would love,\" interjected Theseus. \"Yes, and no heckling,\" I shushed. \"Deny it a little would you?\" \"Obviously I wouldn't leave it to you,\" the god said to the two of them. \"I'm trying to build a castle not win a war. Fine then. You'll be pardoned in exchange of your labor.\" \"I might not be worth much but I'll help,\" I volunteered. And a strange thing happened. I was half-expecting Hades to mock my offer or dismiss it entirely. But he looked at me all business-like, seriously considering it. \"You may be right,\" he said finally. \"I could use one with a reliable pair of hands and a reasonable head on him without a whiny mouth attached.\" \"Hey!\" that was Achilles. \"Hey!\" that was Theseus. The two of them looked at each other in chorus. \"What? Why are you protesting as well?\" Achilles spoke first. \"Obviously, I'll have Patroclus work in my Athens. He owes me a lot after that stunt he did with Heracles.\" Oh. I almost forgot about that. I awkwardly swiveled a head to glimpse at Heracles. He saw me peeking at him but he remained coolly indifferent about it. I bet being struck by a spear through the chest hardly bothers the greatest hero of all time but I bet it also never happened before. \"And why would he need to work for you? Why would he owe you?\" I could see a nerve or two popped on Theseus' head, \"Have you seriously forgot the room you thrashed?\" Oh. Achilles hissed, \"I would make you a new bed in all kinds of olive tree you want. Does that make you happy?\" \"And who do you think paid for all the bets placed in the last game? He will pay your share too.\" \"Then I will work for you too. That should be fine isn't it?\" \"Why are you, ugh, have you known you? You're a pain in--gods know where. Last time you prepped the grounds for the Pentathlon, you made me listen to all the nasty details when you made Patroclus your--hmmm!\" Achilles muted Theseus with his right hand on his mouth and with his left hand, he grabbed Heracles beside him by the elbow and shoved him in between them. \"Then take him!\" he declared. \"Patroclus and I are good enough to build a castle or two.\" I could almost hear Heracles' unflinching indifference shattering to broken pieces of bewilderment from where I stood. This chapter contains NSFW (sorry children) and sweetness and sweetness. And to those who may have previously thought, \"Where's the M in this work? The tag is inaccurate,\" and now finally thinks, \"7 chapters in then the creator remembers,\" welp apologies. But as Patroclus would like to say, it's pretty hard to make out when your partner is under the threat of total non-existence so he must first figure that one out. Which he did and now he's happy to go back to his more pleasant priorities. (See the end of the chapter for more notes.) We were back in Elysian Pelion. Back home again. With him. His mood has considerably improved. It still stung him to have the follies wrought by his unauthorized jaunts to Tartarus shared to me. I kept reassuring him I didn't mind it all. It didn't work. I told him that it was a cheap bargain in exchange for his soul. It also didn't work. I convinced him that it hardly hindered me at all. It was hardly convincing. In the end, I have to lean to his cheek, intentionally brush my lips on that sensitive skin behind his ear, and whispered in a very low, smitten voice, \"It ignites me to see something of mine in you all the time I can't stand it.\" I don't think I'm far gone to resort to something like dirty talk in broad daylight when it comes to matters I'd rather resolve lucidly but it seems weirdly effective. It has been a while. I was expecting Pat to come barking at us in welcome but he did not. For half a second I was worried he might have died of starvation until we found him wagging his tail frenetically to someone who appeared to be waiting for us in the pavilion. It was Rhadamanthus, ruler of Elysium, son of Zeus, and brother of Minos and Sarpedon. The same Sarpedon who died on my hands. It was always awkward to meet him but he has never shown me any grudges for anything we did back when we were alive. Here, in the Underworld, he is only one of the three judges, weighing the merits of souls as he sees them. \"It's about time you arrive,\" he said, weary and stern. He handed me a dark velvet pouch. I peered inside. \"You need to wear one yourself.\" It is another Stone. \"Um, uh, thank you,\" I replied, not really knowing what else to say. Rhadamanthus panned his eyes from me to Achilles. \"You really now have the same shared soul.\" Somehow the way both he and Hades looked at us made me wonder if we now appear differently to them. There was always that curious squint, that double pause as if they were confirming who they've got. I would have wanted to pry more out of Hades but it felt like it would have cost us more than a castle if I did. \"Uh, will there be any adverse repercussions?\" I asked. \"You mean other than your eye, some scars and your broken heel?\" \"No. I mean genuinely adverse repercussions.\" \"You mean the kind that are adverse only to Achilles?\" \"No,\" Achilles cut in, his voice could bend steel. \"He means aside from his eye, the scars, and the broken heel.\" \"I don't know. Hades does not bind souls for a hobby. So, except maybe for a few obvious things.\" \"Like what?\" \"As already demonstrated, both blessings and curses are shared. Your soul is entangled to the other, and it's the kind that makes distance irrelevant. You are half of each other's soul, and now it's not only for the poets to say. It will be for anyone who sees it to say, gods and mortals alike. You share a bond as ancient as the gods. If there's anyone who should know what is that like, why don't you tell me?\" We looked at each other, confused but satisfied. \"But...\" Gods, can they not, for the love of their wretched omniscience be putting calculated 'buts' or 'what-ifs' at the end of their good news? If it wasn't all that good from the start then don't let us soar on empty hopes then watch us fall flat on our backs. \"Philtatos, you remember why Zeus split humans from their halves in the first place, don't you?\" \"Because humans as double-beings are a threat to the gods, is that the one?\" \"Yes.\" I wrinkled my nose, confused and waiting more from him. It did not come. \"And then?\" I prompted, helpfully. Achilles shrugged, \"So what? I have always been a threat to anyone, the living, the dead, gods, mortals. What changed?\" Gods, that cheek in that mouth of his. And I love him for it. \"Yes, and that's you Achilles,\" Rhadamanthus replied. \"Nothing much might have changed for you. But we are yet to see what it is for your half.\" It was all baffling but I have had a lot to deal with recently. Achilles is here with me and nothing else matters. \"Let's not keep you then,\" we politely saw him off. *** It was late afternoon in our Elysium. I don't know how long we were gone but it did not seem like we had any unwelcomed visitors. No visible harpies perched among the trees. \"Oh it is back,\" Achilles exclaimed. The beach of sprawling fine white sand, the glittering sea rolled out before our view, extending out to the horizon, emptying to gods know where here in the Underworld. Despite what Achilles may say about his mother, he could never truly hide his excitement whenever the sea appears. It's always on his face, like a paint that refused to be peeled off, that childish delight, that sort of vague reminiscence of his youth. He ran towards the beach. I kept my eyes peeled on him, even if only one of them can see him, it has no problem watching, taking in the sight of him so intently that I could almost feel the wind that brushed his hair, the taste of salt on his skin. This is what I would be missing if I gave up, and suddenly it hurt. My stomach squeezed inside me at the mere of thought of it. It was hard and scary and it all felt too hopeless, but Achilles is here and oh. He's here and it is all worth it. He's here and it's everything. My knees buckled under me and before I knew it, I was crying I almost couldn't believe it. As if all the pent-up emotions I dammed up inside because I don't have the time to go through them just swelled and broke through all my defenses. All of it. My insecurities, my fears, the pain of losing him again--all of it just bubbled in my chest, begging to be felt. Suddenly my tears were pouring on my cheeks and spilling on the sand. I'm glad. I'm so thankful I did not let him go. I don't care how many things I gave up when I was alive, slipping through my fingers as if I never deserve any of them, my mother, my father, my name, my home, my future. But this time--this one time when it matters, this one time when it meant the world to me, I'm so glad I hold on to it. And I will keep holding on to it, no matter what it cost me. \"Patroclus! The water feels good! Let's--WHAT'S WRONG?\" he came running to me, his face dissolving into panic as he saw me crying. \"Something is wrong after all?\" his voice trembled. \"No, no, no,\" I touched his arm, smiling, reassuring him. \"I'm fine. Nothing is wrong. I'm just really, really relieved. It's all just coming to me now. I was on the verge of losing you again--and that's--\" Oh gods, I really couldn't stop crying. \"That's really terrifying,\" I sobbed. \"The idea of not being able to see you again, even as a ghost...I can't stand it.\" Achilles wrapped his arms around my head, pulling me close to his chest. I could smell the sea on him. \"I'm sorry... I'm sorry...It was all because of me,\" he kissed my hair, my forehead, the corner of my eyes, as if to soothe me. \"I'm here now. I'm here. You brought me back to you.\" I returned his embrace, burying myself into him, yes, yes, just like this tall wave which is about to bury us in three...two--uh. The tide surged and fell, crashing into us and drenching us both. We both fell into laughter. To be honest, I would rather us be back in the cave right now, back to its warmth, our bed lying just under the stars. That's what I would rather. But Achilles is now dripping wet in front of me, the fabric of his chiton sticking on his skin, showing what lies underneath, the smooth lines of his sinews, then there is that supple neck of his and those shoulders attached to it, those well-sculpted collarbones just underneath, the protrusion on his throat that I know how to tease out of him, and all the things I can do with them. I would rather us back in the cave right now. But here he is in my arms, a beauty like no other, criminally perfect, endlessly endearing. And there's pretty much nothing I can do about it. I pulled him by the back of his head and I squeezed our mouths together, which is as inelegant as it sounds, but nothing about what I feel right now is even remotely elegant. I slipped him the tongue and he just melted. He returned my kisses, twisting his tongue this way and that, in that way he knows best, which is rough and ravishing. \"I want you,\" I gasped, dazed. He chuckled, \"I heard you the first time.\" His fingers are all over me and my lips are all over him. I can feel his fingertips on my scalp, combing through my hair. I am at his throat, right beneath the chiseled curve of his jaw, gliding my lips through it, kissing his neck, the length of his shoulders which readily flush red at the merest graze. He stares at me. He has been staring at me a lot. Then I remember that until a while ago he cannot see. I only didn't feel that much difference because he put the work to make it seem that nothing changed. He did all of it so I can continue to be with the Achilles in my memories, the unblemished, invincible Aristos Achaion, and not the one who cannot walk without an artificial tendon attached to him, not the one with all those whip scars on him, and definitely not the one who cannot even see the man he has been waiting all this time. \"I miss seeing this look on you,\" he whispered. \"What look?\" \"The look that says how much you want me. I have been trying to imagine it all this time.\" \"Then go on and take a long hard look...at the face of a man who is drowning with desire for you.\" We felt so heady and floaty that I don't think I'll be able to recount even with a cool head how we found ourselves drifting in the sea. I was beneath the water when I went down on him. My hands on his hips, his hands on my head. I let my hands wander around him. That dip on his waist, the shallow grooves by the side of his abdomen, that part of his stomach where his navel had been. The inside of his thighs. Since I cannot see his face, I can only tell how I am doing by the way his fingers run themselves on my head, or the way his body curls or the way his hips slowly thrust. I want to feel him. I want to feel him when he peaks. But just before that, I am yanked off the water by the two hands on my head, and kissed--kissed as if all the kisses we had before were never enough. I kiss him back, two bodies sharing the same soul bobbing up and down with the tides. Slight annoyance darts on his face as the water stubbornly insists on disrupting us. He brings his hands on my shoulders, and we both dive down and deep, so now we are both underneath the waves where the currents are calmer and more steady. We are a tangle of limbs. I lock my arms around him and his arms go over my shoulders and around my neck. We do not care about where we are or how deep we have been swimming. We cannot see anything else but each other. One soul that has been aching for its half for as long as it can remember. One soul that is filling itself whole. One soul that finally feels complete. We come out to the surface gasping not for air but for each other. The sand is soft and comfortable. We crawl back up to the beach, him sitting on that space between my folded knees while I sit cross-legged, his back turned at me. We are both wearing the Stone of Rhadamanthus so we remain blind to the reminders of Tartarus. I lick his nape, alternating between biting and kissing. His hair dripping beads of water on his shoulders did nothing but only make them more enticing. He clasps my forearm, unable to tangle his fingers in any of the fingers from both of my hands because they are both busy pinching and kneading other places. I fondle him with one hand, with the other around his thigh, his body pressed against mine. I can feel his heat, his pleasure, as he arcs and twitches, his sweetest moans skipping him. \"Pa...Patroclus...I'm...\" I twirled his face towards me by his chin and mumbled, drawing a breath so close to his lips he trembled, \"Then come for me Achilles.\" I sealed his lips as he spilled himself in my hand. \"Just me again,\" he complained. \"You really don't have to do this,\" I said, as I watched him peering at me from between my legs. \"Wow, who is saying that?\" he grinned. \"I have been feeling this grinding at my back since earlier.\" He puts on his cat smile and keeps his eyes fixed on me, a pair of royally elegant emerald and warm melted chestnut. I helplessly throw a hand over my face. Oh his fluttering eyes and his pretty little mouth and all the things he does with them. \"Hnghh momnning hnor fmes...\" \"Please do one thing at a time Achilles.\" \"No covering your face.\" Then he added, \"Especially now that I can see it.\" I did as I was told and watch him. I could feel the air caught in my lungs. My toes curl and bury themselves underneath the sand, painfully aware of how good the fine grains felt on my skin, painfully aware of how good it all felt. He fixed me with a gaze that held me where I sat. He pins my knees on my side, with him wedged between them. I look at him and I gulp down at the sight of him. I swallowed hard and he looks like he wants to follow my throat down my neck. I cradle his cheek with a palm, and he nuzzles with it. I groan. I am not there yet. He did not bring me there. He knows what he is doing, pushing me right to the edge, just close enough to fall without having to jump. My eyes caught a table of shale carved not too far from us, waves crashing beneath it. Smooth layered claystone, wide and circular, punctured with holes in places that are filled by water. It looks perfect to me. \"Hey!\" he protested as I dragged him along. Until he saw where I was bringing him. \"Oh sweetheart. Should I worry on what you intend to do to me there?\" \"No such thing. But you should at least be prepared to beg.\" I throw him above it and he lies flat on his back. I followed him and climbed on top of the stone as well. \"Strip,\" he ordered, high and mighty. He sees how hard I was. He giggles. \"Who's going to beg now?\" \"Tease.\" I slung his leg over my shoulder and I suck at the skin by his thigh, bruising it carefully, one after another, an inch after inch closer. He watches me as I go through all the motions of it. He keeps his mouth behind the back of his hand, stifling all the noises that comes from it. Then he reaches out for my hand with his free hand and brings it in his mouth, licking the fingers on it, his tongue darting in and out of each them, wetting them one by one. Sometimes when I caught myself in that space between solid clarity and high-strung madness, I almost cannot bring myself to believe we can be like this, that we can be allowed to be like this. This would be unimaginable when we were alive. Sunset at the beach. The waves crashing beneath us. Right under the open sky, in the middle of the open sea. As if we are compensating on that time we were on a beach and just his lips brushing against mine sent us scurrying away out of fear that his mother might see, that the gods might see, or that anyone might see. But him right here with me, a trembling heap of pleasured mess. There is almost something unspeakably transgressive about it and all of that only makes the blood pound louder in my ears. I push a finger in and he yelps slightly. I twist his body to his side. I can reach in deeper this way. He tenses, as if bracing himself. Then the second finger in, up to the second knuckle, then the third. \"I want you without the Stone,\" I said. To be honest, he never really needed to hide those scars from me. It does nothing to how much I desire him. But this is something I don't ask of him often because I know it still bothers him and also because I don't want to remind him of what he had been through before I arrived. I kiss his hand, \"You know how I want you just the same.\" He hesitates but nods, \"Only if you also remove yours.\" I slid it off my neck. He tugged at his own necklace swiftly and surely, then carelessly chucked it somewhere. \"How about revenge?\" he offers his wrists to me, pressed to each other as if bound. I suck the air through my gritted teeth. He laughs. I am a taut string. He knows it and he relishes tugging at me harder. I indulge him and I bind his hands with the string of my necklace, the Stone dangling from it. I pin those wrists with a single hand over his head. I look at him and I savor the image of him like this. The stretch of muscles that wrap themselves around his ribs, drawn out tighter with his arms above his head. The tough and flexible sinews behind his upper arm, tensing and flexing at each movement. He props himself slightly and hoops his bound arms around my head and pulls me down and close, his lips brushing my ear, both of his legs hooking themselves below my hips. Now it is his turn to kiss the scars on my body. \"Show me how you want me,\" he whispered. I glided my hands underneath, lifting his chiton with it. My touch leaks the moans from his throat. I bore down on him, my body pressed on him, our hips grinding at each other. He dug at the skin on my back, cutting our teeth on pleasure we are learning from each other's body, as if what we had all this time was never enough. My thumb seared against his temples, sweat and water mixed, I cradled his head between my hands and brought his lips to mine, tucking his body in. I hemmed and sawed. To say I drank him in will never be enough. I want him the way Tantalus wants to drink water, the way he wants to taste that fruit. Except that unlike Tantalus, I can drink my water and taste the fruit and I will still be left in wanting. We felt the strength left our bodies, satiated, two half-souls who finally found each other. You know what they say. There are two kinds of friends in this world: casual ones who decided to read this fic because they couldn't sleep at night and couldn't find anything else that would bore them more. Then serious ones who think they are gourmet of erotic fic writing whose feedback to me can be pretty much summed up with, \"not enough positions.\" This, my friend, is my last attempt. Although I can count all the erotic scenes I ever wrote in one hand and all the erotic scenes I ever wrote in this series on the same hand so go easy on me. This chapter I dedicate to those friends lol PS Friend No. 1: If this lingered in you long enough that you lost sleep over this, then that's how I know I made it. PS Friend No. 2: Look, I'm pretty proud of 'hemmed and sawed'. I bet you missed that. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) \"So, uh,\" Persephone tapped a polished finger on the table. \"Just asking. I mean, I know it's too late to do anything about it, but, uh, you're not that mad are you?\" \"About what?\" Hades answered her across one of their suite of rooms. Where is this? In Hades' second palace? \"When I saw Patroclus wandering in my garden looking every bit of a lost soul, I know I want to help him. I don't regret it and I still wouldn't regret it even if, you know, even if he didn't succeed,\" she said. \"And I know I shouldn't be saying something like that as the Queen of the Underworld. To lose your realm on behalf of one ghost is unthinkable. But I look at Patroclus and I can hear Orpheus' head bobbing on the Island of Lesbos, still singing of his love for Eurydice, still mourning of her lost. It haunts me until now. And I just don't want to see something like that again.\" Is this a dream? Are you supposed to know it's a dream when you're in one? Hades' eyes fell on the lone potted pomegranate plant by the corner of the room, a rather odd detail on the overall decoration, then to the taller vases beside it as if studying their paint. More like he couldn't bring himself to look at her. Even after all this time if he stares at her long enough, he gets a funny feeling in the pit of his stomach. He loves his wife dearly. That, he knows. Though he doubts if she does. Not with the way he claimed her. She is the goddess of spring, the goddess of hope, someone who prizes beauty in impermanence, someone who'd rather burn beautifully very briefly than live in gloom for eternity. A complete opposite of him. That's also what he loves about her. She's someone he shouldn't be allowed to keep by his side. But she's here. And if she says she wants to burn Hell itself for the sake of one soul, then she very might as well do and he will watch it burn with her. \"I am sorry too about Orpheus,\" he said, finally. \"I tried what I can. But that was all the chance the laws of the gods could give him.\" \"I know.\" \"And I'm not that mad because I was never mad to begin with.\" \"That's not true.\" \"It is,\" he replied simply but firmly. \"Those two really are just...exhausting. Then there's them with their souls restored to each other and what that meant. We're prepared for Achilles. We've seen the things he did and we know the things he can do. Achilles is a drawn out sword that you can see coming, but Patroclus...that's the thing. He's a sword too but you won't know that until his blade is already under your rib.\" \"So this is what it means on having both curses and blessings shared?\" Hades nodded, \"He is now every bit of a warrior as Achilles. To say the Underworld now have a pair of Aristos Achaion wouldn't be wrong.\" \"That sounds fun.\" \"Extremely,\" Hades tried to smile to indulge his wife but he really couldn't pull the corner of his lip high enough. \"Achilles is an invincible half-god to begin with and now with Zeus' curse undone, they also reverted back as double-beings, which is something the king of gods himself feared, powerful enough to rival us should they wish to. And I doubt they even realize any of that.\" \"Hmm, Patroclus?\" the goddess paused, tilting her head. \"He's pretty much done thinking after the glyph of Tartarus disappeared on Achilles. And um, Achilles...nope...he's always been powerful and all that. I don't think he does a lot on any of those things: notice, realize or think. Impulse drives him and that pretty much sums up his life and afterlife.\" I was gliding through the hall, peering at a room. I feel like I keep hearing something important that I will forget later on. Hades pinched that space on his forehead between his brows, \"They are Hell's most problematic power couple to be honest and just the thought of having to babysit them for the rest of time is already making me tired.\" \"You worry too much dear.\" \"I think I should. One of them already altered the landscape of Hell as he pleased, flouted the rules, breached Tartarus, and destroyed a castle. While the other wouldn't even bat an eye in razing it all down for the sake of one soul--and all of that, back then when they were still something not akin to a god.\" \"But all of that, back then, were because they were threatened to lose the other. If anything, you should worry less about it now because their souls have been bound.\" Then she added, rather unnecessarily, \"I bet right now they are melting into each other's heat they couldn't even think about anything else, much less the things you were worrying about.\" \"Uh, I really don't need to be reminded of that.\" \"What do you mean? It's beautiful. I'm planning to invite them over for a flower viewing and have them tell me all about it. I bet they can't refuse me. I'm their top patron.\" This is also one of the things he loves about her. Now that she mentioned about flower viewing, Hades said, \"I've been meaning to ask, but what's up with the potted pomegranate?\" \"Oh,\" Persephone seemed to have forgotten about the plant either. \"This is what has become of the flower Patroclus grew.\" \"That?\" \"Yes.\" \"I thought you grafted the flower back to the tree of memories?\" \"I did.\" \"And isn't it supposed to stay there as one of the flowers in eternal bloom?\" Persephone crouched down and started poking the potted plant's small pomegranates. \"We don't know what it's supposed to,\" she said. \"We just know that the flowers in that tree tend to stay there in eternal bloom--until this one didn't. The flower Patroclus grew bore a fruit which fell from the tree and before I realized it, it became like this. This needs to be replanted to give it a wider berth.\" \"It's still growing?\" \"I think it is. Unlike the others in the tree which were grown from the memories of the dead in Asphodel, this one is growing from 'living' memories, I mean, memories that are still being made and shared between the two of them.\" \"But Patroclus just grew that flower.\" \"Well, since they're half of each other now...\" \"Oh, so Achilles' memories are growing that too.\" \"Yep!\" she chirped. \"Lovely isn't it? I'm thinking of giving this to them so they can replant it in their Elysium and--oh I know!\" \"What?\" \"Since you're too worried about what they would do...\" \"That's because anything that happens to either of them, the Underworld also has to get involved.\" \"Exactly. So I'll plant this in my own garden.\" \"And how would that...?\" \"Like I've said, this pomegranate is growing from their memories, the memories they made before, the memories they are still making, and the memories they are about to make. In other words, the health of this pomegranate will tell us whatever is happening between the two of them that you should or should not worry about.\" \"Hold on Perse, that sounds, uh, quite rather the Elysian privacy-breaching surveillance. I'm not sure if it's lawful for us to--\" \"No,\" she said, determined. \"I think we have a duty to keep the rest of the Underworld safer from their potential future antics. I call this an early warning threat detection tree.\" \"Alright,\" Hades responded, smiling a little and not doubting a single word his wife said. \"It is what you said it is.\" I open my eyes, wide-awake now, I feel like I've had just some incredible dream and listened in to an equally incredible conversation. I cannot remember any of it except that they feel important and that they are currently slipping through my very muddled brain which is having a hard time to even tell up from down. So, first things first, I have to make a proper inventory of events, and probably establish our location, find where is north, extrapolate from it. Glean the position of the sun on the sky, the length of the shadows, whatever. Except that I wasn't able to do anything much beyond open my eyes and feel drunk. Intoxicated. Haze weighs on my head far more heavily than any alcohol has ever done. Ah yes, this, and this, and that. I can remember yesterday's sunset. And the sea. Definitely there was a sea. That much I am sure of. Beyond that, I cannot tell, for the love of all things holy, where did both the sea and the rest of the night go. It was already morning. And we were lying, or rather leaning to this massive and magnificent cedar tree that I never even knew we had in the middle of the pasture land of our Elysium. All our sheep, goats, and cows have already gone on the business of taking care of themselves because we have obviously very well failed them. They have been grazing and roaming and we have been sleeping, the Cloak of Alizarine acting as our blanket because our clothes cannot be bothered at the moment. I saw a flash on the midday sky--no, I did not actually see it. Rather, I sensed it was there. No, it wasn't actually there yet. Rather, I sensed it would be there in a short while. Like something ominous has been stalking us in the horizon. I very quickly slung my chiton around me. I dressed Achilles, careful not to wake him, tucked him under the cloak, and kissed him by the forehead. Then I ran towards our pavilion, to the shed that houses our kitchen supplies, gardening tools, as well as Achilles' bows and spears. I grabbed one of his spears. I cannot tell exactly what I am feeling threatened by or where exactly is that feeling coming from and why. I can only sense it and I just know. Like how some animals twitch their keen noses at the slightest whiff of danger. Or in my case, like how I stood in the middle of the field, eyes scouring the skies, Achilles' spear ready in my hand. Then it came. A glint of something. Like the tip of a blade. It darted unhesitatingly right where I stood. It did not merely drop from the sky but was very pointedly shot down. It was not thrown broadly. It has a target and it reached it--me. I might have screamed in alarm should I have the space for that but in that moment, all I could see was the tip of the blade, how it was perfectly aimed at me and my hand twirled the spear, its bladed end connected to it, dulled its speed, and sent the sword pirouetting back up in midair. It was a xiphos, a double-edged, one-hand shortsword. A malignant sneer almost crept up on my face when I realized that someone found it in themselves to threaten us with a 'secondary' weapon, something short enough that it demands a skilled close quarter combat and one-handed enough that its owner seems confident it can brace against anything using only the strength of their one arm. Which, as I would soon find out, is exactly the case. Someone caught the xiphos I tossed spinning in the air by the hilt and expertly rammed it downwards against me. I held the spear with both hands above my head so the blade of the xiphos fell at its center, and not--as it originally intended--on my head. I also managed to see what it was exactly that I was dealing with. What it was, was a pale-skinned young woman with a deathly cold glare on her eyes, wearing mourner's robes and sandals, and who also feels strangely familiar to me that I begin to believe I should know her. However, remembering was not at all made easier if you are fending for yourself while in the middle of it. She was, to say the least, extremely skilled in fighting as if she does this very professionally for a job. I, on the other hand, have not done anything that vaguely resembles anything warrior-like, either as a hobby or a job in life or in death. At times like this, when faced with insurmountable forces, mortals tend to pray to the gods above for help. However, being a ghost in the Underworld, that severely limited my choices. Then again, it's not like it would have made any difference if one is still alive, at least it did not work that way for me. After all the only reason I did not lose my life that early in the war was not because some god were protecting me but because Achilles was there, always keeping an eye out for me, preemptively shooting men to their deaths before they even came close. He's the one that works for me, I thought. More than any god, I'd rather speak of his name and call it a prayer. I remember that time he let me watch him secretly practicing with the spear, how he mentioned he does not let anyone else watch him fight, and how at first I did not understand why, until I saw how he fights then I knew. He fights like a warrior blessed by the gods that no ordinary mortal could ever come close to, no matter how much they work hard they would have to live with it. As one of those ordinary mortals, I lived with it. The gods have always been fickle and unfair, favoring some while cursing others, but if it's him they favored, I don't mind. I think back on all the times I watched him fight, how his lithe figure would wield the spear, how his swift-footedness would have doomed anyone before they even realized it, and how I have his own spear in my hand right now. A lightweight and perfectly well-balanced double-ended spear: a thrusting pike on one end and a slicing double-edged blade on the other. My body has been moving on its own, not having any spare second to pause and reflect on what it is doing or what to do next. I was merely replaying how Achilles fights in my memories and was hit by a damning realization that I really don't know how to fight any other way except his way. There is no one I have watched more than him and therefore I can only fight like him. Fighting half-blind has further sunk in me just how impressive Achilles has been, going toe to toe against Heracles himself, while being completely blind. Then again, a fight like that requires you to react faster than you can see and he has always been terrifyingly adept with that. I, on the other hand, for the lack of choice, have been trying. Despite being blindsided on my left, I could quite sense where the next one is coming. And I don't think being able to see fully would have helped anyway because by then it would be too late. She is terrifyingly quick, as if her feet do not even touch the ground. She is extremely clever too. She keeps jabbing the xiphos right on my chest, where it is the hardest to defend with a long weapon. I evaded all of her attempts by always sidestepping to the side and keeping myself at spear-length. She still manages to sneak in through all that so I can only spar against her with the middle section of the spear that I have been holding with both my hands, which also tends to be trickier than holding a sword with a hilt. At least you know where to put your hand if you have a weapon with a hilt. Wielding a spear means adjusting your hands along its entire length as situation demands. She is also brutally efficient with her movements, not letting up at all, the tail of her robes fluttering sharply behind him. She is raining her offense that all I could hear is the blunt thud of her blade against the shaft of my spear and the sharp thrill when it hit the bladed end. I rallied as her blade falls, defending more than attacking. Then her blade pressed firmly on the shaft of my spear, forcing a battle of power, her sword inching closer on my face. I held my ground and pushed, pushed, and pushed back, until she peeled her sword away as I drove her backwards. I huffed, \"Would you mind--?\" But I was wrong. She did not step back because she withdrew. She did so she could lunge herself anew towards me, using the distance to gain momentum. I clicked my tongue. Seriously. I braced myself. Just when I thought I knew how her blade is going to fall, it changed course. Of course it was all but a ruse on her end. I should have known. Instead of attacking from above or center, she dropped on her leg and swiped the sword from under me. I saw this before. But back then it was done to Achilles and I'm no Achilles. I sighed and in those terrifying few seconds I have, I remembered hard what he did. I straightened my back. I'm not going to let anything ruin what we gained this far. In that split second before she dropped on her leg to swing the sword by my legs, I ran up towards her and thrust the pointed end of the spear to the ground and like a vertical pole I used it to vault myself above her head. She looked like she expected me to do exactly that, which is probably rule no. 1 on the things not to do during battles: getting predicted by the opponent. She spun on her heel just as quickly, her blade already waiting on where I was about to land. Shifting position mid-air is pretty much an impossible maneuver given the lack of anything to anchor yourself with, unless you have wings, which I don't. Or, unless of course you time it well enough, and nimble reflexes are something you don't think of very much like water to a fish, then you can land to the shaft of the exact blade that has been trying to impale you on the exact moment it appeared there--and use that as a springboard for your previously impossible mid-air maneuver and somersault the hell out to safety, which was exactly what I did. Oh Achilles, I thought. How you made it all look too easy. Thankfully, I was able to land on my feet few paces away from her. Thankfully, she also finally ceased her torrential assault. She looked at me seeming contented. I tried again, \"Sorry, but would you mind--?\" Then the ground shook. It was as unmistakable as anything, I felt bloodlust shot up right from behind me. He is here. Achilles lunged from above wielding another one of his spears pointed towards our dark-robed visitor. The pointed end connected and she caught it right at the middle of her blade, defending against all the power that spear was thrust with only one hand. Achilles spun and sparred, this time becoming the one on unrelenting offense. Each strike he made connected and it shook the ground. This time she was not even bothering to return any of his attack. Like me from earlier, she was just defending. This increasingly irritated Achilles and decided to throw one fatal thrust at her and I have a bad feeling about it. \"Achilles--wait--\" I called. \"CALM DOWN!\" someone screamed, unflinchingly wedging himself between the blades of a spear and a sword with nothing but his body and sheer unadulterated grit. And this time it is someone I don't have a problem recognizing. That was a writing workout. Actiony stuffs. A fight scene right after an erotic scene. I honestly don't have lots of verb exercise as someone who mainly ever lives off sedentary nonfictional explainy stuff lol \"No, you calm down,\" followed another voice, for there were two of them. It was smooth like honey and subdued like poisoned. \"And what, in my name, do you think you're doing?\" \"Whoa. You actually called it on your name. You're pretty mad aren't you?\" the plucky boy gasped in mock surprise, his arms outstretched in utter mad hope that it would stop the two blades from clashing. Of course it wouldn't and it didn't and he should have been impaled very thoroughly a second ago had it not been for this other boy standing behind him who pulled him by the shoulder and with his other hand stopped Achilles' spear, neatly stopping the iron-tipped pike between his two fingers. As if stopping blades throttling down in full power and speed in the nick of time with only his fingers is something he does very professionally for a job. Achilles hissed but withdrew. The dark-robed woman sheathed her xiphos and stepped back too. Her eyes darted between Achilles and me, squinting really hard at us, as if her perfectly sharp pair of eyes suddenly began failing her. She looked very confused but she seemed very willing to shrug it off if it meant she could get out here faster. She seemed like she would really mind tarrying any longer than this. In fact, she already looked like she would rather do something else than talk to us. She announced, \"The Aristos Achaion passed. I see to it that he is qualified to the become your mentor.\" Huh?! Now there are a lot of things to be surprised about what she said. Like, for instance, who passed what, what did he pass, and who is going to be a mentor of whom. But what is more surprising than any of that is the fact that she doesn't seem to know who is the Aristos Achaion she meant to be talking about because she has been decidedly looking at me while undecidedly glancing at Achilles. Then with a spark of finality and idle compromise, her eyes settled on me. The boy asked, \"You mean Achilles?\" \"Yes, him,\" she pointed at me. \"At least that's the one I tested. And gods have mercy on you if you make me test this other one. I have work.\" \"That's Patroclus. This other one is Achilles.\" She grunted, still squinting at the two of us, \"Nope. Looks the same to me.\" \"I guess primordial gods cannot really tell,\" he then turned to the other boy who previously saved him, \"Actually, how could you?\" \"I can't either, but Hades said there's a trick to being able to tell them apart. If it feels like it's likely to attack you, that's Achilles. But if it feels like a perfectly calm river that you shouldn't be crossing, that's Patroclus.\" \"Is it?\" the dark-robed woman said musingly, looking at us. \"Hmm. That seems like it.\" \"I really can't tell how souls must look at you two,\" said the boy. \"We don't look at them,\" said the other boy. \"Yes. It's more like we sense them,\" replied the woman. \"Sorry, can I get word in?\" I let my impatience got to me. \"First off, I have no idea who might you all be. And secondly, what is this talk about not being able to tell us apart.\" \"Oh that. Well, primordial gods like these two can only see--or sense souls since that's what they deal with mostly. Anything living in their mortal flesh is not their business yet,\" the boy explained, as if primordial gods only seeing souls is the dreariest thing he ever said. \"With the two of you having the same soul, as in soul-bound and all, you now look exactly the same to them. And that's true the older the god is. Younger gods and those born with mortals in their lineage can pretty much tell you apart. Those who made it their job to rule over souls and judge them might have to pause and squint a bit to be able to tell.\" He paused and seemed to have remembered, \"Oh, and to answer your first question, the one here who tested you is Megaera.\" Oh. I feel like the inside of my stomach lurched. I know that name. She regarded us fiercely and coldly. The boy laughed the sudden heavy atmosphere that fell on us, \"One of the Erinyes, goddess of--hold on, what do you punish again?\" \"Infidelity? Cheaters, liars, breakers of marriage vows--and look, I know what you're thinking: with the countless broken marriage vows with married men and women sleeping with whoever, am I even doing my job? And the answer to that is--yes because that actually is not my job. They only use my name to scare their spouses from cheating. Because believe me, if that actually is my real job...\" an almost devilish grin flitted on her lips. \"Zeus won't even have a second chance to try again. And with that, I'm going to leave. My real job is waiting for me.\" She left as quickly as she arrived, a blur of shadow that flashed on the sky. \"She's a childhood friend, the warrior of us all. Fighting her is courting disaster,\" the boy shrugged, in that way you do when you tell someone they have just courted disaster. \"Then this one here is Thanatos, the God of Death, a job he actively hates, and also my best friend, a strenuous relationship I have been trying so hard to change into something that will make me his boyfriend--\" \"Seriously?\" said the god. \"With no success thus far,\" the boy cheerily continued, blatantly ignoring him. \"As I remain to be dumped for as long as I can remember. As a result, I'm looking to spend the rest of eternity in a bittersweet unrequited love to my best friend which in turn, will make me the Underworld's most eligible bachelor, unless of course I can make him change his mind.\" Then he added, in afterthought, \"Oh, and I'm Zagreus by the way, son of Hades and Persephone, which probably makes me the prince. Nice to meet you.\" Just when I thought I could recognize them as those two boys back in Theseus' Elysian Athens during the Pentathlon, the ones who helped me retrieve Hades' cloak after it was accidentally 'misappropriated' over gambling reasons, the one with an odd pair of eyes, one green and red, and the one with him dressed in pure black, they turned out to be significantly more than I can simply recognize. One is a pureblood offspring of the gods while the other is a primordial god as old as time. \"Do you think we could have used some warning in advance? Being attacked out of nowhere is a bit...\" \"I heard you were supposed to be informed about it.\" As if on cue, we noticed the rising columns of smoke coming out from the pavilion, indicating that someone else has just invited themselves over without permission, and indicating that it might be someone we know full well. *** \"Oh hi there, finally you show up. We're here to celebrate first thing in the morning. I can't believe we can't get ahold of you. Also, I can't believe I'm the one serving your guests. By the way, we used your kitchen,\" he said not even looking at us, both of his hands occupied with bowls filled with spiced uncooked meat. \"Oh yeah, one of the sisters, the goddess versatile on all weapons she could effectively slice through anything even with the dullest knife, known under the fake title of the 'Jealous One' and also the prince's stand-in mentor is coming for Achilles to test--oh.\" He then turned around and finally saw us, with both the prince mentioned and the best friend he's in love with in tow. That was of course Theseus who uses the place like it is an extension of his palace in Elysian Athens. \"So she already came?\" he said as his eyes briefly fell on us, his attention divided over a million other things in the kitchen. \"Is this fine? Tastes bland to me,\" for some reason, even Heracles was there fiddling with a bowl of batter. \"Might be lacking something. Heracles, if you mess up something as simple as these pancakes, I'll be too embarrassed to accept your bride's dowry. Don't think you're hotshot just because--hmpf!\" Heracles just poked a finger with the batter in Theseus' mouth. \"Then tell me what's lacking.\" \"Honey.\" \"Yes?\" \"Honey, I said.\" \"What?\" \"Or what, you don't want this sweet?\" \"Oh I do. I very much do.\" \"Then get on with it.\" \"I have been all this time.\" A voice from the outside, \"Your Highness, the hot coals are about to go out. Are you not even using this to grill anything?\" Theseus cursed under his breath, \"My gods, I forgot. Wait! Skewer this first and grill them!\" And just like that, he shuffled out of our sight from the kitchen and Achilles followed him. The prince and his best friend trailed after him as well which leaves me alone with Heracles who was now pouring copious amounts of our honey to his batter. \"Sorry, what's happening?\" \"He wants to throw a banquet,\" he said. \"But figured the two of you might not want to go to his Athens, so he brought all of these here.\" \"Uh, and since when have you been here?\" \"This morning. You're not coming down from the mountain and you're not in the pavilion either. He waited for like, a blink or two, before deciding to start grilling.\" \"And those outside?\" \"Umm? The seven? They have been drinking since they arrived.\" \"Drinking?\" \"Yes.\" \"Like tea?\" \"No, like wine.\" I dashed outside. \"I. Am. Not. Drinking,\" Achilles spelled it out for me when he saw me slightly frantic, raising a plate of fig pie to me, occupying a space on one of the long tables. I scanned our pavilion, and for some reason, it felt...uh, full and busy. \"Oh nice,\" Zagreus said, immediately pulling himself up by the hearth. Thanatos sat down beside him. \"The hearth is blessed. Hestia likes this place very much.\" The god of death looked around the hustle and bustle around the pavilion, to the dead who have not even noticed him yet, to the dead who have been drinking both wine and tea this morning, eating pickled olives and fig pies. Something deliriously similar to a smile almost flickered on his face. \"No. It's because this place is like this that Hestia blessed their hearth. Not the other way round.\" \"Come on. If you cannot love me at least don't antagonize me.\" The god of death groaned, \"Must you always remind me?\" \"How else would l I know if you already changed your mind.\" Outside the pavilion, hot coals glowed on the ceramic trays where the skewered meat will be grilled. Theseus and his retinue brought these portable grill as well as the griddles from where I believe Heracles would cook his pancakes. There were several of these smoking grills and griddles arranged in a semicircle and being tended to by the seven, who were also getting drunk while on it, except for Amphiaraus who was sipping tea. It felt strange, for some reason, to have Heracles back in our kitchen making pancakes, Theseus and his band of seven grilling skewered meat in front of our pavilion, and the Prince of the Underworld and the God of Death huddled up in the corner by our hearth. If a prophet ever told me when I was alive that in the afterlife, this is what I would be having, I would not believe it. All of this felt kind of wrong to me somehow. But then, I see Achilles munching down on a fig pie I made for him, crumbs on his cheeks and suddenly everything feels right. I smiled and thought to myself, yes, this is how it is supposed to be. \"WHAT?!\" Theseus exclaimed. Gods, what is it this time. \"What do you mean the Eumenides came and fought Patroclus? Also, why didn't I see it? I wanted to watch it. Why didn't you call me?\" Oi. What do you mean you want to watch? Is this all an entertainment to you? I met Theseus' eyes and just when I wanted to make a run for it, he caught me by the arm and fussed about it, \"You! You...did you?\" \"He did,\" Tydeus, one of the seven, said. \"We saw the whole thing from up here. It was entertaining.\" \"What?!\" now it's my turn to scream. \"You watched the whole thing--and you just watched the whole thing?\" \"That's one of the Eumenides you know. You don't make a point of crossing her.\" \"Having a fight like that to watch made the wine better.\" \"We called you, you know,\" said the other to Theseus. \"Didn't you even notice the earthquakes just now?\" \"Achilles fought too,\" said the other. \"Hence, the earthquakes. Seriously what were you even doing with Heracles you didn't notice?\" \"And then?\" Theseus asked. \"And then what?\" \"I'm asking how did the judgment go?\" \"She just said the Aristos Achaion passed. Although she seemed confused as to whether she meant Achilles or me.\" \"Ah, oh, yes, of course,\" he replied, unsurprised. \"But what are you doing taking on one of the sisters? First, you swam Lethe. Now you crossed with one of the venerable goddesses? Just where all this daring coming from?\" \"Because no one told us that she is scheduled to drop in today and Achilles should have been ready for that.\" \"How am I supposed to tell you that if I cannot even find you? Rhadamanthus said he just gave you the Stone yesterday, so where were you actually--hold on, where are the Stones?\" It's the season for banquet. (See the end of the chapter for more notes.) Theseus, gods bless him, would not stop laughing. And I feel like I've seen him like this before. \"Where are the stones?\" he asked. I looked at Achilles. It was not around his neck. I fumbled around my chest and mine was not there either. My very muddled mind tried its best to sort out its memories of last night. The last time I saw them was when--oh. \"Hey, what's with that look? Don't tell me you lost them? Then start looking for them already. Achilles is one thing. But how did you lose yours too Patroclus--\" Theseus' eyes alighted on Achilles who was putting another bite in his mouth. I followed what he was looking at, curious as to why he stopped mid-sentence. He was looking at his wrists, or rather, the string marks that were left on them. I threw a palm on my forehead. \"Oh forget it,\" Theseus grinned at me. \"I know exactly how you lost yours.\" Then he paused and frowned, as if something piqued his curiosity once more, before muttering softly, \"Patroclus, you. Are you saying you went one-on-one against the Eumenides this morning right after you went one-on-one against Achilles last night? Where does all this stamina coming from?\" \"My liege, I would be very glad if you would allow me to hit you just once.\" We are now in Rhadamanthus' palace, with the ruler of Elysium sitting on his throne and with Theseus crouched on his knees, laughing. Rhadamanthus sighed long and hard, in a way that reminded me of Hades. \"What do you even do with necklaces?\" Behind us, I heard Theseus choked from giggling. The judge ignored him, \"I can't believe you lost yours Patroclus in less than a day. You're only meant to wear them. How could you lose something that's just hanging around your neck? And both of you at the same time?\" Achilles replied wearily, \"Like I've said, we took them off and they got lost in the sea.\" Rhadamanthus thumbed his temples, \"And now you're telling me that you have also lost the sea? So you can't find the Stones?\" \"We didn't lose the sea. How does anyone go around misplacing the sea?\" \"Achilles, you have misplaced an entire river.\" Achilles decidedly ignored him, \"This sea just pops in and out in our Elysium, you see, and it's not there now. We don't know when it will appear again.\" \"Then why did you have to toss the Stones out to the sea?\" I followed the brows that furrowed intensely on Rhadamanthus' forehead. I could tell he was really grappling to put two and two together. \"We didn't toss--why do you make it sound like we intentionally--no, I actually...I might have just actually tossed...\" Achilles turned at me and in that honest way he does, asked, \"I did actually...didn't I?\" Theseus wasn't even keeping up appearances anymore and was now laughing wildly. I tried not to get distracted and struggled to keep myself composed. \"My lord,\" I said, humbled and apologetic. I knew full well how important it is for the Elysium to remain as a picture of perfect paradise with its residents free from suffering. \"Let me--\" \"Us. Let us,\" Achilles snapped and gave me a look. I smiled. \"Let us take responsibility for it. If we have to go somewhere to replace them, please let us.\" Rhadamanthus regarded me carefully before finally walking to the small fountain at the corner of the throne room. He picked something from underneath the pool and he closed his fist around them. He approached us and wordlessly offered his closed hand. I reached an open palm underneath them and he handed me a new pair of stones. Except that this time they did not come as a pair of necklaces. It's a pair of gleaming moon white rings that is shaped like a wishbone at the center. \"It's the Rings of Hecate. Since they come as rings this time, please do not go out of your way to take them off.\" \"Thank you,\" I replied politely. \"They work like the stones you lost except that these ones do not rely on cheap tricks like projecting what others expect to see. It's a genuine spell of illusion.\" \"If you have something like this, why not give this right from the start?\" Achilles asked. \"Because no. 1, these rings only work as a pair. On their own, it's just a piece of rock. Patroclus initially did not need it. And no. 2, these rings are not originally created as an artifact to cast the spell of illusion such as hiding the scars of Tartarus. That's just something I asked the goddess to include.\" \"What does it originally do?\" \"It's supposed to be an amulet to bind your lover to you so they will not forget you especially if they are going away. According to the stories, Hecate once plucked the wishbone of an immortal bird, two pieces of bones that even if broken apart will inevitably fuse back together. Since she doesn't have a lot of immortal birds to pluck it from, eventually she made a spell that does the same thing and put them on these wishbone-shaped rings. It's apparently most effective if worn under oath on the night of a full moon. Hecate is said to preside over that oath on such a night.\" There was a brief silence. At least until Achilles and I broke it. I said, \"We don't need this--\" He said, \"We don't need this --\" We both looked at each other equally pleasantly surprised to know we were thinking the same thing. Then Achilles began to chuckle. I smiled. \"Oh my gods,\" I heard Theseus groan. \"Of course I know you don't need it,\" if Rhadamanthus could allow himself to condescend us by rolling his eyes, he would have. \"It won't work on you either because you're already bound by something else stronger than that. I just find them useful when it comes to you two since those rings are also bound to each other. If you lose one of them, you can use the other to find it.\" \"How?\" \"I don't know. But I don't encourage you to find out.\" \"What if we lost both of them?\" \"They have the power to find their way back to whoever they belong. Those rings will only fit you and only you and cannot be worn by anyone else. But please, don't try to test that.\" \"We won't,\" I declared. Rhadamanthus looked incredulous. \"On the event we fail, please know that at least we tried,\" I said again. \"Or at least, I tried.\" *** When we came back, the crowd in the pavilion had grown. Both the boatman Charon and the craftsman Daedalus found their way here, chatting amiably with Amphiaraus. The rest of the seven were rowdy and already drunk. Aesclepius, the greatest doctor who ever lived and died, of more renown than his father, killed by the gods for being powerful enough to raise the dead back to life, seemed--in something that felt revelatory to me--to be engrossed in a pleasant conversation with the God of Death, Thanatos. Zagreus, the Prince of the Underworld and Peneia, the unknown hidden child of Apollo were, for some reason, sulky and grumpy about something. I heard someone say, \"Are you seriously grilling meat on Hestia's hearth?\" To which the prince replied, \"It's fine isn't it? Hestia's fire never goes out. Also, she doesn't mind.\" \"Hold on, what are we celebrating again?\" I asked Theseus. \"Oh that,\" he gave Achilles a wreath of olives. \"Do him the honor, will you?\" Achilles unhesitatingly wreathed me the kotinos. I said, \"What is this for?\" \"As the victor of the fifth game of my Pentathlon.\" \"What? How come?\" \"You got Heracles on the last one so it was your victory.\" \"What--no--that wasn't!\" \"It's fine, it's fine. He conceded to you already. We're holding the awarding and the banquet now.\" \"You just want a reason to drink.\" \"And you should too. You should always find a reason to celebrate, Patroclus. The smallest, most insignificant ones are just as worthy of celebration as the biggest, most earth-shattering of reasons. Happiness are abound in this world just as much as suffering is. Don't let any of them just pass you by unnoticed,\" Theseus raised me a toast and cheered. \"And don't let suffering be all there is.\" I stared at him speechless. All this time and it is only at this moment that I am made to remember that this man had lived long enough before us, and is definitely older than us, and now also probably--gods help us all--potentially wiser than us. The evening progressed and everything felt like a whirlwind. Theseus joined those who were drinking and guzzling mead out of the amphora. Achilles and I found ourselves frying Heracles' pancakes and eating them. They were too sweet. \"My throat wants to scorch itself from the sweetness of this thing,\" Achilles took a few swigs of the sideritis brew in between his bites. He sniped a look at Heracles and screamed at the other table, \"Heracles! Why is the only thing that's sweet about you is your pancakes?\" I choked in between bites and started laughing uncontrollably. Zagreus, slightly tipsy now, shouted back in reply from across the pavilion, \"At least something about him is sweet! All I have is knives.\" \"Sucks to be you Prince,\" Achilles yelled in response. \"You won't say that if you aren't lucky enough to land Patroclus! Goddamn it. Born invincible then you fell for someone who also loved you back. That shouldn't be fair, is it?\" \"I worked on that brat!\" \"Is it that sweet?\" I heard Theseus say. Heracles pushed him a plate and he took a bite. \"That's about right, isn't it?\" Achilles groaned. Zagreus went back to grilling by the hearth and muttered sulkily, \"Yes, yes, I've got it already. No need to rub it in.\" Thanatos looked like he would rather be picking souls at the moment. Aesclepius came to pick one of those pancakes and gave a plate to Peneia who received them reluctantly but proceeded to eat them ravenously. \"Hecate's wishbone rings,\" he whistled when he saw the rings decorating the fingers next to our pinky. \"Mortals flock to the goddess praying for these exact rings. Depending on whoever wears them, they can either be a scourge or a gift.\" \"Why would it be a scourge?\" Achilles asked. \"Wishbone rings are oath rings. And an oath you don't intend to keep is nothing but a scourge. Which makes these rings completely redundant to you since you two are already soul-bound. Why do you have these?\" \"As replacement for the Stones of Rhadamanthus.\" \"What happened to the Stones?\" \"Please don't ask.\" Aesclepius stared at us and seemingly knowing what's good for him, did not pursue that question. His eyes fell on my heel. \"Oh that reminds me,\" he stooped down and grabbed my ankle to inspect it. \"Excuse me?\" said Achilles as if it was his ankle that was seized. \"Mmmm it grafted fully,\" the doctor mused. \"This is nice. At this rate, you won't probably need to replace it. Double-beings sure are full of surprises. And Achilles, please don't look at me like you intend to stab me and make it look like an accident. My staff is not meant to be used that way.\" Achilles drove the staff with the lone snake entwined around it to the soft earth where it buried itself. \"I don't intend to make it look like an accident.\" \"Let me have a look at you too.\" \"I don't--\" The doctor seized him by the ankle too despite his protest. I watched him examine Achilles' heel and a thought occurred to me. \"If you're around, would you mind teaching me?\" \"It's fine. His heel is fine. You won't have to worry about that. As for the gift of speed he lost, well, what is lost in River Styx can only be returned by the River Styx. Then again, being double-beings on par with the gods, why would you need it for--\" \"No, I mean, would you mind teaching me the healing arts?\" It came both as a surprise to both the doctor and Achilles. I looked at Achilles' heel, the tendon he destroyed and I remembered how back then he couldn't even walk. I remembered the scars on his back, the wounds that caused them and the poisons that debilitated him. I remembered how helpless all of that made me feel. I remembered about those who took advantage of him when he was at his most vulnerable. I remembered and remembered, and I thought: I want to be able to do this. \"Look, would you listen. Like I've been saying, why would you want to--\" \"Please,\" I said. Aesclepius sighed, \"Fine. I don't mind. It's not that hard.\" Then he turned at Achilles, \"See? That's how you get jealous. You get whoever makes you feel they are more qualified than you to teach you what makes them more qualified than you.\" \"No, I don't think you're more qualified than me when it comes to him at least.\" He ignored me, \"Man, I'm such a good catch it's almost a pity I already resigned myself to taking care of my brother from a different mother. Right, young Peneus?\" He turned around only to find the kid serving himself grilled meat from Zagreus' batch from Hestia's hearth. \"How about knowing his name for starters?\" I asked. The doctor followed his young brother where he began snatching the food off his plate. Meanwhile, Achilles has stopped eating and just kept on poking the hot coals sizzling on the griddle. \"May I ask why you are so guarded against Aesclepius?\" \"I'm not guarded against him. If we ever get into a fight--no, we can't--it would only look like I'm picking on him.\" \"But you glare at him pretty intensely more often than you do with, say, Theseus. I'm wondering if he did something to you.\" Achilles was silent that I thought he must not want to talk about it. I'm ready to wait for him but he spoke again, \"Because he's...he's...\" he looked like he wanted to swallow the words more than spit them out. \"Because he's definitely a good man,\" he finally said, frustrated to admit it. \"Better than me in many respects that you care about. Didn't you admire Chiron because he's a healer too? So much that now you also wanted to take up the art of medicine. Back in the army, you were more known by the people you saved than the people you killed. And I'm just...just...well, I'm the opposite of that...\" He continued, \"Aesclepius is a doctor, the greatest in fact. He has only saved lives. He never took them. He's everything that I am not. I mean, uh, what I'm saying is...\" You're saying you're jealous. Goddamn it. Seriously. I threw both palms on my face. I'll give you my soul if I have to. I'd rather burn hell than give up on you. I'd die by your hands if that will save you. And you're worried about the greatest doctor waltzing in and probably catching my eyes? \"Achilles,\" I said, desperately struggling to keep a straight face. \"You can't be this sinfully endearing all the time. It's bad for my heart and for my sense of reason.\" \"Huh?\" *** It was the darkness before dawn. Or at least what is left of it. Morning is on its way. I opened my eyes and woke up to the bodies that were strewn everywhere, either passed out drunk or just sleeping. Achilles was leaning on my shoulder. I found my hand on his. What I did not find however was the ring on his finger. I remember him going out of his way and tossing it out somewhere in the middle of the night last night while saying something along the lines of, \"Let's see if your ring can really find it.\" It hasn't even been a full day since the ruler of Elysium specifically told us not to test it and he has already thrown it to find out. That's just one of the things I love about him. My ring felt warm on my finger. It is also blinking, dazzling and dimming alternately. I held my hand up and forward and it went slower. I held my hand to my right and there was it again, blinking fast as if telling me to hurry up. I roused myself, kissed Achilles on the forehead and followed the ring that is searching for its pair. It brought me to one of the hills in our Elysium, one of the vantage points from where you can survey the fields below and beyond. It is unsurprising to me that Achilles was able to throw that high and far. I sifted through the earth, following my ring's signal. Until finally there it was, right by the fig tree, glinting like the first rays of the sunrise that is already peeking from the horizon, dramatic reds and orange already pouring from it, bathing our Elysium. I picked up Achilles' ring. \"Oh, you actually found it.\" I turned around, slightly surprised, \"Since when?\" \"Since you kissed me good morning. I've been stealthily following you.\" The sunrise tinged his cheeks warm orange. He smiled and its warmth coursed through me. I let it soaked me in. \"This here is really the best view to watch the sunrise.\" \"Did you throw the ring out here on purpose? Is this your way of inviting me to watch it together?\" \"Of course not,\" he said, trying to be wily and shy at the same time and perfectly pulling it off. \"I could just drag you out here if I want to.\" I gazed at him, light spilling on his face and I heard Aesclepius' words ring in my ears. Wishbone rings are oath rings. \"Achilles,\" I said, sunrise on his face, wind on his hair. I took his hand and slid the ring up his finger. \"We need no oath. We need no vows, but let me say it anyway.\" I kissed the hand that is wearing the ring and I declared. \"Let me take care of you for the rest of our time.\" Here in our afterlife, afterwards, a new sun rises for us. I gaze at the rings on our fingers, fingers that are entwined with each other. I begin to think about how these rings hold our secrets with us. About how they hide the scars we share. About the soul we share. He crinkled his nose and he looked like he was struggling to keep his tears from falling. I laughed. Achilles threw his arms around me tightly and wordlessly and I embraced him back. I took him in. All of him. And we both understood. I am half of him and he is half of me. We deserve a soft afterwards my love. We were once alive and we have suffered enough. END. There will be 6 short stories titled Epilogue of the Afterwards set after this three-part series. It will be about Patroclus just being the total badass of a boyfriend he is and bringing the day of reckoning to those who deserve it. A pun on The Ship of Theseus. Achilles and Patroclus being mentors to the Prince. And Queen Perse's very wholesome flower viewing invitation over a rather almost but not quite unwholesome reason. And on that note, see you soon!To all those who have read this, thank you for your time and generosity. If you enjoyed this fic even a little bit, I would be glad.",

      "It was eerily silent, or so I believe it was.",
      "The ringing in my ears seemed to drown out everything else, even the loudest silence.",
      "There were also flashes.",
      "White-hot headaches that traced themselves across my skull like lightning.",
      "Ever since Achilles collapsed in my arms, this high-pitched ringing has never stopped.",
      "I shut my eyes tight, forcing it out of my ears.",
      "It worked like my prayers to the gods.",
      "It did nothing.",
      "I opened my eyes again and there was someone--or something--staring and smiling malevolently at me from under the water.",
      "I felt my blood curdled deep in my bones as white and bony hands shot up from the swamp and locked their fingers around my head, their nails dug on my skull as they dragged me down.",
      "I seized those wrists and wrestled with them.",
      "It had rows of jagged teeth, whatever 'it' was, that snapped at me and I narrowly avoided having a chunk of my face bitten off.",
      "Then suddenly, 'it' started singing.",
      "The song was soothing and calm that it almost lulled me to stupor.",
      "Almost.",
      "I clawed on those hands that were seizing my head even tighter and with all the strength I could muster, I wrenched their hold on me until I was able to yank myself free.",
      "I fell on my back and 'it' scurried back into the swamp in a shriek of protest.",
      "\"That was impressive.\"",
      "I turned around in surprise.",
      "My body felt deathly cold.",
      "It was one thing to look at that thing face to face.",
      "It was another to have escaped from it.",
      "\"You were not pulled in.\"",
      "A young woman with a wicker basket has been standing a few steps behind me.",
      "She looked like she saw all of it and wasn't exactly a stranger to a scene like that.",
      "I stood up and said, \"I'm looking for the blind seer.\"",
      "\"That was a Stygian siren, you know.\"",
      "Stygian.",
      "I see now.",
      "This is why this place looked familiar.",
      "I am in the Stygian marshes.",
      "\"I see,\" I shrugged.",
      "\"Would you know if there's someone else residing here?",
      "Like someone who is blind and also a seer.\"",
      "\"There's supposed to be no one who can resist their song.",
      "They're peak temptress.",
      "Infamous seducers of men.\"",
      "With looks like that?",
      "I thought but did not voice it out.",
      "\"Well, they are supposed to look irresistible to you once you hear their song,\" she said, reading my mind.",
      "\"I'm looking for Tiresias.\"",
      "\"I know,\" she replied.",
      "\"So how did you do it?\"",
      "I gave up and indulged her, \"I couldn't hear it over the sound of my anxiety.\"",
      "\"That's unfortunate.",
      "If you can look past the fact that their song will sink you to oblivion, it is music.\"",
      "I clicked my tongue.",
      "It was his laughter that is music",
      "and I won't hear it again if I dawdle here.",
      "The woman stubbornly kept on, \"In fact there was a famous hero who wanted to listen to it so much that he asked to be tied to the mast of a ship so he won't be pulled in.\"",
      "\"If he wanted it so much, he should have just drowned in it.\"",
      "She looked at me quizzically before saying, \"But that's dangerous.\"",
      "\"Is it?",
      "If you found your home in the most treacherous depths, there is nothing much worse than to be left on the shores.\"",
      "\"Your home is in somewhere that dangerous?\"",
      "\"No.",
      "It's my home who makes the somewhere dangerous.\"",
      "\"Well, he can't because he had a wife to come home to.\"",
      "\"Is that so?\"",
      "\"More than that I'm impressed you managed to pull yourself free out of sheer will.",
      "I was about to bring a rope.\"",
      "\"With respect to his wife, some of us can afford better men,\" I said, \"Now, if can you point me to the direction of Tiresias I would be greatly thankful.\"",
      "\"Up,\" I followed her finger and there was indeed a hut on top of a small hill.",
      "She showed the way and I trailed after her.",
      "It was a short but muddy hike.",
      "Each step was toe-deep.",
      "She didn't seem to mind.",
      "In fact she looked so used to it that she wasn't even wearing sandals.",
      "It grew darker as we went up since we were getting further from the swamp with its sunken moon.",
      "\"Don't you have any light?\"",
      "I asked, wondering how she knew where she was going in this darkness.",
      "\"Ah, oh, hold on,\" she produced a lamp and lit it, as if she simply forgot and not because she didn't need it.",
      "\"Aren't you going to ask?\"",
      "\"Is it far?",
      "I don't have a lot of time.\"",
      "\"About the moon I mean.",
      "What is it doing there?",
      "Do you know whose it was?\"",
      "\"Not Artemis?\"",
      "\"No.",
      "It's the chariot of the Titan goddess of the moon Selene.",
      "It's her only chariot.\"",
      "Finally, we reached the hut.",
      "It was crude.",
      "Despite that, it seemed to have everything it needed.",
      "There was a rough kitchen, a tucked mattress by the wall, and an equally rough vegetable patch on the yard.",
      "It all seemed incomprehensible to me how they grew in this gloom and darkness.",
      "It was even more incomprehensible to me how she fared in all of this.",
      "She put her lamp down and fumbled at her own gates.",
      "It was curious.",
      "You should cast the light on your gates and not on your feet.",
      "I picked her lamp and pointed it to where her hands were.",
      "She said thank you even if she didn't look like she really used the help.",
      "\"Selene crashed it there and lost it forever,\" she said again.",
      "\"She did so in order to light someone's way out even if that meant she will lose her meaning as a god.",
      "She did it for a mortal.\"",
      "Maybe if it's someone like her, my prayers would actually work.",
      "\"She stopped being a god.",
      "Artemis took over that role,\" she replied, as if she divined what I just thought.",
      "\"I don't need a god.",
      "I would worship anyone and anything who can save him,\" I scanned the hut and found no one else in it, \"I'm going to ask one last time.",
      "Do you know where Tiresias is?\"",
      "\"Yes I do,\" she looked at me with eyes that reminded me of Achilles.",
      "\"And you come to me for advice.\"",
      "\"I am Tiresias, the blind seer,\" she said again at my quiet disbelief.",
      "\"I thought you're an old man.\"",
      "\"I am that too.",
      "I just went with this,\" she twirled around, \"It's nice when you have options.\"",
      "My quiet disbelief turned to a quiet confusion.",
      "\"Before I was blind and before I was a seer, I was first a woman.",
      "In fact, my becoming blind and a seer were uncanny consequences of me becoming a woman, which was in turn a consequence of, in equal proportions: curiosity, fear, and ignorance.\"",
      "Our stories spoke of the prophet Tiresias as a man of few words.",
      "I'm beginning to think that the Cloak of Alizarine might have finally broken down on me.",
      "\"But that doesn't explain why--\"",
      "\"It does explain everything Philtatos.",
      "Do you know that male snakes have spiked double penises?",
      "I didn't know that at the time when I chanced on a mating ball of snakes.",
      "It was a matter of curiosity at first except that they were having this steamy little tryst in the shed of some elderly woman living alone.",
      "I feared that they would make a nest there so as much as I understood that no one really appreciates being interrupted in the middle of it, I had to drive them away.",
      "Things went out of hand and I accidentally killed one of the female snakes.\"",
      "Tiresias was well-renowned as a seer who is incapable of being wrong.",
      "He was also well-renowned for being terse to the point of ambiguity.",
      "I don't know about the first part, but the latter part, I'm having doubts.",
      "\"Who would have thought that the gods were given to such voyeuristic proclivities that it was an offense to have interrupted that.",
      "I was turned to a woman as a punishment.",
      "I tried it for seven years.",
      "I even gave birth.\"",
      "\"And that made you a seer?\"",
      "\"No, but it made me qualified to settle the debate among the gods as to who experience more pleasure during intercourse, men or women, as someone who has been on both sides of the bed,\" she continued.",
      "\"To say women is to offend Hera.",
      "To say men is to offend Zeus.\"",
      "\"So you offended Hera.\"",
      "\"And I was struck blind.",
      "Zeus, on the other hand, gave me the gift of prophecy.\"",
      "\"But that doesn't explain why are you still a woman now.\"",
      "\"Oh that's only because those things down there seduce every man that comes.",
      "It's better if I stay like this.\"",
      "She looked at me briefly, turned around, and picked up a piece--or rather what looked like two pieces of shawl.",
      "She seemed to be in the middle of patching them together as there were two knitting needles at their seams and a ball of yarn trailing by the floor.",
      "One of them was more worn-out than the other but the color and the pattern of the two pieces looked like they were cut out of the same material.",
      "It did not look too odd to weave them together.",
      "\"Oh excuse my little art project,\" she said, as her hands began to work on the needles, loop after loop, the yarn went.",
      "\"I used to have a closet of epiblema but now I don't know where they all went.",
      "They often get snagged here and there that the yarn would come loose.",
      "Sometimes I would be too late to notice the frayed ends that I almost lost half of the material.\"",
      "It was almost hypnotizing to watch her deft fingers moved through the loops and knots.",
      "\"So, do you want to ask me what the future holds for you?\"",
      "\"No. I don't need to know a future I don't want to be in.",
      "I'm here to ask how to save Achilles' soul from the Glyph of Tartarus.\"",
      "She continued knitting for a while before finally asking, \"What did the doctor say?\"",
      "\"That he cannot cure him.\"",
      "\"How about the gods?\"",
      "\"That it is inevitable.\"",
      "\"Then what is the point of trying to stop it?\"",
      "\"Even so, I refused to give in to the inevitable.\"",
      "\"And you come to me?\"",
      "\"I find my hope where I can.",
      "Even from the depths of hell.\"",
      "\"How about the poets?\"",
      "\"What?\" \"What did the poets say?\"",
      "she glanced at me.",
      "\"If the doctor and the gods cannot help you, how about the poets?\"",
      "\"But what did the poets--\" He is half of my soul, as the poets say.",
      "\"Want to test that?\"",
      "she looked up from her work, as if divining the words that crossed my mind.",
      "\"No, no, that's just poetry.",
      "How could it--\" \"Exactly, isn't it?",
      "It's just poetry.",
      "At its best, poetry is only a glorified account of a past that didn't exist.",
      "At its worst, it is a reminiscence of an unremembered truth that dares not speak itself out loud.\"",
      "She studied my confusion before continuing, \"A long time ago, in a story older than the gods, it was once said that humans used to be double-beings, bearing one soul in two bodies.",
      "This 'oneness', a constitution of being whole and complete, the lack of want for anything else, a state of absolute satisfaction that defies the need for the deities, made humans powerful enough to rival the gods themselves.",
      "Zeus feared these humans.",
      "He feared that they would usurp power from the gods.",
      "Therefore, he cast a curse that separated the humans between themselves, halving their power as a result.",
      "From then on, humans will only inhabit their one body with their soul split in two.",
      "It was said that the part of their soul where the tear was made ached so much that humans couldn't do anything else but writhe agonizingly from their lost.",
      "Apollo took pity on them and sew these half souls on the seams where the wound was made.",
      "The navel was the remnant of where Apollo tied the knot.",
      "It was also the remnant of this ancient curse.\"",
      "\"And what happened to them?",
      "Their other half?\"",
      "\"You yearn for it.",
      "From then on, humans learned desire.",
      "The constant hunger for something more has never left them.",
      "Whether it's riches, glory, or fame.",
      "All in the hopes of filling the void their other half left.",
      "But they never work.",
      "Nothing truly ever did.",
      "This perennial state of dissatisfaction, the want of the coveted unknown, the search for what makes them human, whole, and complete made them vulnerable--and vulnerability seeks the gods.\"",
      "The ringing in my ears grew louder by the second.",
      "The white-hot shrill arced across my skull.",
      "I shut my eyes tight for a second.",
      "\"Humans can never find their other half again.",
      "Not when they're alive.",
      "Not even when they're dead.",
      "To do so is a feat greater than miracles,\" she continued.",
      "\"The other half of your soul.",
      "It's lost.",
      "Like one grain of sand washed by the sea.",
      "Humans subconsciously knew this, and have long settled with the nearest best substitute they can find, inventing ceremonies, rituals, contracts to bind themselves with, trying to become one with them, hoping to feel whole and complete again.",
      "And even on that impossible chance you find your true half back to you, you won't know for sure.",
      "You have long been numb from the ache.\"",
      "I, for one, certainly don't feel numb from it.",
      "I pound the base of my skull, \"And how does all of this talk going to save the only soul that I care about?\"",
      "She smiled, \"If he is really half of your soul, as the poets say, then the only thing that can save him from falling apart is your own soul.\"",
      "\"He can have it.",
      "What do I need to do?\"",
      "She seemed briefly surprised before shaking her head, \"No, not like that.",
      "Apollo did quite a good job sewing the seams but the Unravelling Curse is more powerful than that.",
      "It tugs on the loose ends created by Zeus' ancient curse.",
      "To stop it, you have to close the loose ends.",
      "In other words, you have to bind the two halves back.",
      "If you want a chance at saving Achilles' soul, you have to reverse the curse of the king of gods.\"",
      "\"And how do I do that?\"",
      "\"Don't you have fear?\"",
      "\"On what?\"",
      "\"You are risking to offend Zeus, the king of gods, for attempting to reverse his curse.\"",
      "I breathed in, \"I stand to lose Achilles, what else can I fear more?",
      "If Zeus will punish me with eternal grief in Tartarus then I'd rather have that than spend an eternal bliss not knowing him.",
      "So let me ask again, how do I do it?\"",
      "\"All of this out of a mere chance of saving him?\" \"I'll take it.\"",
      "\"I understand,\" despite the darkness, her eyes seemed to darken even more.",
      "\"You are not the one who can do it.",
      "However, it will be up to you if he will.\"",
      "\"Who?\" \"There's only one god who can reverse Zeus' ancient curse, Hades, ruler of the dead, god of souls.\"",
      "I unfolded the cloak on my hands, \"I need to know.",
      "What happens to him if the poets are wrong?\"",
      "\"You mean if your souls do not belong to the same whole?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"How about you?",
      "Are you only going to ask what happens to him?\"",
      "\"At this point, I can't really care about anyone else.",
      "So just tell me what happens to him.\"",
      "\"No mortal knows,\" she answered.",
      "\"Because that's the kind of mistake Hades wouldn't risk to make.",
      "And he would not risk it because one: gods cannot reverse the exact same curse of each other's.",
      "That was why even Zeus cannot reverse my blindness that Hera cursed me with.",
      "And two: because of what will happen should he agree to help you.\"",
      "My face turned white, \"What?\"",
      "\"Should he agree to help you, under the rage of Achilles, Hades will fall.\"",
      "I froze where I stood.",
      "Then she said next, \"And I don't mean the god.\"",
      "When I was alive, the realm of the dead was rarely ever called the Underworld.",
      "The name for the realm of the dead is synonymous to the name of the god who rules it, Hades.",
      "Therefore, should Hades agree to help me, the Underworld will fall.",
      "But why Achilles, why would he?",
      "\"But why--\" \"Prophecies beg no reason, Philtatos.\"",
      "I swallowed the words in my throat.",
      "Confused, I fumbled to don the Cloak of Alizarine once more.",
      "\"One last thing,\" she called, now engrossed at her knitting.",
      "\"It's not always the fastest route that brings you where you need to be.",
      "If you find yourself in a garden, then walk through it.",
      "It might be slow, but it is not wrong.\"",
      "No one really knows how to go to the palace of Hades and arrive.",
      "This is partially owing to the fact that no one really knows the direction to go there and wholly owing to the fact that the god is not keen about uninvited guests, especially if the guests are grumbling souls of the dead who are inclined to express their dissatisfaction in a rather dramatic fashion.",
      "Like, for example, by diverting one of the rivers of the Underworld.",
      "Being much of a god as the rest of the pantheon, Hades would not shy away from doling out consequences as any other god would.",
      "Except that with death, illnesses, and misfortune already out of the table, what with the dead having been there and done that, there were not just much to work with and to come up with something else equally effective would require more work than it's worth.",
      "This is why the god would rather avoid audience except for those he provided means to do so i.e. Theseus' Lamp of Skiamati or the Cloak of Alizarine.",
      "However, Achilles once swore that it is quite rather possible to brute force your way to finding Hades' palace if you trace any of the five rivers of the Underworld to its source.",
      "Although, if Theseus was to be believed, that was only because Achilles cleared all the monsters that met him along the way that the naiads in the rivers simply could not stand the bloody trail he was leaving so they voluntarily led the course of the river back to the palace.",
      "With Hades' palatial estate not being a common destination in the Underworld, it took me a while to realize what I was looking at when I arrived.",
      "I was at the foot of a cliff and on top stood what looked like the god's palace.",
      "A winding trail carved itself at the side of the cliff opening up to a dense forest and a muddy track.",
      "The lush colorful shrubs and vegetation surrounded it.",
      "I surveyed the face of the cliff and thought that while it might be difficult to scale, it was quicker and straightforward.",
      "Meanwhile, I'm not sure where the rambling trail would lead me.",
      "I grabbed a foothold and began climbing.",
      "Living in Mount Pelion, I have become used to scaling cliff faces such as this.",
      "A strong gust of wind beat my face, carrying leaves, petals and traces of varied floral scents.",
      "The scent of a garden.",
      "Rather than the verdant scent of lush green foliage.",
      "If you find yourself in a garden, then walk through it.",
      "I hesitated, then remembered.",
      "Tiresias is a prophet who is never wrong.",
      "I retraced my ascent, descended the cliff and headed to the trail.",
      "True enough, I found a beautiful garden in the middle of it.",
      "In fact, to call it beautiful is a gross understatement.",
      "I have never seen a field of flowers quite anything like this.",
      "There were blue, white, and red anemone and hyacinths, blue, purple, pink and white aster and bellflowers, pastel crocus, sweet pink carnations and peonies, bluish white delphinium, and white lotus and water lilies languidly drifting along the ripples on a pond.",
      "The garden showed off its colors as if it did not belong in the shadowy glum of the Underworld.",
      "In the middle of it stood a tree with flamboyant red flowers.",
      "Some of it have not blossomed and remained as red buds, while others have completely grown fruits, which I found strange.",
      "Usually the entire tree follows the same season but it seems that on this one, each flower follows a different season.",
      "As if the entire tree is on spring, summer, autumn, and winter all at once.",
      "It is a pomegranate tree.",
      "\"Oh?",
      "I haven't heard of a visitor coming today.\"",
      "It was the voice of woman.",
      "She had a wreath of flowers on her head and a cart in her hands, which she was pushing in front of her.",
      "In that cart were various garden tools such as sickle, scythe, rake, spade, shears and empty buckets.",
      "She might be one of Hades' maids who were taking care of this beautiful garden.",
      "\"Excuse me.",
      "I was just passing--er, no, I'm here for an audience with the god of the dead.\"",
      "\"I see.",
      "This way then,\" she led me and I cast one final glance at the tree.",
      "\"Strange isn't it?",
      "As if the flowers don't agree among themselves whether to bloom or not.\"",
      "\"Why?\"",
      "\"Because it's not up to them.\"",
      "She studied me for a while before continuing, \"This tree is a receptacle of memories.",
      "It takes its nourishment from the memories of anyone who will touch it.",
      "The fuller someone's memories are, the more vibrant and flamboyant the flower becomes.\"",
      "As if to show an example, she picked a stem with a red bud.",
      "The moment her fingers touched its stem, the bud blossomed, spreading its delicate red petals in full bloom.",
      "She smelled it briefly, smiled, and returned it to the branch she picked it from.",
      "It magically grafted itself back to the tree.",
      "\"See?",
      "It is grown from someone's memories.",
      "So long as there is someone who remembers, the flower will never wither.",
      "So long as someone remembers, the flower will never forget.",
      "It is as eternal as the afterlife.",
      "The flower will continue to bloom or bear fruit in a beautiful reminiscence of the memories it blossomed from.\"",
      "My throat felt dry.",
      "If I touch them, will they remember Achilles?",
      "Will they also bloom in a beautiful reminder of him?",
      "Or will they also wither miserably in the absence of him?",
      "\"These are mostly grown from the memories of the souls from the Fields of Asphodel,\" she said.",
      "\"A lot of souls condemned to forget have memories they don't want to lose.",
      "After all, not everybody can be allowed to wander in their afterlife with their memories intact.",
      "However, for those without a choice, this is the least we can do for them.",
      "Whenever they see how beautiful the flower has blossomed from their memories, the more they can let it go.",
      "They peacefully leave behind memories of their lives knowing that someone out there, in the land of the living or the dead, remembers the stories they once lived.",
      "And that is enough for them.\"",
      "But Achilles will not even have that.",
      "There will be no one left to remember him.",
      "I stared at the tree, grown from the memories of the dead who once lived.",
      "It is unfair, I thought.",
      "This is unfair.",
      "I pinched my eyes between my thumb and index finger, I don't know, maybe because I have been struggling not to bawl my eyes out.",
      "\"Then what happens to a flower that holds memories no one no longer remembers?\"",
      "She paused and looked at me, \"It disappears.\"",
      "I clawed at my head.",
      "I don't know if it was the heat behind my eyes or the buzzing in my skull that did it",
      "but I felt tears rolled down my cheeks.",
      "I wiped them right away.",
      "I'm running out of time.",
      "\"Young man, you look utterly terrible.\"",
      "\"I'm about to lose someone very important to me and I would need the help of Hades to save him.",
      "But I don't know if the god would even consider it.\"",
      "\"Don't worry.",
      "You have my word that he will help you.\"",
      "She smiled, and it was like the breath of spring, a breath of hope.",
      "***",
      "The lady accompanied me to an underground walkway where we emerged to the throne room.",
      "The familiar, dark cloaked figure who gave me Achilles' three-hundred year receipt came into view.",
      "Hades was not happy to see me.",
      "\"I knew one day you'll come to me about this.",
      "Theseus should have already told you.\"",
      "\"He did.\"",
      "\"Then--\" \"I had been to Tiresias.\"",
      "The god paused, and a disgruntled look, \"That physician again is it?\"",
      "He addressed my wariness pensively, \"So?",
      "What did the blind prophet say?\"",
      "\"That I only have one chance of saving him but I would need your help.\"",
      "\"I thought Theseus already told you.",

      "I caught myself in a panic and mustered all the strength from my limbs to climb over it only to get dragged deeper and deeper until the water grew dimmer and dimmer, as if arms suddenly erupted from the riverbed and were pulling me down, the meager light from above unable to penetrate these depths.",
      "To be honest, if I needed air to breathe, I have long fainted and drowned.",
      "But this time it wasn't the lack of air that was to be blamed.",

      "It throbbed gently at first, a finger tap on a wooden table, then wildly the next, a battering ram across the gates.",
      "Until finally it gave way.",

      "the water whispered.",
      "Or perhaps it wasn't the water that whispered it.",
      "Perhaps it was a voice in my head.",
      "Or a piece of the past that has fallen of.",
      "I shook my head, as if that would make all of the jagged pieces fall off and show me a picture, the picture.",
      "It felt incredibly important.",
      "It felt maddeningly urgent.",

      "And it tastes nothing.",
      "I was drifting right at the lip of a whirlpool, close enough to be drowned in but far enough to avoid myself from getting caught in it.",
      "I swam frantically, the currents propelling favorably on my direction, as if it suddenly decided to help me, bringing me back to safety, to land.",
      "I heaved myself up to the banks, drenched, every inch of me freezing.",
      "The only thing that was piercingly hot was the sharp stabbing pain in my temples.",

      "The piece that refuses to burn.",
      "And it is a name.",
      "The name is Achilles.",
      "\"Achilles,\" I muttered to myself.",
      "It felt strangely familiar and strangely foreign.",
      "\"Achilles.",
      "Achilles,\" I repeated, as if the name knows how well it rolls down my tongue.",
      "It was all I could remember.",
      "It was all I have.",
      "But it felt like it was everything.",
      "Was that my name?",
      "No.",

      "Gods and goddesses.",
      "They were frowning and definitely not happy.",

      "I was so confused that I didn't even bother to ask why.",
      "I held it between my fingers.",
      "They were looking at it expectantly.",
      "But nothing happened.",
      "Her face turned grim and worried.",
      "The god clicked his tongue and spun on his heels, turning his back at us.",
      "He mumbled some words as if issuing orders to the lingering shadows.",
      "One of the goddesses who was wearing a translucent white tunic snorted.",
      "I steadied myself in an effort to stand up.",
      "Every inch of me was numb from the cold and weighed down by my clothes.",
      "It felt heavier than it should be which seemed ironic to the searing emptiness I was feeling.",
      "As if I dropped something in the water.",
      "I looked back longingly at it, on the waves that rise and fall, dull in some places and surging in others.",
      "\"I have sent the seven to guard all the gates,\" the god said.",
      "\"Truthfully, we should more than be able to fend him off.",

      "He glanced at me and I stared back at him blankly.",
      "He looked ragged as if he went through a lot just to find his way here.",
      "\"He's here,\" he told the god.",
      "The god sighed.",
      "I want to know what's wrong.",
      "What's happening.",
      "Why do they all look that everything is ending?",
      "But at the same time I am afraid to ask, for whatever it is, it seemed I had a lot to do with it.",
      "Part of the cave had collapsed.",
      "Chunks of rocks fell in the water.",
      "A ray of light peeked in from the outside.",
      "The cracks branched out further like webs until a bigger section gave way.",
      "Something--or rather, someone limped from the hole on the wall that was punched opened, oblivious from the stones that have been falling on him.",
      "Bloodlust lurked in those eyes, darting around the cave like a lion in search of its prey.",
      "His gaze fell on me.",
      "And I met those eyes.",
      "There he was, his frame silhouetted against the light, and his eyes.",
      "Oh.",
      "Gleaming pools of emeralds, scandalously beautiful at the merest touch of light.",
      "I shuddered at the sight of it.",
      "He hobbled at my direction slowly at first, as if he couldn't believe it.",
      "Relief soaked his face.",
      "Then he began dashing towards me, limping and dragging his heel behind him.",
      "It was bleeding but it did not slow him down at all.",
      "He threw his arms around me and tackled me to the ground.",
      "We fell together, one pair of arms securely wrapped on the other, and another pair of arms flailing on air, confused on where to put themselves.",
      "There was another man that came after him and he looked equally battered, a huge bandage rolled around his chest.",
      "He was inscrutably studying me, as if waiting for me to do something.",
      "Whatever it was.",
      "\"Patroclus! Patroclus!\"",
      "the man who tackled me to the ground sobbed.",
      "He was clasping something on his chest.",
      "Something glowing.",
      "It looked appallingly painful, as if it has been burning its way through him.",
      "A circular rune of malevolent crimson.",
      "Except that the circle has not yet fully closed itself, two lines about to touch.",
      "Ouch.",
      "I sucked air through my teeth.",
      "Inside my head was a hiss.",
      "Like something had just fizzled out.",

      "He turned to me again, tears flowing on those cheeks.",
      "\"No, no, no, no,\" he wept and wept and wept as realization struck him.",
      "My heart gave way with it.",
      "\"Please, please.",
      "Don't...Don't forget me.",
      "No, no, please.\"",
      "I thought: there is nothing I'd rather remember than this man.",

      "\"Not yet.",
      "Don't give up on me just yet.\"",
      "And then: I'd rather see Hell burn than give up on you.",
      "Oh I see.",

      "\"Now I can wipe these tears off for you.\"",
      "I held up the branch of the pomegranate flower bud in my hand and watched its petals unwrap themselves in their fluttering beautiful reds, slowly and gracefully, as if it knew it had an audience to mesmerize.",

      "5 Chapters without Achilles.",
      "The dark, dark times.",
      "In fact after Hades said 'It's done', four things began to happen at once that my own brain fumbled about what to notice first.",
      "One: The glowing rune on Achilles' chest has disappeared.",
      "Two: My left heel began bleeding, accompanied by a dull throbbing.",
      "Three: My back felt itchy and slightly painful.",
      "Four:",
      "And oh, my left eye seemed to have lost its sight.",
      "Which now makes me half-blind.",
      "Might have been one of the negative side effects of Hades' curse reversal.",
      "I did not fuss about it.",
      "After all, it wasn't like I asked Hades for a full disclosure of the consequences.",
      "I decided to keep mum about it.",
      "At least for now.",
      "Achilles would not be happy to learn about it.",
      "Except that it didn't seem it would be willing to wait that long.",
      "Achilles fumbled on my face, brushing his fingers on every inch of my skin, staring at me intently.",
      "He seemed like he has been seeing me for the first time in forever--which he is.",
      "\"Oh, oh!\"",
      "he yelled in disbelief.",

      "\"Your soul is no longer in danger of unraveling, Achilles.",
      "As it is now bound to its half.",
      "No loose threads to tug on.",

      "I sighed.",
      "To be honest, it was no big deal to me.",

      "\"No! Why does he have to--those were things I did!",
      "I should be the only one who should suffer for it.\"",
      "\"LISTEN UP BRAT!\"",
      "Hades' voice boomed in the cave.",
      "We all flinched and were reminded that he is a god, brother of Zeus, one of the rulers of the three realms.",
      "Few more rocks were dislodged from the crevices due to the shock.",
      "Achilles, laudably and silently, held the god's furious gaze.",
      "\"Would you cut it out already?",
      "You should be thankful he's only getting away with an eye, some scars, and a heel!",
      "He was prepared to lose much, much worse!\"",

      "\"Well, I am most profoundly flattered, my lord,\" another man with long red hair tied in a ponytail and a huge scar on his chest appeared just behind Heracles.",
      "\"But we both know that it is impossible for those whose flesh have long returned to dust.",
      "Sadly even talents such as mine are not enough to alter the inevitable.\"",
      "He then regarded me, \"Thankfully you have something more than that.",
      "Well, I'm glad you didn't meekly listen to us when we told you to give up, Patroclus.\"",
      "It was a little validating to hear him say that.",
      "It has just begun to sink in to me that I actually succeeded.",
      "I won this time.",
      "This time I'm the one who gets him.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "I heard all about your little advice on visiting Tiresias,\" Hades shot back at Aesclepius.",

      "\"You mean the 'little' gamble that put the entire Underworld at stake?\"",
      "Aesclepius chuckled innocently, \"To say the 'entire Underworld' is too much of an exaggeration, isn't it?",
      "Not even a single blade of grass from Asphodel has been touched.\"",
      "We blinked blankly at him.",
      "He blinked back equally blankly at us.",
      "Finally Heracles offered, \"Apart from the castle, everywhere else is fine.\"",

      "\"Patroclus,\" the god said calmly.",
      "\"What did you say the words of the prophet were?\"",
      "\"Under the rage of Achilles...\" What was it?",
      "Tiresias did not actually say the Underworld herself, didn't she?",
      "\"Hades will fall?",
      "And not the god, she said.\"",
      "\"Those were the exact words?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "I saw Theseus twitched from the corner of my eye and muffled his face to stifle himself from bursting out laughing.",
      "Even Persephone turned around to hide herself from giggling.",
      "Aesclepius feigned a cough while trying to be civil about it and Heracles remained as deadpanned Heracles.",
      "Only Lethe and Hades remained stiffly frustrated and they were not seemed very inclined to explain to me why.",
      "Achilles, the love of my life, gods bless him, was rather pouty and sulky about it.",

      "\"Listen up Achilles.",
      "You're wonderful and all that, but no, I wouldn't put it past you to do just that.\"",
      "Theseus laughed even harder he crouched on his knees.",
      "Finally, it was Aesclepius who deigned to enlighten me of the error of my ways.",
      "\"Well, you're a newly-minted ghost Patroclus so you aren't probably aware of this yet but I know that in the land of the living, when they say 'Hades', it means both the god and the realm he rules, but here, when the dead says 'Hades', then it means both the god and his estate, specifically the castle, the entire palatial grounds.",
      "The dead just calls the Underworld, 'Underworld'.\"",

      "\"Trivial?\" snapped the god testily.",
      "\"Compared to the entire realm of the dead, I mean.\"",
      "\"Maybe that was not the prophecy,\" suggested Persephone.",
      "\"I heard Tiresias has been shaking things up in the trade.",

      "Was that it?",
      "Was that the metaphor all along and she wasn't actually just knitting for the sake of it?",
      "The metaphor was the prophecy?",

      "but I bet it also never happened before.",
      "\"And why would he need to work for you?",
      "Why would he owe you?\"",
      "I could see a nerve or two popped on Theseus' head, \"Have you seriously forgot the room you thrashed?\"",
      "Oh.",
      "Achilles hissed, \"I would make you a new bed in all kinds of olive tree you want.",
      "Does that make you happy?\"",
      "\"And who do you think paid for all the bets placed in the last game?",
      "He will pay your share too.\"",

      "\"Then take him!\"",
      "he declared.",

      "The tag is inaccurate,\" and now finally thinks, \"7 chapters in then the creator remembers,\" welp apologies.",
      "But as Patroclus would like to say, it's pretty hard to make out when your partner is under the threat of total non-existence so he must first figure that one out.",

      "I didn't mind it all.",
      "It didn't work.",
      "I told him that it was a cheap bargain in exchange for his soul.",
      "It also didn't work.",
      "I convinced him that it hardly hindered me at all.",
      "It was hardly convincing.",

      "but he did not.",

      "It was Rhadamanthus, ruler of Elysium, son of Zeus, and brother of Minos and Sarpedon.",
      "The same Sarpedon who died on my hands.",

      "\"Uh, will there be any adverse repercussions?\"",
      "I asked.",

      "\"No. I mean genuinely adverse repercussions.\"",
      "\"You mean the kind that are adverse only to Achilles?\"",
      "\"No,\" Achilles cut in, his voice could bend steel.",
      "\"He means aside from his eye, the scars, and the broken heel.\"",
      "\"I don't know.",

      "So, except maybe for a few obvious things.\"",
      "\"Like what?\"",
      "\"As already demonstrated, both blessings and curses are shared.",

      "It will be for anyone who sees it to say, gods and mortals alike.",
      "You share a bond as ancient as the gods.",

      "\"Philtatos, you remember why Zeus split humans from their halves in the first place, don't you?\"",

      "I have always been a threat to anyone, the living, the dead, gods, mortals.",
      "What changed?\"",
      "Gods, that cheek in that mouth of his.",
      "And I love him for it.",
      "\"Yes, and that's you Achilles,\" Rhadamanthus replied.",
      "\"Nothing much might have changed for you.",
      "But we are yet to see what it is for your half.\"",
      "It was all baffling but I have had a lot to deal with recently.",
      "Achilles is here with me and nothing else matters.",
      "\"Let's not keep you then,\" we politely saw him off.",
      "*** It was late afternoon in our Elysium.",
      "I don't know how long we were gone but it did not seem like we had any unwelcomed visitors.",
      "No visible harpies perched among the trees.",
      "\"Oh it is back,\" Achilles exclaimed.",
      "The beach of sprawling fine white sand, the glittering sea rolled out before our view, extending out to the horizon, emptying to gods know where here in the Underworld.",
      "Despite what Achilles may say about his mother, he could never truly hide his excitement whenever the sea appears.",
      "It's always on his face, like a paint that refused to be peeled off, that childish delight, that sort of vague reminiscence of his youth.",
      "He ran towards the beach.",
      "I kept my eyes peeled on him, even if only one of them can see him, it has no problem watching, taking in the sight of him so intently that I could almost feel the wind that brushed his hair, the taste of salt on his skin.",
      "This is what I would be missing if I gave up, and suddenly it hurt.",
      "My stomach squeezed inside me at the mere of thought of it.",
      "It was hard and scary and it all felt too hopeless, but Achilles is here and",
      "oh.",
      "He's here and it is all worth it.",
      "He's here and it's everything.",
      "My knees buckled under me and before I knew it, I was crying I almost couldn't believe it.",
      "As if all the pent-up emotions I dammed up inside because I don't have the time to go through them just swelled and broke through all my defenses.",
      "All of it.",
      "My insecurities, my fears, the pain of losing him again--all of it just bubbled in my chest, begging to be felt.",
      "Suddenly my tears were pouring on my cheeks and spilling on the sand.",
      "I'm glad.",
      "I'm so thankful I did not let him go.",
      "I don't care how many things I gave up when I was alive, slipping through my fingers as if I never deserve any of them, my mother, my father, my name, my home, my future.",
      "But this time--this one time when it matters, this one time when it meant the world to me, I'm so glad I hold on to it.",
      "And I will keep holding on to it, no matter what it cost me.",
      "\"Patroclus!",
      "The water feels good!",
      "Let's--WHAT'S WRONG?\"",
      "he came running to me, his face dissolving into panic as he saw me crying.",
      "\"Something is wrong after all?\" his voice trembled.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" I touched his arm, smiling, reassuring him.",
      "\"I'm fine.",
      "Nothing is wrong.",
      "I'm just really, really relieved.",
      "It's all just coming to me now.",
      "I was on the verge of losing you again--and that's--\" Oh gods, I really couldn't stop crying.",
      "\"That's really terrifying,\" I sobbed.",
      "\"The idea of not being able to see you again, even as a ghost...I can't stand it.\"",

      "I could smell the sea on him.",
      "\"I'm sorry...",
      "I'm sorry...",
      "It was all because of me,\" he kissed my hair, my forehead, the corner of my eyes, as if to soothe me.",

      "I'm here.",
      "You brought me back to you.\"",
      "I returned his embrace, burying myself into him, yes, yes, just like this tall wave which is about to bury us in three...two--uh.",
      "The tide surged and fell, crashing into us and drenching us both.",
      "We both fell into laughter.",
      "To be honest, I would rather us be back in the cave right now, back to its warmth, our bed lying just under the stars.",
      "That's what I would rather.",
      "But Achilles is now dripping wet in front of me, the fabric of his chiton sticking on his skin, showing what lies underneath, the smooth lines of his sinews, then there is that supple neck of his and those shoulders attached to it, those well-sculpted collarbones just underneath, the protrusion on his throat that I know how to tease out of him, and all the things I can do with them.",
      "I would rather us back in the cave right now.",
      "But here he is in my arms, a beauty like no other, criminally perfect, endlessly endearing.",
      "And there's pretty much nothing I can do about it.",
      "I pulled him by the back of his head and I squeezed our mouths together, which is as inelegant as it sounds, but nothing about what I feel right now is even remotely elegant.",
      "I slipped him the tongue",
      "and he just melted.",
      "He returned my kisses, twisting his tongue this way and that, in that way he knows best, which is rough and ravishing.",
      "\"I want you,\" I gasped, dazed.",
      "He chuckled, \"I heard you the first time.\"",
      "His fingers are all over me and my lips are all over him.",
      "I can feel his fingertips on my scalp, combing through my hair.",
      "I am at his throat, right beneath the chiseled curve of his jaw, gliding my lips through it, kissing his neck, the length of his shoulders which readily flush red at the merest graze.",
      "He stares at me.",
      "He has been staring at me a lot.",
      "Then I remember that until a while ago he cannot see.",
      "I only didn't feel that much difference because he put the work to make it seem that nothing changed.",
      "He did all of it so I can continue to be with the Achilles in my memories, the unblemished, invincible Aristos Achaion, and not the one who cannot walk without an artificial tendon attached to him, not the one with all those whip scars on him, and definitely not the one who cannot even see the man he has been waiting all this time.",
      "\"I miss seeing this look on you,\" he whispered.",
      "\"What look?\"",
      "\"The look that says how much you want me.",
      "I have been trying to imagine it all this time.\"",
      "\"Then go on and take a long hard look...at the face of a man who is drowning with desire for you.\"",
      "We felt so heady and floaty that I don't think I'll be able to recount even with a cool head how we found ourselves drifting in the sea.",
      "I was beneath the water when I went down on him.",
      "My hands on his hips, his hands on my head.",
      "I let my hands wander around him.",
      "That dip on his waist, the shallow grooves by the side of his abdomen, that part of his stomach where his navel had been.",
      "The inside of his thighs.",
      "Since I cannot see his face, I can only tell how I am doing by the way his fingers run themselves on my head, or the way his body curls or the way his hips slowly thrust.",
      "I want to feel him.",
      "I want to feel him when he peaks.",
      "But just before that, I am yanked off the water by the two hands on my head, and kissed--kissed as if all the kisses we had before were never enough.",
      "I kiss him back, two bodies sharing the same soul bobbing up and down with the tides.",
      "Slight annoyance darts on his face as the water stubbornly insists on disrupting us.",
      "He brings his hands on my shoulders, and we both dive down and deep, so now we are both underneath the waves where the currents are calmer and more steady.",
      "We are a tangle of limbs.",
      "I lock my arms around him and his arms go over my shoulders and around my neck.",
      "We do not care about where we are or how deep we have been swimming.",
      "We cannot see anything else but each other.",
      "One soul that has been aching for its half for as long as it can remember.",
      "One soul that is filling itself whole.",
      "One soul that finally feels complete.",
      "We come out to the surface gasping not for air but for each other.",
      "The sand is soft and comfortable.",
      "We crawl back up to the beach, him sitting on that space between my folded knees while I sit cross-legged, his back turned at me.",
      "We are both wearing the Stone of Rhadamanthus so we remain blind to the reminders of Tartarus.",
      "I lick his nape, alternating between biting and kissing.",
      "His hair dripping beads of water on his shoulders did nothing but only make them more enticing.",
      "He clasps my forearm, unable to tangle his fingers in any of the fingers from both of my hands because they are both busy pinching and kneading other places.",
      "I fondle him with one hand, with the other around his thigh, his body pressed against mine.",
      "I can feel his heat, his pleasure, as he arcs and twitches, his sweetest moans skipping him.",
      "\"Pa...Patroclus...I'm...\" I twirled his face towards me by his chin and mumbled, drawing a breath so close to his lips he trembled, \"Then come for me Achilles.\"",
      "I sealed his lips as he spilled himself in my hand.",
      "\"Just me again,\" he complained.",
      "\"You really don't have to do this,\" I said, as I watched him peering at me from between my legs.",
      "\"Wow, who is saying that?\" he grinned.",
      "\"I have been feeling this grinding at my back since earlier.\"",
      "He puts on his cat smile and keeps his eyes fixed on me, a pair of royally elegant emerald and warm melted chestnut.",
      "I helplessly throw a hand over my face.",
      "Oh his fluttering eyes and his pretty little mouth and all the things he does with them.",
      "\"Hnghh momnning hnor fmes...\"",
      "\"Please do one thing at a time Achilles.\"",
      "\"No covering your face.\"",
      "Then he added, \"Especially now that I can see it.\"",
      "I did as I was told and watch him.",
      "I could feel the air caught in my lungs.",
      "My toes curl and bury themselves underneath the sand, painfully aware of how good the fine grains felt on my skin, painfully aware of how good it all felt.",
      "He fixed me with a gaze that held me where I sat.",
      "He pins my knees on my side, with him wedged between them.",
      "I look at him and I gulp down at the sight of him.",
      "I swallowed hard and he looks like he wants to follow my throat down my neck.",
      "I cradle his cheek with a palm, and he nuzzles with it.",
      "I groan.",
      "I am not there yet.",
      "He did not bring me there.",
      "He knows what he is doing, pushing me right to the edge, just close enough to fall without having to jump.",
      "My eyes caught a table of shale carved not too far from us, waves crashing beneath it.",
      "Smooth layered claystone, wide and circular, punctured with holes in places that are filled by water.",
      "It looks perfect to me.",
      "\"Hey!\" he protested as I dragged him along.",
      "Until he saw where I was bringing him.",
      "\"Oh sweetheart.",
      "Should I worry on what you intend to do to me there?\"",
      "\"No such thing.",
      "But you should at least be prepared to beg.\"",
      "I throw him above it and he lies flat on his back.",
      "I followed him and climbed on top of the stone as well.",
      "\"Strip,\" he ordered, high and mighty.",
      "He sees how hard I was.",
      "He giggles.",
      "\"Who's going to beg now?\"",
      "\"Tease.\"",
      "I slung his leg over my shoulder and I suck at the skin by his thigh, bruising it carefully, one after another, an inch after inch closer.",
      "He watches me as I go through all the motions of it.",
      "He keeps his mouth behind the back of his hand, stifling all the noises that comes from it.",
      "Then he reaches out for my hand with his free hand and brings it in his mouth, licking the fingers on it, his tongue darting in and out of each them, wetting them one by one.",
      "Sometimes when I caught myself in that space between solid clarity and high-strung madness, I almost cannot bring myself to believe we can be like this, that we can be allowed to be like this.",
      "This would be unimaginable when we were alive.",
      "Sunset at the beach.",
      "The waves crashing beneath us.",
      "Right under the open sky, in the middle of the open sea.",
      "As if we are compensating on that time we were on a beach and just his lips brushing against mine sent us scurrying away out of fear that his mother might see, that the gods might see, or that anyone might see.",
      "But him right here with me, a trembling heap of pleasured mess.",
      "There is almost something unspeakably transgressive about it and all of that only makes the blood pound louder in my ears.",
      "I push a finger in and he yelps slightly.",
      "I twist his body to his side.",
      "I can reach in deeper this way.",
      "He tenses, as if bracing himself.",
      "Then the second finger in, up to the second knuckle, then the third.",
      "\"I want you without the Stone,\" I said.",
      "To be honest, he never really needed to hide those scars from me.",
      "It does nothing to how much I desire him.",
      "But this is something I don't ask of him often because I know it still bothers him and also because I don't want to remind him of what he had been through before I arrived.",
      "I kiss his hand, \"You know how I want you just the same.\"",
      "He hesitates but nods, \"Only if you also remove yours.\"",
      "I slid it off my neck.",
      "He tugged at his own necklace swiftly and surely, then carelessly chucked it somewhere.",
      "\"How about revenge?\"",
      "he offers his wrists to me, pressed to each other as if bound.",
      "I suck the air through my gritted teeth.",
      "He laughs.",
      "I am a taut string.",
      "He knows it and he relishes tugging at me harder.",
      "I indulge him and I bind his hands with the string of my necklace, the Stone dangling from it.",
      "I pin those wrists with a single hand over his head.",
      "I look at him and I savor the image of him like this.",
      "The stretch of muscles that wrap themselves around his ribs, drawn out tighter with his arms above his head.",
      "The tough and flexible sinews behind his upper arm, tensing and flexing at each movement.",
      "He props himself slightly and hoops his bound arms around my head and pulls me down and close, his lips brushing my ear, both of his legs hooking themselves below my hips.",
      "Now it is his turn to kiss the scars on my body.",
      "\"Show me how you want me,\" he whispered.",
      "I glided my hands underneath, lifting his chiton with it.",
      "My touch leaks the moans from his throat.",
      "I bore down on him, my body pressed on him, our hips grinding at each other.",
      "He dug at the skin on my back, cutting our teeth on pleasure we are learning from each other's body, as if what we had all this time was never enough.",
      "My thumb seared against his temples, sweat and water mixed, I cradled his head between my hands and brought his lips to mine, tucking his body in.",
      "I hemmed and sawed.",
      "To say I drank him in will never be enough.",
      "I want him the way Tantalus wants to drink water, the way he wants to taste that fruit.",
      "Except that unlike Tantalus, I can drink my water and taste the fruit",
      "and I will still be left in wanting.",
      "We felt the strength left our bodies, satiated, two half-souls who finally found each other.",
      "You know what they say.",
      "There are two kinds of friends in this world: casual ones who decided to read this fic because they couldn't sleep at night and couldn't find anything else that would bore them more.",
      "Then serious ones who think they are gourmet of erotic fic writing whose feedback to me can be pretty much summed up with, \"not enough positions.\"",

      "We've seen the things he did and we know the things he can do.",
      "Achilles is a drawn out sword that you can see coming, but Patroclus...that's the thing.",
      "He's a sword too but you won't know that until his blade is already under your rib.\"",
      "\"So this is what it means on having both curses and blessings shared?\"",
      "Hades nodded, \"He is now every bit of a warrior as Achilles.",
      "To say the Underworld now have a pair of Aristos Achaion wouldn't be wrong.\"",
      "\"That sounds fun.\"",
      "\"Extremely,\" Hades tried to smile to indulge his wife but he really couldn't pull the corner of his lip high enough.",
      "\"Achilles is an invincible half-god to begin with and now with Zeus' curse undone, they also reverted back as double-beings, which is something the king of gods himself feared, powerful enough to rival us should they wish to.",
      "And I doubt they even realize any of that.\"",
      "\"Hmm, Patroclus?\" the goddess paused, tilting her head.",
      "\"He's pretty much done thinking after the glyph of Tartarus disappeared on Achilles.",
      "And um, Achilles...nope...",
      "he's always been powerful and all that.",
      "I don't think he does a lot on any of those things: notice, realize or think.",
      "Impulse drives him and that pretty much sums up his life and afterlife.\"",
      "I was gliding through the hall, peering at a room.",
      "I feel like I keep hearing something important that I will forget later on.",
      "Hades pinched that space on his forehead between his brows, \"They are Hell's most problematic power couple to be honest and just the thought of having to babysit them for the rest of time is already making me tired.\"",
      "\"You worry too much dear.\"",
      "\"I think I should.",
      "One of them already altered the landscape of Hell as he pleased, flouted the rules, breached Tartarus, and destroyed a castle.",
      "While the other wouldn't even bat an eye in razing it all down for the sake of one soul--and all of that, back then when they were still something not akin to a god.\"",
      "\"But all of that, back then, were because they were threatened to lose the other.",
      "If anything, you should worry less about it now because their souls have been bound.\"",
      "Then she added, rather unnecessarily, \"I bet right now they are melting into each other's heat they couldn't even think about anything else, much less the things you were worrying about.\"",
      "\"Uh, I really don't need to be reminded of that.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?",
      "It's beautiful.",
      "I'm planning to invite them over for a flower viewing and have them tell me all about it.",
      "I bet they can't refuse me.",
      "I'm their top patron.\"",
      "This is also one of the things he loves about her.",
      "Now that she mentioned about flower viewing, Hades said, \"I've been meaning to ask, but what's up with the potted pomegranate?\"",
      "\"Oh,\" Persephone seemed to have forgotten about the plant either.",
      "\"This is what has become of the flower Patroclus grew.\"",
      "\"That?\" \"Yes.\"",
      "\"I thought you grafted the flower back to the tree of memories?\"",
      "\"I did.\"",
      "\"And isn't it supposed to stay there as one of the flowers in eternal bloom?\"",
      "Persephone crouched down and started poking the potted plant's small pomegranates.",
      "\"We don't know what it's supposed to,\" she said.",
      "\"We just know that the flowers in that tree tend to stay there in eternal bloom--until this one didn't.",
      "The flower Patroclus grew bore a fruit which fell from the tree and before I realized it, it became like this.",
      "This needs to be replanted to give it a wider berth.\"",
      "\"It's still growing?\"",
      "\"I think it is.",
      "Unlike the others in the tree which were grown from the memories of the dead in Asphodel, this one is growing from 'living' memories, I mean, memories that are still being made and shared between the two of them.\"",
      "\"But Patroclus just grew that flower.\"",
      "\"Well, since they're half of each other now...\"",
      "\"Oh, so Achilles' memories are growing that too.\"",
      "\"Yep!\"",
      "she chirped.",
      "\"Lovely isn't it?",
      "I'm thinking of giving this to them so they can replant it in their Elysium",
      "and--oh I know!\"",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"Since you're too worried about what they would do...\" \"That's because anything that happens to either of them, the Underworld also has to get involved.\"",
      "\"Exactly.",
      "So I'll plant this in my own garden.\"",
      "\"And how would that...?\" \"Like I've said, this pomegranate is growing from their memories, the memories they made before, the memories they are still making, and the memories they are about to make.",
      "In other words, the health of this pomegranate will tell us whatever is happening between the two of them that you should or should not worry about.\"",
      "\"Hold on Perse, that sounds, uh, quite rather the Elysian privacy-breaching surveillance.",
      "I'm not sure if it's lawful for us to--\" \"No,\" she said, determined.",
      "\"I think we have a duty to keep the rest of the Underworld safer from their potential future antics.",
      "I call this an early warning threat detection tree.\"",
      "\"Alright,\" Hades responded, smiling a little and not doubting a single word his wife said.",
      "\"It is what you said it is.\"",
      "I open my eyes, wide-awake now, I feel like I've had just some incredible dream and listened in to an equally incredible conversation.",
      "I cannot remember any of it except that they feel important and that they are currently slipping through my very muddled brain which is having a hard time to even tell up from down.",
      "So, first things first, I have to make a proper inventory of events, and probably establish our location, find where is north, extrapolate from it.",
      "Glean the position of the sun on the sky, the length of the shadows, whatever.",
      "Except that I wasn't able to do anything much beyond open my eyes and feel drunk.",
      "Intoxicated.",
      "Haze weighs on my head far more heavily than any alcohol has ever done.",
      "Ah yes, this, and this, and that.",
      "I can remember yesterday's sunset.",
      "And the sea.",
      "Definitely there was a sea.",
      "That much I am sure of.",
      "Beyond that, I cannot tell, for the love of all things holy, where did both the sea and the rest of the night go.",
      "It was already morning.",
      "And we were lying, or rather leaning to this massive and magnificent cedar tree that I never even knew we had in the middle of the pasture land of our Elysium.",
      "All our sheep, goats, and cows have already gone on the business of taking care of themselves because we have obviously very well failed them.",
      "They have been grazing and roaming and we have been sleeping, the Cloak of Alizarine acting as our blanket because our clothes cannot be bothered at the moment.",
      "I saw a flash on the midday sky--no, I did not actually see it.",
      "Rather, I sensed it was there.",
      "No, it wasn't actually there yet.",
      "Rather, I sensed it would be there in a short while.",
      "Like something ominous has been stalking us in the horizon.",
      "I very quickly slung my chiton around me.",
      "I dressed Achilles, careful not to wake him, tucked him under the cloak, and kissed him by the forehead.",
      "Then I ran towards our pavilion, to the shed that houses our kitchen supplies, gardening tools, as well as Achilles' bows and spears.",
      "I grabbed one of his spears.",
      "I cannot tell exactly what I am feeling threatened by or where exactly is that feeling coming from and why.",
      "I can only sense it",
      "and I just know.",
      "Like how some animals twitch their keen noses at the slightest whiff of danger.",
      "Or in my case, like how I stood in the middle of the field, eyes scouring the skies, Achilles' spear ready in my hand.",
      "Then it came.",
      "A glint of something.",
      "Like the tip of a blade.",
      "It darted unhesitatingly right where I stood.",
      "It did not merely drop from the sky but was very pointedly shot down.",
      "It was not thrown broadly.",
      "It has a target and it reached it--me.",
      "I might have screamed in alarm should I have the space for that but in that moment, all I could see was the tip of the blade, how it was perfectly aimed at me and my hand twirled the spear, its bladed end connected to it, dulled its speed, and sent the sword pirouetting back up in midair.",
      "It was a xiphos, a double-edged, one-hand shortsword.",
      "A malignant sneer almost crept up on my face when I realized that someone found it in themselves to threaten us with a 'secondary' weapon, something short enough that it demands a skilled close quarter combat and one-handed enough that its owner seems confident it can brace against anything using only the strength of their one arm.",
      "Which, as I would soon find out, is exactly the case.",
      "Someone caught the xiphos I tossed spinning in the air by the hilt and expertly rammed it downwards against me.",
      "I held the spear with both hands above my head so the blade of the xiphos fell at its center, and not--as it originally intended--on my head.",
      "I also managed to see what it was exactly that I was dealing with.",
      "What it was, was a pale-skinned young woman with a deathly cold glare on her eyes, wearing mourner's robes and sandals, and who also feels strangely familiar to me that I begin to believe I should know her.",
      "However, remembering was not at all made easier if you are fending for yourself while in the middle of it.",
      "She was, to say the least, extremely skilled in fighting as if she does this very professionally for a job.",
      "I, on the other hand, have not done anything that vaguely resembles anything warrior-like, either as a hobby or a job in life or in death.",
      "At times like this, when faced with insurmountable forces, mortals tend to pray to the gods above for help.",
      "However, being a ghost in the Underworld, that severely limited my choices.",
      "Then again, it's not like it would have made any difference if one is still alive, at least it did not work that way for me.",
      "After all the only reason I did not lose my life that early in the war was not because some god were protecting me but because Achilles was there, always keeping an eye out for me, preemptively shooting men to their deaths before they even came close.",
      "He's the one that works for me, I thought.",
      "More than any god, I'd rather speak of his name and call it a prayer.",
      "I remember that time he let me watch him secretly practicing with the spear, how he mentioned he does not let anyone else watch him fight, and how at first I did not understand why, until I saw how he fights then I knew.",
      "He fights like a warrior blessed by the gods that no ordinary mortal could ever come close to, no matter how much they work hard they would have to live with it.",
      "As one of those ordinary mortals, I lived with it.",
      "The gods have always been fickle and unfair, favoring some while cursing others, but if it's him they favored, I don't mind.",
      "I think back on all the times I watched him fight, how his lithe figure would wield the spear, how his swift-footedness would have doomed anyone before they even realized it, and how I have his own spear in my hand right now.",
      "A lightweight and perfectly well-balanced double-ended spear: a thrusting pike on one end and a slicing double-edged blade on the other.",
      "My body has been moving on its own, not having any spare second to pause and reflect on what it is doing or what to do next.",
      "I was merely replaying how Achilles fights in my memories and was hit by a damning realization that I really don't know how to fight any other way except his way.",
      "There is no one I have watched more than him and therefore I can only fight like him.",
      "Fighting half-blind has further sunk in me just how impressive Achilles has been, going toe to toe against Heracles himself, while being completely blind.",
      "Then again, a fight like that requires you to react faster than you can see and he has always been terrifyingly adept with that.",
      "I, on the other hand, for the lack of choice, have been trying.",
      "Despite being blindsided on my left, I could quite sense where the next one is coming.",
      "And I don't think being able to see fully would have helped anyway because by then it would be too late.",
      "She is terrifyingly quick, as if her feet do not even touch the ground.",
      "She is extremely clever too.",
      "She keeps jabbing the xiphos right on my chest, where it is the hardest to defend with a long weapon.",
      "I evaded all of her attempts by always sidestepping to the side and keeping myself at spear-length.",
      "She still manages to sneak in through all that so I can only spar against her with the middle section of the spear that I have been holding with both my hands, which also tends to be trickier than holding a sword with a hilt.",
      "At least you know where to put your hand if you have a weapon with a hilt.",
      "Wielding a spear means adjusting your hands along its entire length as situation demands.",
      "She is also brutally efficient with her movements, not letting up at all, the tail of her robes fluttering sharply behind him.",
      "She is raining her offense that all I could hear is the blunt thud of her blade against the shaft of my spear and the sharp thrill when it hit the bladed end.",
      "I rallied as her blade falls, defending more than attacking.",
      "Then her blade pressed firmly on the shaft of my spear, forcing a battle of power, her sword inching closer on my face.",
      "I held my ground and pushed, pushed, and pushed back, until she peeled her sword away as I drove her backwards.",
      "I huffed, \"Would you mind--?\"",
      "But I was wrong.",
      "She did not step back because she withdrew.",
      "She did so she could lunge herself anew towards me, using the distance to gain momentum.",
      "I clicked my tongue.",
      "Seriously.",
      "I braced myself.",
      "Just when I thought I knew how her blade is going to fall, it changed course.",
      "Of course it was all but a ruse on her end.",
      "I should have known.",
      "Instead of attacking from above or center, she dropped on her leg and swiped the sword from under me.",
      "I saw this before.",
      "But back then it was done to Achilles and I'm no Achilles.",
      "I sighed and in those terrifying few seconds I have, I remembered hard what he did.",
      "I straightened my back.",
      "I'm not going to let anything ruin what we gained this far.",
      "In that split second before she dropped on her leg to swing the sword by my legs, I ran up towards her and thrust the pointed end of the spear to the ground and like a vertical pole I used it to vault myself above her head.",
      "She looked like she expected me to do exactly that, which is probably rule no. 1 on the things not to do during battles: getting predicted by the opponent.",
      "She spun on her heel just as quickly, her blade already waiting on where I was about to land.",
      "Shifting position mid-air is pretty much an impossible maneuver given the lack of anything to anchor yourself with, unless you have wings, which I don't.",
      "Or, unless of course you time it well enough, and nimble reflexes are something you don't think of very much like water to a fish, then you can land to the shaft of the exact blade that has been trying to impale you on the exact moment it appeared there--and use that as a springboard for your previously impossible mid-air maneuver and somersault the hell out to safety, which was exactly what I did.",
      "Oh Achilles, I thought.",
      "How you made it all look too easy.",
      "Thankfully, I was able to land on my feet few paces away from her.",
      "Thankfully, she also finally ceased her torrential assault.",
      "She looked at me seeming contented.",
      "I tried again, \"Sorry, but would you mind--?\"",
      "Then the ground shook.",
      "It was as unmistakable as anything, I felt bloodlust shot up right from behind me.",
      "He is here.",
      "Achilles lunged from above wielding another one of his spears pointed towards our dark-robed visitor.",
      "The pointed end connected and she caught it right at the middle of her blade, defending against all the power that spear was thrust with only one hand.",
      "Achilles spun and sparred, this time becoming the one on unrelenting offense.",
      "Each strike he made connected and it shook the ground.",
      "This time she was not even bothering to return any of his attack.",
      "Like me from earlier, she was just defending.",
      "This increasingly irritated Achilles and decided to throw one fatal thrust at her and I have a bad feeling about it.",
      "\"Achilles--wait--\" I called.",
      "\"CALM DOWN!\"",
      "someone screamed, unflinchingly wedging himself between the blades of a spear and a sword with nothing but his body and sheer unadulterated grit.",
      "And this time it is someone I don't have a problem recognizing.",
      "That was a writing workout.",
      "Actiony stuffs.",
      "A fight scene right after an erotic scene.",
      "I honestly don't have lots of verb exercise as someone who mainly ever lives off sedentary nonfictional explainy stuff lol \"No, you calm down,\" followed another voice, for there were two of them.",
      "It was smooth like honey and subdued like poisoned.",
      "\"And what, in my name, do you think you're doing?\"",
      "\"Whoa.",
      "You actually called it on your name.",
      "You're pretty mad aren't you?\"",
      "the plucky boy gasped in mock surprise, his arms outstretched in utter mad hope that it would stop the two blades from clashing.",
      "Of course it wouldn't and it didn't and he should have been impaled very thoroughly a second ago had it not been for this other boy standing behind him who pulled him by the shoulder and with his other hand stopped Achilles' spear, neatly stopping the iron-tipped pike between his two fingers.",
      "As if stopping blades throttling down in full power and speed in the nick of time with only his fingers is something he does very professionally for a job.",
      "Achilles hissed but withdrew.",
      "The dark-robed woman sheathed her xiphos and stepped back too.",
      "Her eyes darted between Achilles and me, squinting really hard at us, as if her perfectly sharp pair of eyes suddenly began failing her.",
      "She looked very confused but she seemed very willing to shrug it off if it meant she could get out here faster.",
      "She seemed like she would really mind tarrying any longer than this.",
      "In fact, she already looked like she would rather do something else than talk to us.",
      "She announced, \"The Aristos Achaion passed.",
      "I see to it that he is qualified to the become your mentor.\"",
      "Huh?!",
      "Now there are a lot of things to be surprised about what she said.",
      "Like, for instance, who passed what, what did he pass, and who is going to be a mentor of whom.",
      "But what is more surprising than any of that is the fact that she doesn't seem to know who is the Aristos Achaion she meant to be talking about because she has been decidedly looking at me while undecidedly glancing at Achilles.",
      "Then with a spark of finality and idle compromise, her eyes settled on me.",
      "The boy asked, \"You mean Achilles?\"",
      "\"Yes, him,\" she pointed at me.",
      "\"At least that's the one I tested.",
      "And gods have mercy on you if you make me test this other one.",
      "I have work.\"",
      "\"That's Patroclus.",
      "This other one is Achilles.\"",
      "She grunted, still squinting at the two of us, \"Nope.",
      "Looks the same to me.\"",
      "\"I guess primordial gods cannot really tell,\" he then turned to the other boy who previously saved him, \"Actually, how could you?\"",
      "\"I can't either, but Hades said there's a trick to being able to tell them apart.",
      "If it feels like it's likely to attack you, that's Achilles.",
      "But if it feels like a perfectly calm river that you shouldn't be crossing, that's Patroclus.\"",
      "\"Is it?\"",
      "the dark-robed woman said musingly, looking at us.",
      "\"Hmm.",
      "That seems like it.\"",
      "\"I really can't tell how souls must look at you two,\" said the boy.",
      "\"We don't look at them,\" said the other boy.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "It's more like we sense them,\" replied the woman.",
      "\"Sorry, can I get word in?\"",
      "I let my impatience got to me.",
      "\"First off, I have no idea who might you all be.",
      "And secondly, what is this talk about not being able to tell us apart.\"",
      "\"Oh that.",
      "Well, primordial gods like these two can only see--or sense souls since that's what they deal with mostly.",
      "Anything living in their mortal flesh is not their business yet,\" the boy explained, as if primordial gods only seeing souls is the dreariest thing he ever said.",
      "\"With the two of you having the same soul, as in soul-bound and all, you now look exactly the same to them.",
      "And that's true the older the god is.",
      "Younger gods and those born with mortals in their lineage can pretty much tell you apart.",
      "Those who made it their job to rule over souls and judge them might have to pause and squint a bit to be able to tell.\"",
      "He paused and seemed to have remembered, \"Oh, and to answer your first question, the one here who tested you is Megaera.\"",
      "Oh.",
      "I feel like the inside of my stomach lurched.",
      "I know that name.",
      "She regarded us fiercely and coldly.",
      "The boy laughed the sudden heavy atmosphere that fell on us, \"One of the Erinyes, goddess of--hold on, what do you punish again?\"",
      "\"Infidelity?",
      "Cheaters, liars, breakers of marriage vows--and look, I know what you're thinking: with the countless broken marriage vows with married men and women sleeping with whoever, am I even doing my job?",
      "And the answer to that is--yes because that actually is not my job.",
      "They only use my name to scare their spouses from cheating.",
      "Because believe me, if that actually is my real job...\" an almost devilish grin flitted on her lips.",
      "\"Zeus won't even have a second chance to try again.",
      "And with that, I'm going to leave.",
      "My real job is waiting for me.\"",
      "She left as quickly as she arrived, a blur of shadow that flashed on the sky.",
      "\"She's a childhood friend, the warrior of us all.",
      "Fighting her is courting disaster,\" the boy shrugged, in that way you do when you tell someone they have just courted disaster.",
      "\"Then this one here is Thanatos, the God of Death, a job he actively hates, and also my best friend, a strenuous relationship I have been trying so hard to change into something that will make me his boyfriend--\" \"Seriously?\" said the god.",
      "\"With no success thus far,\" the boy cheerily continued, blatantly ignoring him.",
      "\"As I remain to be dumped for as long as I can remember.",
      "As a result, I'm looking to spend the rest of eternity in a bittersweet unrequited love to my best friend which in turn, will make me the Underworld's most eligible bachelor, unless of course I can make him change his mind.\"",
      "Then he added, in afterthought, \"Oh, and I'm Zagreus by the way, son of Hades and Persephone, which probably makes me the prince.",
      "Nice to meet you.\"",
      "Just when I thought I could recognize them as those two boys back in Theseus' Elysian Athens during the Pentathlon, the ones who helped me retrieve Hades' cloak after it was accidentally 'misappropriated' over gambling reasons, the one with an odd pair of eyes, one green and red, and the one with him dressed in pure black, they turned out to be significantly more than I can simply recognize.",
      "One is a pureblood offspring of the gods while the other is a primordial god as old as time.",
      "\"Do you think we could have used some warning in advance?",
      "Being attacked out of nowhere is a bit...\"",
      "\"I heard you were supposed to be informed about it.\"",
      "As if on cue, we noticed the rising columns of smoke coming out from the pavilion, indicating that someone else has just invited themselves over without permission, and indicating that it might be someone we know full well.",
      "*** \"Oh hi there, finally you show up.",
      "We're here to celebrate first thing in the morning.",
      "I can't believe we can't get ahold of you.",
      "Also, I can't believe I'm the one serving your guests.",
      "By the way, we used your kitchen,\" he said not even looking at us, both of his hands occupied with bowls filled with spiced uncooked meat.",
      "\"Oh yeah, one of the sisters, the goddess versatile on all weapons she could effectively slice through anything even with the dullest knife, known under the fake title of the 'Jealous One' and also the prince's stand-in mentor is coming for Achilles to test--oh.\"",
      "He then turned around and finally saw us, with both the prince mentioned and the best friend he's in love with in tow.",
      "That was of course Theseus who uses the place like it is an extension of his palace in Elysian Athens.",
      "\"So she already came?\" he said as his eyes briefly fell on us, his attention divided over a million other things in the kitchen.",
      "\"Is this fine?",
      "Tastes bland to me,\" for some reason, even Heracles was there fiddling with a bowl of batter.",
      "\"Might be lacking something.",
      "Heracles, if you mess up something as simple as these pancakes, I'll be too embarrassed to accept your bride's dowry.",
      "Don't think you're hotshot just because--hmpf!\"",
      "Heracles just poked a finger with the batter in Theseus' mouth.",
      "\"Then tell me what's lacking.\"",
      "\"Honey.\"",
      "\"Yes?\"",
      "\"Honey, I said.\"",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"Or what, you don't want this sweet?\"",
      "\"Oh I do.",
      "I very much do.\"",
      "\"Then get on with it.\"",
      "\"I have been all this time.\"",
      "A voice from the outside, \"Your Highness, the hot coals are about to go out.",
      "Are you not even using this to grill anything?\"",
      "Theseus cursed under his breath, \"My gods, I forgot.",
      "Wait!",
      "Skewer this first and grill them!\"",
      "And just like that, he shuffled out of our sight from the kitchen and Achilles followed him.",
      "The prince and his best friend trailed after him as well which leaves me alone with Heracles who was now pouring copious amounts of our honey to his batter.",
      "\"Sorry, what's happening?\"",
      "\"He wants to throw a banquet,\" he said.",
      "\"But figured the two of you might not want to go to his Athens, so he brought all of these here.\"",
      "\"Uh, and since when have you been here?\"",
      "\"This morning.",
      "You're not coming down from the mountain and you're not in the pavilion either.",
      "He waited for like, a blink or two, before deciding to start grilling.\"",
      "\"And those outside?\" \"Umm?",
      "The seven?",
      "They have been drinking since they arrived.\"",
      "\"Drinking?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"Like tea?\"",
      "\"No, like wine.\"",
      "I dashed outside.",
      "\"I. Am.",
      "Not.",
      "Drinking,\" Achilles spelled it out for me when he saw me slightly frantic, raising a plate of fig pie to me, occupying a space on one of the long tables.",
      "I scanned our pavilion, and for some reason, it felt...uh, full and busy.",
      "\"Oh nice,\" Zagreus said, immediately pulling himself up by the hearth.",
      "Thanatos sat down beside him.",
      "\"The hearth is blessed.",
      "Hestia likes this place very much.\"",
      "The god of death looked around the hustle and bustle around the pavilion, to the dead who have not even noticed him yet, to the dead who have been drinking both wine and tea this morning, eating pickled olives and fig pies.",
      "Something deliriously similar to a smile almost flickered on his face.",
      "\"No.",
      "It's because this place is like this that Hestia blessed their hearth.",
      "Not the other way round.\"",
      "\"Come on.",
      "If you cannot love me at least don't antagonize me.\"",
      "The god of death groaned, \"Must you always remind me?\"",
      "\"How else would l I know if you already changed your mind.\"",
      "Outside the pavilion, hot coals glowed on the ceramic trays where the skewered meat will be grilled.",
      "Theseus and his retinue brought these portable grill as well as the griddles from where I believe Heracles would cook his pancakes.",
      "There were several of these smoking grills and griddles arranged in a semicircle and being tended to by the seven, who were also getting drunk while on it, except for Amphiaraus who was sipping tea.",
      "It felt strange, for some reason, to have Heracles back in our kitchen making pancakes, Theseus and his band of seven grilling skewered meat in front of our pavilion, and the Prince of the Underworld and the God of Death huddled up in the corner by our hearth.",
      "If a prophet ever told me when I was alive that in the afterlife, this is what I would be having, I would not believe it.",
      "All of this felt kind of wrong to me somehow.",
      "But then, I see Achilles munching down on a fig pie I made for him, crumbs on his cheeks and suddenly everything feels right.",
      "I smiled and thought to myself, yes, this is how it is supposed to be.",
      "\"WHAT?!\"",
      "Theseus exclaimed.",
      "Gods, what is it this time.",
      "\"What do you mean the Eumenides came and fought Patroclus?",
      "Also, why didn't I see it?",
      "I wanted to watch it.",
      "Why didn't you call me?\"",
      "Oi.",
      "What do you mean you want to watch?",
      "Is this all an entertainment to you?",
      "I met Theseus' eyes and just when I wanted to make a run for it, he caught me by the arm and fussed about it, \"You!",
      "You...did you?\"",
      "\"He did,\" Tydeus, one of the seven, said.",
      "\"We saw the whole thing from up here.",
      "It was entertaining.\"",
      "\"What?!\"",
      "now it's my turn to scream.",
      "\"You watched the whole thing--and you just watched the whole thing?\"",
      "\"That's one of the Eumenides you know.",
      "You don't make a point of crossing her.\"",
      "\"Having a fight like that to watch made the wine better.\"",
      "\"We called you, you know,\" said the other to Theseus.",
      "\"Didn't you even notice the earthquakes just now?\"",
      "\"Achilles fought too,\" said the other.",
      "\"Hence, the earthquakes.",
      "Seriously what were you even doing with Heracles you didn't notice?\"",
      "\"And then?\"",
      "Theseus asked.",
      "\"And then what?\"",
      "\"I'm asking how did the judgment go?\"",
      "\"She just said the Aristos Achaion passed.",
      "Although she seemed confused as to whether she meant Achilles or me.\"",
      "\"Ah, oh, yes, of course,\" he replied, unsurprised.",
      "\"But what are you doing taking on one of the sisters?",
      "First, you swam Lethe.",
      "Now you crossed with one of the venerable goddesses?",
      "Just where all this daring coming from?\"",
      "\"Because no one told us that she is scheduled to drop in today and Achilles should have been ready for that.\"",
      "\"How am I supposed to tell you that if I cannot even find you?",
      "Rhadamanthus said he just gave you the Stone yesterday, so where were you actually--hold on, where are the Stones?\"",
      "It's the season for banquet.",
      "(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)",
      "Theseus, gods bless him, would not stop laughing.",
      "And I feel like I've seen him like this before.",
      "\"Where are the stones?\" he asked.",
      "I looked at Achilles.",
      "It was not around his neck.",
      "I fumbled around my chest and mine was not there either.",
      "My very muddled mind tried its best to sort out its memories of last night.",
      "The last time I saw them was when--oh.",
      "\"Hey, what's with that look?",
      "Don't tell me you lost them?",
      "Then start looking for them already.",
      "Achilles is one thing.",
      "But how did you lose yours too Patroclus--\" Theseus' eyes alighted on Achilles who was putting another bite in his mouth.",
      "I followed what he was looking at, curious as to why he stopped mid-sentence.",
      "He was looking at his wrists, or rather, the string marks that were left on them.",
      "I threw a palm on my forehead.",
      "\"Oh forget it,\" Theseus grinned at me.",
      "\"I know exactly how you lost yours.\"",
      "Then he paused and frowned, as if something piqued his curiosity once more, before muttering softly, \"Patroclus, you.",
      "Are you saying you went one-on-one against the Eumenides this morning right after you went one-on-one against Achilles last night?",
      "Where does all this stamina coming from?\"",
      "\"My liege, I would be very glad if you would allow me to hit you just once.\"",
      "We are now in Rhadamanthus' palace, with the ruler of Elysium sitting on his throne and with Theseus crouched on his knees, laughing.",
      "Rhadamanthus sighed long and hard, in a way that reminded me of Hades.",
      "\"What do you even do with necklaces?\"",
      "Behind us, I heard Theseus choked from giggling.",
      "The judge ignored him, \"I can't believe you lost yours Patroclus in less than a day.",
      "You're only meant to wear them.",
      "How could you lose something that's just hanging around your neck?",
      "And both of you at the same time?\"",
      "Achilles replied wearily, \"Like I've said, we took them off and they got lost in the sea.\"",
      "Rhadamanthus thumbed his temples, \"And now you're telling me that you have also lost the sea?",
      "So you can't find the Stones?\"",
      "\"We didn't lose the sea.",
      "How does anyone go around misplacing the sea?\"",
      "\"Achilles, you have misplaced an entire river.\"",
      "Achilles decidedly ignored him, \"This sea just pops in and out in our Elysium, you see, and it's not there now.",
      "We don't know when it will appear again.\"",
      "\"Then why did you have to toss the Stones out to the sea?\"",
      "I followed the brows that furrowed intensely on Rhadamanthus' forehead.",
      "I could tell he was really grappling to put two and two together.",
      "\"We didn't toss--why do you make it sound like we intentionally--no, I actually...",
      "I might have just actually tossed...\"",
      "Achilles turned at me and in that honest way he does, asked, \"I did actually...",
      "didn't",
      "I?\"",
      "Theseus wasn't even keeping up appearances anymore and was now laughing wildly.",
      "I tried not to get distracted and struggled to keep myself composed.",
      "\"My lord,\" I said, humbled and apologetic.",
      "I knew full well how important it is for the Elysium to remain as a picture of perfect paradise with its residents free from suffering.",
      "\"Let me--\" \"Us.",
      "Let us,\" Achilles snapped and gave me a look.",
      "I smiled.",
      "\"Let us take responsibility for it.",
      "If we have to go somewhere to replace them, please let us.\"",
      "Rhadamanthus regarded me carefully before finally walking to the small fountain at the corner of the throne room.",
      "He picked something from underneath the pool and he closed his fist around them.",
      "He approached us and wordlessly offered his closed hand.",
      "I reached an open palm underneath them and he handed me a new pair of stones.",
      "Except that this time they did not come as a pair of necklaces.",
      "It's a pair of gleaming moon white rings that is shaped like a wishbone at the center.",
      "\"It's the Rings of Hecate.",
      "Since they come as rings this time, please do not go out of your way to take them off.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" I replied politely.",
      "\"They work like the stones you lost except that these ones do not rely on cheap tricks like projecting what others expect to see.",
      "It's a genuine spell of illusion.\"",
      "\"If you have something like this, why not give this right from the start?\"",
      "Achilles asked.",
      "\"Because no. 1, these rings only work as a pair.",
      "On their own, it's just a piece of rock.",
      "Patroclus initially did not need it.",
      "And no. 2, these rings are not originally created as an artifact to cast the spell of illusion such as hiding the scars of Tartarus.",
      "That's just something I asked the goddess to include.\"",
      "\"What does it originally do?\"",
      "\"It's supposed to be an amulet to bind your lover to you so they will not forget you especially if they are going away.",
      "According to the stories, Hecate once plucked the wishbone of an immortal bird, two pieces of bones that even if broken apart will inevitably fuse back together.",
      "Since she doesn't have a lot of immortal birds to pluck it from, eventually she made a spell that does the same thing and put them on these wishbone-shaped rings.",
      "It's apparently most effective if worn under oath on the night of a full moon.",
      "Hecate is said to preside over that oath on such a night.\"",
      "There was a brief silence.",
      "At least until Achilles",
      "and I broke it.",
      "I said, \"We don't need this--\" He said, \"We don't need this --\" We both looked at each other equally pleasantly surprised to know we were thinking the same thing.",
      "Then Achilles began to chuckle.",
      "I smiled.",
      "\"Oh my gods,\" I heard Theseus groan.",
      "\"Of course I know you don't need it,\" if Rhadamanthus could allow himself to condescend us by rolling his eyes, he would have.",
      "\"It won't work on you either because you're already bound by something else stronger than that.",
      "I just find them useful when it comes to you two since those rings are also bound to each other.",
      "If you lose one of them, you can use the other to find it.\"",
      "\"How?\"",
      "\"I don't know.",
      "But I don't encourage you to find out.\"",
      "\"What if we lost both of them?\"",
      "\"They have the power to find their way back to whoever they belong.",
      "Those rings will only fit you and only you and cannot be worn by anyone else.",
      "But please, don't try to test that.\"",
      "\"We won't,\" I declared.",
      "Rhadamanthus looked incredulous.",
      "\"On the event we fail, please know that at least we tried,\" I said again.",
      "\"Or at least, I tried.\"",
      "***",
      "When we came back, the crowd in the pavilion had grown.",
      "Both the boatman Charon and the craftsman Daedalus found their way here, chatting amiably with Amphiaraus.",
      "The rest of the seven were rowdy and already drunk.",
      "Aesclepius, the greatest doctor who ever lived and died, of more renown than his father, killed by the gods for being powerful enough to raise the dead back to life, seemed--in something that felt revelatory to me--to be engrossed in a pleasant conversation with the God of Death, Thanatos.",
      "Zagreus, the Prince of the Underworld and Peneia, the unknown hidden child of Apollo were, for some reason, sulky and grumpy about something.",
      "I heard someone say, \"Are you seriously grilling meat on Hestia's hearth?\"",
      "To which the prince replied, \"It's fine isn't it?",
      "Hestia's fire never goes out.",
      "Also, she doesn't mind.\"",
      "\"Hold on, what are we celebrating again?\"",
      "I asked Theseus.",
      "\"Oh that,\" he gave Achilles a wreath of olives.",
      "\"Do him the honor, will you?\"",
      "Achilles unhesitatingly wreathed me the kotinos.",
      "I said, \"What is this for?\"",
      "\"As the victor of the fifth game of my Pentathlon.\"",
      "\"What? How come?\"",
      "\"You got Heracles on the last one so it was your victory.\"",
      "\"What--no--that wasn't!\"",
      "\"It's fine, it's fine.",
      "He conceded to you already.",
      "We're holding the awarding and the banquet now.\"",
      "\"You just want a reason to drink.\"",
      "\"And you should too.",
      "You should always find a reason to celebrate, Patroclus.",
      "The smallest, most insignificant ones are just as worthy of celebration as the biggest, most earth-shattering of reasons.",
      "Happiness are abound in this world just as much as suffering is.",
      "Don't let any of them just pass you by unnoticed,\" Theseus raised me a toast and cheered.",
      "\"And don't let suffering be all there is.\"",
      "I stared at him speechless.",
      "All this time and it is only at this moment that I am made to remember that this man had lived long enough before us, and is definitely older than us, and now also probably--gods help us all--potentially wiser than us.",
      "The evening progressed and everything felt like a whirlwind.",
      "Theseus joined those who were drinking and guzzling mead out of the amphora.",
      "Achilles and I found ourselves frying Heracles' pancakes and eating them.",
      "They were too sweet.",
      "\"My throat wants to scorch itself from the sweetness of this thing,\" Achilles took a few swigs of the sideritis brew in between his bites.",
      "He sniped a look at Heracles and screamed at the other table, \"Heracles!",
      "Why is the only thing that's sweet about you is your pancakes?\"",
      "I choked in between bites and started laughing uncontrollably.",
      "Zagreus, slightly tipsy now, shouted back in reply from across the pavilion, \"At least something about him is sweet!",
      "All I have is knives.\"",
      "\"Sucks to be you Prince,\" Achilles yelled in response.",
      "\"You won't say that if you aren't lucky enough to land Patroclus!",
      "Goddamn it.",
      "Born invincible then you fell for someone who also loved you back.",
      "That shouldn't be fair, is it?\"",
      "\"I worked on that brat!\"",
      "\"Is it that sweet?\"",
      "I heard Theseus say.",
      "Heracles pushed him a plate and he took a bite.",
      "\"That's about right, isn't it?\"",
      "Achilles groaned.",
      "Zagreus went back to grilling by the hearth and muttered sulkily, \"Yes, yes, I've got it already.",
      "No need to rub it in.\"",
      "Thanatos looked like he would rather be picking souls at the moment.",
      "Aesclepius came to pick one of those pancakes and gave a plate to Peneia who received them reluctantly but proceeded to eat them ravenously.",
      "\"Hecate's wishbone rings,\" he whistled when he saw the rings decorating the fingers next to our pinky.",
      "\"Mortals flock to the goddess praying for these exact rings.",
      "Depending on whoever wears them, they can either be a scourge or a gift.\"",
      "\"Why would it be a scourge?\"",
      "Achilles asked.",
      "\"Wishbone rings are oath rings.",
      "And an oath you don't intend to keep is nothing but a scourge.",
      "Which makes these rings completely redundant to you since you two are already soul-bound.",
      "Why do you have these?\"",
      "\"As replacement for the Stones of Rhadamanthus.\"",
      "\"What happened to the Stones?\"",
      "\"Please don't ask.\"",
      "Aesclepius stared at us and seemingly knowing what's good for him, did not pursue that question.",
      "His eyes fell on my heel.",
      "\"Oh that reminds me,\" he stooped down and grabbed my ankle to inspect it.",
      "\"Excuse me?\" said Achilles as if it was his ankle that was seized.",
      "\"Mmmm it grafted fully,\" the doctor mused.",
      "\"This is nice.",
      "At this rate, you won't probably need to replace it.",
      "Double-beings sure are full of surprises.",
      "And Achilles, please don't look at me like you intend to stab me and make it look like an accident.",
      "My staff is not meant to be used that way.\"",
      "Achilles drove the staff with the lone snake entwined around it to the soft earth where it buried itself.",
      "\"I don't intend to make it look like an accident.\"",
      "\"Let me have a look at you too.\"",
      "\"I don't--\"",
      "The doctor seized him by the ankle too despite his protest.",
      "I watched him examine Achilles' heel and a thought occurred to me.",
      "\"If you're around, would you mind teaching me?\"",
      "\"It's fine.",
      "His heel is fine.",
      "You won't have to worry about that.",
      "As for the gift of speed he lost, well, what is lost in River Styx can only be returned by the River Styx.",
      "Then again, being double-beings on par with the gods, why would you need it for--\" \"No, I mean, would you mind teaching me the healing arts?\"",
      "It came both as a surprise to both the doctor and Achilles.",
      "I looked at Achilles' heel, the tendon he destroyed and I remembered how back then he couldn't even walk.",
      "I remembered the scars on his back, the wounds that caused them and the poisons that debilitated him.",
      "I remembered how helpless all of that made me feel.",
      "I remembered about those who took advantage of him when he was at his most vulnerable.",
      "I remembered and remembered, and I thought: I want to be able to do this.",
      "\"Look, would you listen.",
      "Like I've been saying, why would you want to--\" \"Please,\" I said.",
      "Aesclepius sighed, \"Fine.",
      "I don't mind.",
      "It's not that hard.\"",
      "Then he turned at Achilles, \"See?",
      "That's how you get jealous.",
      "You get whoever makes you feel they are more qualified than you to teach you what makes them more qualified than you.\"",
      "\"No, I don't think you're more qualified than me when it comes to him at least.\"",
      "He ignored me, \"Man, I'm such a good catch it's almost a pity I already resigned myself to taking care of my brother from a different mother.",
      "Right, young Peneus?\"",
      "He turned around only to find the kid serving himself grilled meat from Zagreus' batch from Hestia's hearth.",
      "\"How about knowing his name for starters?\"",
      "I asked.",
      "The doctor followed his young brother where he began snatching the food off his plate.",
      "Meanwhile, Achilles has stopped eating and just kept on poking the hot coals sizzling on the griddle.",
      "\"May I ask why you are so guarded against Aesclepius?\"",
      "\"I'm not guarded against him.",
      "If we ever get into a fight--no, we can't--it would only look like I'm picking on him.\"",
      "\"But you glare at him pretty intensely more often than you do with, say, Theseus.",
      "I'm wondering if he did something to you.\"",
      "Achilles was silent that I thought he must not want to talk about it.",
      "I'm ready to wait for him but he spoke again, \"Because he's...he's...\" he looked like he wanted to swallow the words more than spit them out.",
      "\"Because he's definitely a good man,\" he finally said, frustrated to admit it.",
      "\"Better than me in many respects that you care about.",
      "Didn't you admire Chiron because he's a healer too?",
      "So much that now you also wanted to take up the art of medicine.",
      "Back in the army, you were more known by the people you saved than the people you killed.",
      "And I'm just...just...well, I'm the opposite of that...\"",
      "He continued, \"Aesclepius is a doctor, the greatest in fact.",
      "He has only saved lives.",
      "He never took them.",
      "He's everything that I am not.",
      "I mean, uh, what I'm saying is...\"",
      "You're saying you're jealous.",
      "Goddamn it.",
      "Seriously.",
      "I threw both palms on my face.",
      "I'll give you my soul if I have to.",
      "I'd rather burn hell than give up on you.",
      "I'd die by your hands if that will save you.",
      "And you're worried about the greatest doctor waltzing in and probably catching my eyes?",
      "\"Achilles,\" I said, desperately struggling to keep a straight face.",
      "\"You can't be this sinfully endearing all the time.",
      "It's bad for my heart and for my sense of reason.\"",
      "\"Huh?\"",
      "*** It was the darkness before dawn.",
      "Or at least what is left of it.",
      "Morning is on its way.",
      "I opened my eyes and woke up to the bodies that were strewn everywhere, either passed out drunk or just sleeping.",
      "Achilles was leaning on my shoulder.",
      "I found my hand on his.",
      "What I did not find however was the ring on his finger.",
      "I remember him going out of his way and tossing it out somewhere in the middle of the night last night while saying something along the lines of, \"Let's see if your ring can really find it.\"",
      "It hasn't even been a full day since the ruler of Elysium specifically told us not to test it and he has already thrown it to find out.",
      "That's just one of the things I love about him.",
      "My ring felt warm on my finger.",
      "It is also blinking, dazzling and dimming alternately.",
      "I held my hand up and forward and it went slower.",
      "I held my hand to my right and there was it again, blinking fast as if telling me to hurry up.",
      "I roused myself, kissed Achilles on the forehead and followed the ring that is searching for its pair.",
      "It brought me to one of the hills in our Elysium, one of the vantage points from where you can survey the fields below and beyond.",
      "It is unsurprising to me that Achilles was able to throw that high and far.",
      "I sifted through the earth, following my ring's signal.",
      "Until finally there it was, right by the fig tree, glinting like the first rays of the sunrise that is already peeking from the horizon, dramatic reds and orange already pouring from it, bathing our Elysium.",
      "I picked up Achilles' ring.",
      "\"Oh, you actually found it.\"",
      "I turned around, slightly surprised, \"Since when?\"",
      "\"Since you kissed me good morning.",
      "I've been stealthily following you.\"",
      "The sunrise tinged his cheeks warm orange.",
      "He smiled and its warmth coursed through me.",
      "I let it soaked me in.",
      "\"This here is really the best view to watch the sunrise.\"",
      "\"Did you throw the ring out here on purpose?",
      "Is this your way of inviting me to watch it together?\"",
      "\"Of course not,\" he said, trying to be wily and shy at the same time and perfectly pulling it off.",
      "\"I could just drag you out here if I want to.\"",
      "I gazed at him, light spilling on his face and I heard Aesclepius' words ring in my ears.",
      "Wishbone rings are oath rings.",
      "\"Achilles,\" I said, sunrise on his face, wind on his hair.",
      "I took his hand and slid the ring up his finger.",
      "\"We need no oath.",
      "We need no vows, but let me say it anyway.\"",
      "I kissed the hand that is wearing the ring and I declared.",
      "\"Let me take care of you for the rest of our time.\"",
      "Here in our afterlife, afterwards, a new sun rises for us.",
      "I gaze at the rings on our fingers, fingers that are entwined with each other.",
      "I begin to think about how these rings hold our secrets with us.",
      "About how they hide the scars we share.",
      "About the soul we share.",
