    "text": "Unexpected Hephaestus wiped his brow and sighed with contentment, and truthfully, more than a little pride. His newest creation would please Zeus. He motioned to his automatons and they carried the golden table away. He was turning towards his workbench andsomething brightly coloured showed out of the gloom and caught the corner of his eye. He stopped and looked to the low couch under the window on the west wall. On the kline was Dionysus in his purple cloak, who regarded him with a small smile. Hephaestus did not recall the younger god having visited the forge before. Remembering the long ago incident with the donkey, he was suspicious as to the cause of the visit. \"Dionysus, to what do I owe the pleasure?\" his voice left no doubt of his true feelings. The other simply tilted his head to the side, and continued smiling, oblivious or intentionally ignoring his sneer. \"I like it here; it's quite peaceful.\" Hephaestus gestured at the surrounding room, where his assistants worked away, hammering with loud clangs. \"You find this calming? No-one else can abide the noise.\" \"Do you keep it thus so the others will stay away?\" Dionysus responded. \"You haven't answered my question.\" Hephaestus was puzzled and frustrated. What purpose did Dionysus have in being here? Dionysus wrinkled his brow briefly in thought. \"What question -oh, about it being calming here. Compared to the shouts of my devotees,\" Dionysus smiled wryly,\"It's noisy but impersonal.\" Hephaestus crossed his arms over his chest and stared down at Dionysus in disbelief. \"I find it difficult to believe that you, of all of us, would take comfort in the impersonal.\" Dionysus shrugged. \"I find your work fascinating as it is so different from my own. You helpers are silent and loyal; you have no one to please but yourself. It is more than a little enviable.\" Hephaestus did not know what to make of the other's candour. \"You may stay then, and are welcome to what you peace you can find here,\" he said. Dionysus smiled in response and lay back on the kline. Appropriately enough, he looked like an invitation to debauchery. Dark golden blond curls fell onto his forehead and long, slimly muscled legs stretched out on the couch. He watched Hephaestus with a look that seemed half interested and half flirtatious. Hephaestus was unsure how much of his demeanour was artifice and how much was the way Dionysus simply was. He managed to tear his gaze from the beguiling youth and turned back to his work. Hephaestus himself had often found solace here, but it was a solace based on necessity. He alone among the Olympians did not appear handsome or move with grace. Instead of enduring their pitying smiles he had created for himself this forge, his artificial assistants, his work. That anyone else, least of all the patron of wine and theatre could find repose here was a mystery to him. He suspected that Dionysus was up to something, but was not able to determine what. Hours later, he turned to show Dionysus the completed helmet he had crafted but the young god was gone. He felt strangely bereft. That day began a pattern of visits from the young deity. Dionysus would slip unobtrusively into the workshop so that Hephaestus would turn around and he would simply be there, stretched out on the low couch and watching the goings on with casual interest. Occasionally he would ask a question about what Hephaestus was making and when Hephaestus would tell him, Dionysus would often make a witty comment about the recipient. His comments were barbed but never cruel and Hephaestus began to laugh with him. Dionysus seemed pleased that Hephaestus shared his humour but gave no further indication of why he was there. He was beginning to think that Dionysus was planning an elaborate prank but whether he or another was the victim, he still had no idea. One morning he caught himself looking more forward to Dionysus' company than to his work. He wondered whether the younger god felt the same. It seemed that he enjoyed his visits, but Hephaestus remained cynical. Hephaestus dined that evening with the others at Zeus' table in hopes of insight. Perhaps Dionysus' behaviour would yield a clue. But the meal passed with no sign of Dionysus. Hephaestus was bored, frustrated, drank too much wine, and retired early. The next morning he awoke late and with a pounding headache. He forced himself to his work and entered the forge shouting at his automatons. They responded swiftly and silent, perfect workers just as he had created them. \"It seems as if someone didn't sleep well.\" The voice, unexpected amongst the mechanical sounds of the forge, made him stop in surprise. He turned and saw Dionysus, draped over the couch, looking smug and dangling a bunch of grapes from one hand. \"Grape?\" he asked, proffering them. \"No thank you. I am not fee- I do not need a morning meal,\" Hephaestus grumbled. Dionysus flashed him a smile. \"Grapes aren't a meal, they're merely something to enjoy.\" He rolled a grape between his thumb and forefinger and looked as if he was going to pop it into his mouth. He stopped though, and raised himself up gracefully to stand before Hephaestus. \"They're an amusement for the tongue,\" he continued, \"And very good grapes. I should know.\"Dionysus held the fruit to Hephaestus' lips. \"I'm sure you'll find none better.\" Dionysus said the last with such lascivious invitation that Hepheastus' lips opened of their own accord, accepting the offer. As he bit down, the sweet, tart juice sprang onto his tongue. He wondered what his expression must have looked like because the youth regarded him with a superior smile. \"It's delicious,\" he said, hoping Dionysus would not notice the flush that crept beneath his beard. Dionysus, to his surprise, did not mock him but only said, \"I knew you'd find it so, once you tried it.\" Then with the air of someone who has delivered the last clever word in a debate, he departed, leaving Hephaestus alone, the musky taste of fruit dissolving on his tongue. The rest of the day Hephaestus could not seem to concentrate on his work. He worked and barked orders at his assistants, but felt none of his usual satisfaction. He was frustrated at himself for allowing himself to be affected in this way. It had almost seemed as if Dionysus had been offering something more than a grape. Impossible. He alone on Olympus was not beautiful and Dionysus was youthful and strong, and his adherents worked themselves into a frenzy over him and his gift. Hephaestus retired to his chambers that night, baffled and angry. He tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Unbidden thoughts of dark blond curls and laughing grey eyes haunted him, as did echoes of the intoxicating voice, bot innocent and seductive. He imagined how Dionysus' skin would be warm beneath his fingers and how he would taste like grapes, sweet and pungent. Hephaestus flushed with excitement and shame as he lay against too warm bedclothes fisting his erection. He did not need to slake his desire by engaging in unrequited fantasies. He need only beckon and someone would come to him - a dewy-eyed maiden or a willowy youth, adherents from his temple. But neither would be the company he craved so he did not call out, merely sighed a name as he trembled and spilled over his hand. He awoke at dawn, satisfied from a deep sleep and pleasant dreams of young, strong limbs tangling with his own. It would be easy, he thought, to find a lover from amongst the Athenian youths who worshipped the patron of metal smiths. Beautiful boys, strong of leg and back, with golden curls and deep eyes, and if they lacked keen wit and sharp observation, what would it matter? He had made the decision. He would visit Athens and honour some youth with his favour.He banished Dionysus from his thoughts just as Dionysus had vanished from his forge.Hephaestus thought himself firm in his resolve. When he arrived at his workshop, he realised that he had fooled himself.Despite the early hour, Dionysus was waiting for him. At the sight of him, Hephaestus' will dissolved. \"Pleasant dreams?\" Dionysus asked. Somehow, Hephaestus felt he knew the answer. Anger began to boil up within him. Was this what the young god had been playing at? To fill him with desire and show him a fool? \"Did you not send them to me?\" Hephaestus growled in response. \"I would hope so,\" was the reply. Dionysus looked at him without guile. He approached Hephaestus slowly as if afraid of startling him. \"And why would you hope such things? A prank? A wager, perhaps with Hermes on how you could affect the old, lame Hephaestus whom all Olympians mock?\" He hated the self-pity in his voice but hoped it cut the other as well. \"Is that what you think of me? Have I not sat and watched you work, laughed with you, and craved your company?\" His voice was soothing and he stepped closer and raised a fine boned hand to Hephaestus' bearded cheek. \"Did you never stop to think my motives were somewhat more simple?\" His breath was warm against Hephaestus' chest. Hephaestus looked down at Dionysus and without pausing to think, leaned down to kiss him. It was unexpected, this thing between them, but it was welcome. The god of wine did not taste of grapes, but of warmth and affection and Hephaestus was content.",

    "text": "The wind blows in from the sea this night, cold gusts whipping past tent-flaps drawn tightly to guard against it. Inside many of the tents, men swear and bundle their blankets around themselves even tighter than before. Many of them mutter something superstitious about bad omens. However, inside one tent, there is none of that. The only reaction to the wind that can be found is when the lamp flickers, threatening to go out altogether, as it had done many times already since the sun had set. There is a muffled curse, and the boy - we'll call him a boy, for although he has proven himself many times over in battle and is in some ways much more mature than his companion, he somehow presents himself as younger than he really is with his clean-shaven face and his softly-spoken words - hastily cups his hands around the flame to keep it lit. It's an awkward position, as he had to reach sideways and behind himself slightly from where he's lying on his bedroll, but the heat feels good against his hands, and the wind has not yet died down. He shifts into a more comfortable position, somehow managing to overbalance the lamp in the process. It's the hands of the second man -- for he was a man, one whom perhaps still acts as though he would prefer not to be, with a hardness in his eyes that speaks of bloodshed and death and a carelessness that has always gotten him into trouble and will continue to until the day he dies -- are what save the lamp this second time. He rights it, looking up at the boy from his own bedroll. \"Careful. I may begin to think that you're afraid of the dark, with all you continue re-lighting that thing.\" The boy gives him a look that says that the man's comment is beneath his consideration. He's very good at such looks, having had many years of dealing with the man to perfect them. \"I thought you were asleep.\" \"No,\" the man says, and does not offer more when the boy waits expectantly. \"Ah,\" the boy says at long last, but he does not move his gaze from the man's face. \"It's getting late, but you're not in the mood for sleeping, nor for talking.\" The man snorts. \"Nor for other things, if that's what you're implying.\" The boy props himself up on an elbow and shrugs. \"That's all right. You're not exactly good company.\" \"My company has never bothered you before.\" \"That could be because the last time you acted like this, Chiron was there to punish you for it.\" There is a silence then, broken only by the whistling of the wind. Somewhere in the center of the camp, it causes something heavy to crash to the ground. \"You say that I am acting like a child,\" the man says slowly, sounding almost hurt. \"We came here to fight.\" The boy does not answer the question directly. \"And fight we did. Quite well, too.\" \"The war is not over yet, even if you would have it be.\" The man growls, rolling over so that he does not have to face the boy. That is his usual way of dealing with such things. Ignoring them until he gets his way. When it comes to that sort of thing, perhaps he is more a boy than man. \"You call it a war? More like a glorified domestic dispute. Ugh, women.\" \"Mmm,\" the boy murmurs, raising an eyebrow. \"And I'm sure you'd know nothing of being driven to extremes for the sake of a single woman.\" His voice is soft, and were it not obviously otherwise, one might think it was an innocent comment. The man's shoulders seem to stiffen, but it could just be an illusion made from the shadows cast by the still-wavering flame. If anything, though, it just causes him to retreat further to his end of the tent. The boy looks up at the ceiling of the tent as though the weave of the cloth is the most fascinating thing he's seen all day, and folds his hands behind his head. \"Men are dying,\" he says. \"That's war,\" the man agrees. \"But I thought this wasn't war?\" \"I think you're beginning to annoy me.\" \"Good.\" Pause. The boy leans over to extinguish the flame at long last, blowing it out with a simple breath, then wetting his fingers to twist the wick and make sure that it was truly out. Their silence seems somehow heavier now, as though it were weighed down by the sudden darkness. Finally, the man speaks. \"What would you have me do, then? For curiosity's sake?\" The boy closes his eyes. \"I would have you forget about the woman. Then, I would have you either fight with your men or pull your ships out and return home.\" \"Return home?\" \"Yes.\" \"Without the honor of the battlefield?\" It's not so much a question for the sake of an answer, but rather a question for the sake of having a question. \"It would be your choice.\" The boy sounds suddenly weary, as though he wishes the conversation already over and done with. \"But I know that you will not agree to any of those requests.\" \"Then why bother asking?\" \"Because I have another request.\" \"And?\" \"Let me wear your armor to battle tomorrow. I will fight in your stead. It does your men no good to see you holed up in your tent like this.\" The boy says this haltingly, as though he's unsure of the implications his question will have. The man thinks about this. The boy is a friend, and were he only that, he would not let him have his way. But the two of them are more than that. They have known one another long enough to be considered brothers, but that does not quite describe their relationship accurately, either. They are two halves of a whole, perfectly balancing one another. And so, the man knows his answer. \"You may,\" says Achilles. And Patroclus smiles. Outside, the wind continues to howl.",

    "text": "I've always wondered if I would see my own death. Or if, after all those dreadful visions that had come true, my cruel gift would forsake me at last. But Apollo was not merciful; I knew that. So here I was, having survived the destruction of my home, the death of all the people I loved, and my own defilement. I clutched the wall of the chariot, feeling like a sheep brought to the slaughterhouse. Agamemnon turned and gave me a smile. I could only think of his hands groping at me in the darkness, his stench that was unescapable in the crowded ship. My fate was to live the rest of my life as a slave in his hands. That was all I could see of my future, a black abyss at my feet, going down endlessly. He went into the palace, and I was forgotten by him and by everyone else, left by myself outside in the chariot. It didn't matter anymore. I would just stay here and wait for whatever was to come. I tried to stop thinking of the future, but then my thoughts were slipping to the past. The burning walls of Troy, the dead warriors, the screaming women, the crying children. I could still see it when I closed my eyes. Someone was approaching me. It was Clytemnestra, Queen of Argos, wife of my captor. \"Come inside, Cassandra,\" she said and held out a hand. She was not smiling, but her dark eyes had a look of warmth that I had not seen in anyone for a long time. \"You will be treated kindly.\" I just looked at her without answering, reluctant to take the step that would seal my life as a slave. It had been sealed long ago, but that was none of my doing. Even if I had no choice now, it still seemed to me that walking to her and entering the house would mean that I had accepted my fate. I wasn't ready for that yet. \"Don't be afraid. It may seem hard to come here as a slave, but you will learn that he is not a cruel master, neither am I.\" I wondered at her kind words. There was no need for that; they could just have me dragged inside. Here was the Queen, come out of the hall, where she was welcoming her long-awaited husband, to stand in the cold and coax me like a shy horse. Maybe she is not that happy to see her husband, I suddenly thought. He had their daughter killed - what mother could ever forgive this? My next thought drowned in a flood of pictures filling my head. Blood forming a pool on polished marble stones. Blood painting the edge of an axe. Blood trickling down from a pair of slender hands. Blood streaming from a figure on the floor, crumbled in a heap like a discarded doll. The axe was striking down, crashing into the flesh, once, twice, thrice. Then I saw her face, her eyes were twinkling, and she was grinning in wild joy. I blinked, and it was gone. I was shaking and tried to steady myself. It had always been like this, coming out of nowhere and lasting no more than a fraction of a moment. I don't think she had noticed it. She was still looking at me, the same eyes, such a caring look that I could not believe it was the same woman. But it was. I had never been wrong. \"Do you understand what I'm saying?\" She gestured to me and back to her. \"Or don't you speak Greek at all?\" I didn't move. I wanted nothing more than just to get away from this house. It was a curse, and I didn't want to witness the destruction playing out. How could she be friendly with me when she was planning in this same instant the murder of her husband? I turned my head and stared into the empty air. I couldn't stand to look at her anymore. I was glad when she finally walked away. Let her think I was a dumb barbarian. As long as I didn't have to go into that house. Seeing the visions come true with my own eyes was always the worst. Every time I had been hoping that maybe this time I would be wrong. Yet I had never been able to escape the dreaded truth. What would be my fate? Was I also to die on the marble floor by the axe in her hand? Was this Apollo's last punishment? I hoped so. I had seen enough. There was no future for me except bleak despair. Then another vision hit me. A shadow leaning over me, stretched out like a long dark snake. I didn't dare to look, but I had to. The axe was bloody, it lingered over my head. My look followed the blade to where it met the hilt, the hilt to where it was tightly held by the long-fingered hands, the arms and the shoulders covered with flowing silk, up to her face. Her eyes dark with obsession and hate and a hint of sorrow. Then I saw no more. So it would come, here and now. I felt calm now that I knew. All was going to be as it was meant to be. No need to fear any more, because this would be the end. I didn't want to wait any longer. There was no use in delaying what was inevitable; it would only bring fear and more misery. I stepped off the chariot and walked slowly but steadily to the palace. When I came to the door, I recoiled. A stench of blood engulfed me and made me gag. No. I couldn't go in there. I just couldn't. \"Help me, Apollo!\" I cried, but it was in vain. The god had cursed me long ago. I sank down on the ground and covered my face in my hands. I wished I could tear my eyes out so I wouldn't have to see anymore. In my mind I still saw blood and death, his and mine. I could not escape it. I could not run away. A long time later, I took a deep breath, drew myself up and entered the place of my death. There she was, still standing over his body, the axe raised over her head. She didn't bring it down again. Instead she turned to me. Somewhere a servant screamed. She didn't move when I walked towards her. I only prayed, in a last invocation to Apollo, that it would be quick. Just one little step, and then it would be over. No more pain, no more gods. Only sweet death. I came to a halt before her, excepting the blow to fall. It didn't. She lowered the axe slowly, then it was crashing on the floor. The mad fury had vanished from her eyes. \"You didn't expect me to kill you.\" She raised her eyebrows. \"Did you?\" I found myself shaking my head in spite of myself. I knew what I had seen. But in this moment, I couldn't imagine how I could ever have believed it. \"My dear Cassandra.\" Her finger brushed my cheek, leaving a wet trail behind. \"All is well now. He can't hurt you any more.\" I gripped her wrist and pulled her hand away from me. \"You murdered him!\" \"So I did.\" She seemed unmoved. \"As he murdered my daughter. Now she is revenged.\" \"It is not for you to seek revenge.\" It was a horrible deed. I couldn't think of it any other way. She was sprinkled with blood. \"Why not? Because I am a woman?\" There was more truth in her question than I would admit. \"Because Iphigenia was not murdered, she was a sacrifice for the gods.\" \"So.\" She prodded his dead body with her foot. \"I sacrifice him to whatever god claims him. You are still speaking of the gods? Was it not a god who cursed and forsook you?\" \"He punished me,\" I said quietly. Then louder, \"As you will be punished.\" \"We all pay for our choices, my dear. What I did was something that had to be done. But let's not dwell on this any longer.\" She took my arm. \"I am sorry that you have seen this, you were supposed to be safe in your room now.\" I let myself be dragged away by her. I couldn't understand what was happening. I was supposed to be dead now. Was this the first time that I had been wrong? Had my mind tricked me into seeing something that was no prophetic vision? Whatever it was, I was still alive. So much had changed now. Suddenly, I had a future lying before me, a future unknown. My captor, my cruel slave master, was dead, so I suppose I belonged to her now. A part of me rejoiced that she killed him. I was free of him. But she was still a wife who had murdered her husband, and even if she seemed calm now, I remembered too well the slaughter I had witnessed. I was afraid of the madness that was hidden inside her. She led me through a door to a chamber with a huge tapestry which showed scenes of fighting heroes and gods quarreling with each other. At the wall there was a bench covered with yellow pillows. She gripped my shoulders and sat me down on the edge of it. She seated herself beside me and took my hand. I didn't draw it back when she began to stroke it. \"You know,\" she said softly, \"when I heard that he brought you with him, I was jealous. Furious that he would do that to his faithful wife and bring his love slave to my face. After I saw you, I was still jealous. But jealous because he could have you, not I.\" I was enraptured by her gaze. I was fascinated by this woman who could be so cruel one moment and so kind the next. I had never hoped to see kindness again, not in this place. A little earlier all I had hoped for was a swift death. Now she was luring me with the joys of life. \"What are you expecting of me?\" I said, and looked straight into her eyes. \"Nothing.\" She smiled, and I noticed for the first time how beautiful she was. Sister of Helen indeed. \"Nothing at all. I won't hurt you like he did. Trust me.\" Trust her. That was not an easy thing to do after I had seen her betrayal to her husband. Still, even if could fear her for it, even if I could dread the curse she had brought on herself, I couldn't be angry with her for saving me from him. \"I am glad that he is dead.\" \"He doesn't matter any more. Now it's just you and me.\" She let go of my hand and moved her fingers further up my arm; her touch was like silk on my skin. Then I gave way and sank into her embrace. My thoughts vanished, the world narrowed down to this moment, without a past or a future, no pain and no sorrow, just the closeness between us. She took a breath and rested her chin on my shoulder, our cheeks touching comfortably. \"Ah, sweet Cassandra, I love you.\" Suddenly it all came back to me. How often had she said these words to him? The fingers that were caressing my back were still sticky with his blood. My mind filled again with the picture of Clytemnestra, her eyes open wide, her hair disheveled, raw violence bursting from her, and an axe blow that landed deep in my flesh. I tried to shove it aside, tried to convince myself that I had escaped this fate and it was only a bad dream. But as much as I was longing for comfort, what was beginning here could not lead anywhere. I was still a slave; her power over me was complete. A traitorous part of me whispered that it didn't matter, that I should let myself be carried away by her promises. But I would be no more than a sheep meekly following her, depending on her whims. No, I had defied a god, so I wouldn't let myself be seduced by her. Whatever fate brings upon you, it never takes away your ability to make a choice. Someone had once said that to me, but I hadn't believed him. I believed now. \"No,\" I said, and backed away from her.",

    "text": "When you meet him, you forget your predicament. He is golden and lithe, wiry and graceful, an absolute terror with the grace of a god. His eyes are intense, and you feel like he is trying to see through you, inside you, see the exact kind of person you are. You are afraid that he will see and hate you for all the things you didn't mean to do, and for some reason you don't even know yourself, you desperately want him to like you. You train alongside him, and although you are older, he soon becomes much better than you. His potential seems limitless, and you think that he is truly a goddess's son, power simmering underneath human skin, elegant in everything he does, and so unreachable in every way. Yet somehow, you soon find yourself close friends with him, this almost immortal, and he is just like you in some ways, with a boy's dreams of war and honor and glory. His voice is excited when he talks about what he envisions for himself, a great warrior known by all, and there's a fire in his eyes that you can't name when he talks about having you by his side, always. You realize that because he is an almost-god, no one dares to touch him, and that's why he relishes you so much, the only close contact he has. You are glad that the Fates chose you to be the only one who can touch him, touch this handsome boy who is stronger than anything you have ever seen. You are always by his side, and you learn to know everything about him. You learn the way his hair flies when he races ahead of you, whispery and wild, the way he laughs as he waits for you at the finish line, clear and triumphant, and the way his words feel on your skin when he tackles you and pins you down, rushed and hot, and you think to yourself that you want this. The years pass by, and you forget that you used to be a prince yourself, that you haven't always been by his side, that you had a life before him. All you know are days filled with him. You train with him, you race him (and always lose), you wrestle with him, and when need be, you dress him in armor and undress him as well. You've become used to his weight on your body as he pins you down into the dirt, hands tight around your wrists, sweat running down his face, which is right above yours, breath hot against your skin and mingling with yours, and his chest moving up and down in the tiny space between your bodies, part of the steady rhythm that the two of you make. You also know the way his skin feels against your fingers, soft and smooth (but you know his hands are callused, like yours) and the way it glows gold in the light, sun-blessed and precious, and your touches always linger a little too long, but he never says anything. Sometimes, you pretend that he wants it, too; when you do that, you grow bolder, rest your hand against his skin and forget that he's not yours, that you're only fantasizing, and he lets you. He first kisses you after yet another race, when he has you pinned underneath him. You are surprised because you have never thought that he would possibly want you, a person so much lesser than him, a person who fell from princehood with so much disgrace, a person who will never shine the same way he does, when he can have anyone he wants, yet you are also not surprised at all because you have always known that he will be the one who kisses you first, he who is so much more daring than you. His tongue is clumsy, but so is yours, and the two of you fumble together in a first kiss, between the two of you and for each of you. He's grinning when the two of you break apart, and he gets off of you and pulls you to your feet. He tells you that he's wanted this for forever, and you tell him that you have, too. He takes you to his room, and he undresses you slowly, fingers lingering over your skin the same way yours have lingered over his. His mouth is warm and his tongue lazy, and he licks down your neck slowly, like he's licking up spilled honey from your skin. You push him down onto the bed and his tunic out of the way, and you lick your name across his chest, marking him as yours. You can feel his chest rise up and down in a constant, swift pattern, and you feel the need flowing through you faster and faster. You wrap your hands around his cock and stroke it the same way you've always stroked yourself while pretending it's him, and he thrusts at you, head thrown back and golden hair everywhere on the pillow, voice low and hoarse and needy as he calls your name. You lick his cock slowly, and the sound that he makes is unbelievably delicious and makes your head dizzy with want and need. You suck him clumsily, doing what you think he'll like and trying to figure out what he does like so you can make it good for him. His hands tangle in your hair and bring your head up, and when you look at him, face flushed and mouth open, you want him more than ever. He lets you take him, and he is unbelievably hot and tight. You have never thought that it would feel this good or be this arousing, the way he looks when you're inside him, with his eyes closed and sweat glistening like dewdrops on his perfect skin. Your name is a mantra on his lips, like you're everything that matters, and it becomes enough to send you over the edge, where it's just you and him, entwined together so tightly that the two of you will never be able to be separated. Later, he tells you that though he wishes the two of you could have met as princes, he's glad that it's like this because he wouldn't have had the chance to know you like this otherwise or be able to have you with him, always. When his father sends him to Chiron, he tells you to wait for him, always. You tell Achilles yes, always. You have forgotten you are a liar. 04.12.21",

    "text": "Anya hadn't wanted to stay and see another ascension especially now that she was mortal. She wanted to get as far away from Sunnydale, California as she possibly could. So she went to the other end of the country. Now, she was in a bar, a bar in Boston. The bartender walked over to her. \"What can I get you sweetheart?\" \"Sweetheart?\" Anya looked at him. He wasn't bad looking. He wasn't Xander, but he would do. \"I want orgasms. Can you give me orgasms?\" The bartender looked at her in surprise before smiling at her. \"Better than most.\" The bartender hopped over the bar and put his arm around her, \"name's Sam Malone.\" Anya looked at him closely before smiling. She knew his name. Everyone in her line of work knew his name. \"I know. I granted the wish that caused you to lose your hair.\" He looked at her in confusion as she pulled him out the door. Xander had just left her at the altar. Anya had to get away. Before, she knew it she found herself in a bar in Chicago. The bartender walked over to her, \"What can I get you?\" \"Orgasms,\" it worked in before. \"Right, Trevor it is one of yours!\" Trevor bounced over to her. \"Love is in the air. What can I get you? Blonde or Brunette?\" Anya looked up at him recognition lit her eyes. \"Cupid?\" \"Anyanka. It has been a while.\" \"What are you doing here in this bar?\" \"Being the Greco-Roman god of love for 3,000 years has prepared me for what? Desk job at Hallmark? I'm mortal I serve drinks. You?\" \"I make money, lovely, pretty money. Will you give me orgasms?\" \"No sex with the humans while I am in exile.\" \"I may be mortal again, but I am still not quite human.\" \"Really?\" Cupid grinned. Somewhere one of Cupid's beads slipped over marking the union of another couple. Anya was going to scream soon if Willow didn't knock it off with those time spells. She looked around trying to figure out where she was.She found she was on some sort of promenade that was filled with a lot of different kinds of demons she didn't recognize. She spotted a bar and walked in, usually bartenders were good sources of information and she had a lot of luck with them in the last few years. She sat at the bar waiting, when she noticed an odd looking book. She reached over and opened it. \"The Rules of Acquisition. Rule 1: Once you have their money, you never give it back.\" Her eyes were wide and she read the whole book. By the time Quark walked in to the bar, he found Anya crying. \"I have finally found where I belong!\" \"He acts like his head is always in the stars! You know what I wish?\" \"What? What do you wish?\" Anya was thrilled. This one was hurt and angry and she looked like a creative wisher. I wish he would fall off the face of the Earth, repeatedly, and know the heart-break I feel.\" Anyanka showed her true features \"Done.\" The woman who made the wish looked in terror at the face in front of her and Dr. Sarah Gardner promptly fainted. Elsewhere Dr. Daniel Jackson walked through the Stargate, off the planet for the first time, stumbling as he went, soon to meet Sha're. \"He doesn't love me.\" A woman sat talking with Anya. \"And what do you wish would happen?\" \"I don't know Mac is so handsome and smart. Maybe if he weren't so smart, such a free spirit, he could love me. Yeah, maybe if he were dumber.... yeah that is what I wish. I wish MacGyver would be dumber, less of a free spirit, and maybe even get a hair cut.\" The girl felt a hundred times better, even if she only knew MacGyver in passing. He should lover her. Anyanka smiled, \"Done.\" Elsewhere, Angus MacGyver had a sudden urge to join the Air Force.... \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\"(I am sorry, I know that is an implied Stargate: SG-1 ending and the \"Smart Jack\" people are all going to kill me, but I couldn't resist this one. Teri) Anya and Xander had yet another fight. Anya found herself on the road again. This time she went north, finding herself in yet another bar.She watched the bartender. He was an older man, but kind of cute and since she had been human she had found bartenders to be a constant source of... comfort. \"Sex on a beach.\" She offered. \"Sure, I can make that for you?\" The older man smiled as he began to mix the drink. Anya frowned; he misunderstood her. \"He didn't misunderstand you, he is just trying to not embarrass you.\" She turned to the deep voice in her ear. \"Methos!\" She smiled. \"Anyanka.\" \"You are a talented man. Cassandra's wish that you an eternal life alone. I never found a wish more gratifying since eternal means I get to run into you every few decades without worrying about you losing your head.\" \"A great PRIZE indeed.\" \"Lorne, what can you tell me?\" Angel asked. No, \"Hi\" or \"Hello\". He just walked in and got down to business. Lorne smiled at him. \"Well Angel-cakes, I can give you a cryptic thought for $10, a vague hint for $25, a decent hint for $50, a real clue for $75, and a plain description for $100.\" \"What?\" Angel was confused. \"Look, you people keep wrecking my bar and I needed to find away to keep repairing it.\" Lorne shrugged. \"So, I hired a financial consultant.\" \"Really?\" \"Yep, sweet girl, a little preoccupied with getting home to her boyfriend, but boy did she know Money. Maybe she could help you with your financial woes?\" \"Couldn't hurt. What's her name?\" \"Anya Jenkins.\" Anya was dancing around the Magic Box. Giles had never seen her so happy, except when they got their last tax refund. \"Anya, Why are you so happy?\" Dawn asked before Giles could. \"I finally met someone who has all the same goals in life I do. He is smart, funny, and most importantly understands the true value of life.\" Anya was glowing. \"Love?\" Dawn asked. \"No, Money. He loves money as much as I do.\" Dawn turned and grinned at Giles as a man came into the shop and walked over to Anya. He was a little short, but Dawn thought kind of cute. Anya turned, \"This is him. Giles, Dawnie, meet Alex P. Keaton!\" How could she be so foolish as to step in front of Andrew? What on earth was she thinking? Actually better question is, if she stepped in front of Andrew and died in his place, why was she able to ask questions. She opened her eyes. \"Welcome Anyanka. Blessed be.\" She looked over to a blonde man in golden robes, an elder. \"Why am I here?\" \"You died in a moment of self-sacrifice.\" Leo grinned at her. \"Welcome to the ranks of the Whitelighters.\" \"Me?\" She looked at him if he was crazy. \"I'm not crazy.\" She looked at him skeptically. \"I wouldn't put money on that, Leo.\" Cordelia Chase said from behind them both. The gang was standing outside of the bus, looking at the sinkhole that was Sunnydale. They were trying to decide what to do next. \"What are we going to do next Buffy?\" \"Well... \" Anya flashed in. \"Anya!\" Xander exclaimed as he moved to hug her. \"I thought you were dead?\" Was the thought shared by all of the others. \"I was, but Hades owed me. I am now the patron goddess of scorned women.\" Everyone stared at her, except Xander who just smiled. \"So, as for what I want to do... I want to build a temple, maybe something with a large gift shop so I can earn lots of money. Oh, I can't forget about temple tributes. This goddess thing is going to make me rich.\" She smiled widely. Now everyone just stared at her in amused confusion. Circa: Vietnam War\"I am so tied of them all hitting on me and chasing me like I am some sort of prize.\" A pretty young Army nurse complained to her friend. Anya grinned at her. \"Don't you sometimes wish they all would just go away?\" \"Well... \" \"Hey Suzie,\" A handsome young Lieutenant interrupted. \"You want to see the film with me tonight?\" \"No, I don't. Just like I didn't want to go last time either.\" The girl turned to Anya. \"Do you see what I mean? They don't leave me alone. I just wish that he knew what it was like to be chased like some kind of prize.\" Anyanka showed her true face. \"Done.\" Suzie looked on shock, but the Lieutenant never saw it. Instead he heard his commander's voice. \"Kid, change in plans. We got a mission from Morrison tonight.\" \"Sure, coming Hannibal.\" Face answered before leaving on the now infamous Hanoi Bank Job. I Dream of Anya... \"I just want a girl who is pretty and smart, very rich, and has the ability to change the world because I say 'I wish,'\" Roger shrugged. \"Is that to much to ask for, Tony?\" \"Rog, I told you before I am not going to let Jeannie set you up with anyone from her family and that's final.\" \"But, its me loveable Roger, aw, come on Tony. Just this once. Please!\" \"No,\" Tony shook his head Roger was always trying to get Jeannie to grant him some wish usually involving a girl. Some day all his scheming would get him into real trouble. Roger with a girl who could grant wishes, that had to be trouble. \"Besides, don't have that blind date tonight?\" \"Yeah, told her to meet me here.\" \"Here?\" Tony asked in surprise, \"why here?\" \"Well, I certainly don't want her to know where I live if it doesn't work out. Do I?\" \"Of course, not,\" Tony muttered as the doorbell rang. \"And I suppose you want me to answer the door for you too?\" \"It is your house.\" Tony was exasperated, but he went and answered the door. \"May I help you?\" \"I am here to see Roger Healey,\" the woman at the door answered with a big bright smile. \"I'm Anya.\"",

    "text": "The road twisted on ahead of me and her footfalls crunched softly over the wet gravel. A light rain was misting over us, as if we were standing near a waterfall. Dawn was near and I couldn't tell if it was getting lighter or darker, I couldn't tell much of anything, I just followed her as she walked in front of me. Her thick, delicate brown curls bounced with each step, a stray curl sticking to the pearls of water resting on her cheek when she turned her head to look and make sure I was following. I didn't know where we were going, nor did I ask. I simply followed in silent obedience, walking away from the din of the party behind us. She smiled, a curiously mischievous smile, a slight dimple gracing her lightly flushed cheek. She had a secret, she knew where we were going. I must admit, I wondered where she was taking me. It nagged at me, tugging at the back of my brain. But, I suppose, I was so caught up in the mystery of her, that I couldn't remember to ask. Slap, rustle, slap, snap, crunch, slap; her footsteps grew closer and faster, she was now running ahead of me, disappearing around one of the sharp bends in the path. I took a deep breath, trotting towards the curve. I stopped, my breath catching in my throat when I saw her. She twirled, arms outstretched and the first rays of morning sunlight fell over her face, catching the glistening tears of rain as they shimmied down her delicate cheeks. A giggle, child-like in nature, tripped over the infant plants, melodic fingers over the fine gold threads of morning's harp. She's beautiful... and I'm still not sure where we are or why I'm following her... I don't even know for sure who she is, but I trust her... I follow her. It wasn't until she reached her hand out for mine that I realized the rain had slowed to a stop. We were standing next to a lake, a light fog hovered inches above the water and it was perfectly still, even the fish dared not to come to the top in search of the mornings food, for fear of disturbing its perfection. She took my hand, leading me to the waters edge. We sat, silent for a long moment, a gasp in time, and I felt almost like a voyeur, Echo watching Narcissus and his perfect reflection in the pool, as I took in her splendor. The stillness of the hour overtook me in our silence and everything around me slowly sank in. There's something about that hour, I suppose, so close to dawn yet so far from day, that everything seems sharper. Perhaps it's the newness of day or the crispness of the air, but everything seems clearer... The sun as it peeks over the horizon, the faint chirping of the crickets as they sing their song, the fading sparkle of the stars as they succumb to the light and bow out gracefully... it's all there, beautiful and crisp, graceful as the stranger I am watching. \"Why did you come?\" her soft voice startled me in its sudden presence. \"I... I'm not entirely sure.\" A blush rose to my cheeks as her eyes rose from the mirror of water to look at me. \"There... I suppose there's just something about you, I couldn't help it.\" \"You needn't be embarrassed... I wanted you to follow me. You looked so sad and lost...\" She dipped a toe into the water, watching as the ripple reached out to embrace the far bank. \"Lost?\" \"You didn't belong back there... you were alone and going through the motions... out here you can be free and no one will care. It's almost like another world here. You're happier here. I can see it in your eyes.\" She leaned back on her hands, staring up at me intensely. I shook my head, this witch was casting a spell on me. \"Happier here, or happy with you?\" I couldn't stop the words from leaving my lips, but there they were. A slow smile played on her lips, \"Both... but I do see fear in the happiness... are you afraid of me?\" \"Not you... afraid of what lies ahead, what's unknown perhaps.\" \"No one can know what's coming. You just have to embrace it. Embrace what's being given to you, that is the key to happiness. There are things that you wont expect that pull you away, but if you don't follow, you may never find what you're destined to have.\" She shifted, sitting up and closer to me, now mere inches away. \"What would you have done if you hadn't followed me? Did you expect this to happen?\" \"Well, no, I--\" My words stopped when her lips, still soft and wet from the misting rain, met mine.She laughed again, the same playful melody, as she broke away. \"Just follow what you don't expect, and maybe there will be something amazing waiting for you.\"She curled close against me and I held my arms loosely around her small waist and stared out into the sunrise. Everything would change after that day, but from then on, I was willing to embrace it, and all because of her. \"People will think I'm crazy...\"\"So let them think. It doesn't matter as long as you're happy with what you are. So let's be crazy together.\"",

    "text": "Indian Summer had been rather early this year, they said. All along the Northeastern coast, the leaves had started turning the most stunning shades of red and yellow. A quick gust of wind, a gentle breeze, and the spacious forests of New England were practically ablaze with color. And every time a leaf decided to fall off from its branch, it would dance on the wind, the soft red and orange and yellow glinting in the soft hue of the September sun filtering through the canopy above. They spent these cozy days talking, taking long walks, savoring the fiery colors of the forest that so much mirrored the warmth they harbored in their hearts for each other. They were lovers bound by fate, treasuring the feel of each other's arms when they hugged, and each other's lips when they kissed, the comforting warmth of each other's body so very close. This was their time. And only their time. The soft wind blowing through the branches, making the trees sing and the fallen leaves dance - for them. For their love. They had come back here, to where they had both grown up. In the air, ripe with pine, they could still smell the sweet scent of fresh pumpkin pie his old granny had made. They just needed to close their eyes. How many times had they played hide-and-seek in these waves of gold and amber and ruby? How many times had they raced each other back to his granny's house? Fond memories... And now they had come back. Back to recover and treasure all these fond memories. They had married here. It had been exactly one year and two days ago. He had worn a formal black tuxedo with a gold and red cummerbund. She had worn a beautiful white dress, with red and golden leaves woven into her hair. They had stood here, in the middle of the forest, before the priest, to come back out of it to his granny's house - as husband and wife. They couldn't believe they had been together that long already. For them it seemed like yesterday. Their love was still as fresh as on the very first day. That fateful first day in Indian Summer... Whenever they thought back to that day a warm, fond smile would light both their faces, and they would wrap their arms around each other, feeling the other's closeness, breathing in their scent, their lips tenderly touching, meeting each other... The fallen leaves beneath their feet made soft, rustling noises. Whispers of a melody only the gentle breeze knew. They held each other tight, her face nestled in the soft folds of his auburn sweater. Soon, they would have to get back to work and grey everyday life would hold them firmly in a tight grip. She needed to be back tomorrow. He had to stay here for another day. They would have to take different flights back to the city. He had already persuaded her to stay a while longer, to take a later flight... It was early in the morning when he brought her to Logan Airport. He wanted to kiss her goodbye, wanted to see her safely off to her flight back to New York. It was a deep and warm kiss - and suddenly, one last time, the air was filled with the scent of the forest, of pine and pumpkin pie... He told her one last time that he loved her, and that he would see her soon, before she disappeared through security. He never saw her again. It was September 11th, 2001.",

    "text": "The last goodbye had come, and my sight blurred, hot tears stinging in the corners of my eyes. I just could not believe it. There she was, to take me back to pick up my old life again, just as out-of-the-blue as I had left it. It seemed ages that I had last seen the sun. But Eurydice was here, and if I went with her, I would soon see it again... On the other hand, I would not go unchanged by the last... was it days? Was it months? Or even only mere hours? I was not the same man that had come here. I knew the sweet Eurydice had a crush on me. That was probably why she had come here in the first place. Not because she felt responsible. Not because of her dear brother. She knew that he would send her to get me, as she knew her way around men like Charon and Cerberus. Not around me, though. She knew I was off-limits to her as long as I shared her brother's bed. I watched my feet, setting one in front of the other, automatically, on the cool obsidian floor, walking behind her. Little Eurydice led me all the way back to the surface, back to the sun, back to her brother. The quiet sound of feet in front of and behind me echoed in my ears. When I first came down here, I wanted to go back to my one and all - wanted to go back to the surface. But I could not. A firm grip on my shoulder held me back. He did not say anything, but when I turned around this first time to look at him, the stoic authority on his features told me that I had to stay. His name was Hades, I was told later. The grave silence he radiated gave the Underworld a very ceremonial, sacred aura, somehow. The darkness that sometimes felt so heavy, so devoid of emotions, would seem soft and warm, in a way. In a world of death and misery, a tiny spark of life could seem like a flame. And I became this spark's worshipper, high priest, and slave. When I thought back now, I had been nothing more than a young boy. I had thought I knew about life, I had thought I knew about the world. The force that drew me, like a moth towards a candle, was utalitarian, at first. Back in my old life, it was poetry, passion, and the pursuit of enjoyment. I found it all in this one nymph; the brother of the woman that was walking in front of me now. Or so I thought. When I met Hades, I was still devastated, still mourning about my lost life and love on the surface. Like now, I had to blink back the salty tears threatening to overwhelm me. But I stubbornly bit back on all the hopelessness, all the loss I felt, and looked the silent man in the eyes. My shoulders hunched, I did not feel like feel like calming down. Still, I tried to muster a strong posture, a proud decisiveness - and ended up with such a grimace on my face that it made the man opposite me pull up one corner of his mouth in a diminuitively small, wry smile. He turned away and left again. I had made a complete fool of myself. But I would not give up. I soon realized that the only way out, back to the surface, back to the sun, was through Hades. I had to convince him to let me go - by any means necessary! I washed, I waited on him, I cleaned the place, ever getting myself deeper into his realm without noticing. Until not too long ago, when my libido won the better of me. So it must have been quite a while that I was down here... I thought that I must have ruined everything I had been working for in that one single instant! I could have killed myself if I had not been dead already then! I would have to stay in the Underworld forever,... alone and in eternal silence. Why was he following me now, then? Or was I just following his will all along? I would go back to the surface, repenting for my mistakes. I could not turn around. Not ever again! As much as I wanted to, I was far too proud - towards Eurydice as well as myself. The dark silence around me still echoed with the hollow steps around me - with the sweet light of the sun not too far ahead - with the wet clouds of mist in front of my eyes. A faint whisper penetrated my ears. \"... only gods and those they want and choose to can experience life in their dead bodies...\" Had I been led out of the Underworld just tu reach Morpheus's arms? I stopped dead in my tracks. Eurydice turned and gave me a long, sad look. She knew something I did not; of this I was sure. Then I could see her eyes shifting to look at the man behind me. Hades. My tormentor, my master, my lord, my flame... So the big goodbye would be longer than I had expected. Slowly, I turned to face him. So the voice I had just heard was his... I felt Eurydice's curious eyes on me, when, finally, the meaning of the words spoken sank in...",

When I was a child I loved the sun, and my father, knowing this, told me never to look into it, for it would harm me. But one day I did. I tested him as all children test their parents' decrees, and because I could not bear not to look. I looked into the sun, and it seemed to fill my vision until my eyes longed to close, yet I could not look away. And then, out of the sun's glare stepped a man. He was tall to my child's eyes, with hair that shone bright true gold, and eyes as blue as the cloudless sky that day, and his body was the sun-kissed bronze of an athlete, with no clothing to mar it. I looked at him then, and I knew he was no mortal man. He spoke to me, that day years ago. He asked my name, and patted my head, and told me I was a brave boy for daring to look into his face. I looked into the eyes of my god, as I had looked into the sun, and I was not afraid. I knew he would never harm me. Then I blinked, and he was gone. I can still see him if I close my eyes and call up the memory, as clearly as if he were standing before me now. Every time I see the sun, I remember. One day I will see him again, and he will take me in his sun-warm embrace, and then- Well, then, we shall see. Father is building wings to carry us away from this prison the King has made, wings to carry me into the sky, into my destiny. It will be dangerous, he says, I should not fly too close to the sun - but I know him, as I have for years. He will not harm me.",

He would have savored it more, instead of wasting it with arguing about joining or not joining the fight. He would certainly not have wasted a single thought on Briseis. Not when the precious last hours with the one who had been part of him long before her, were fleeing much too quick. He would have forgotten everything. Everything, except for Patroclus and the touch of his hands. The taste of his body, the shining of his eyes and the words of affection he whispered when he thought his lover was asleep. But Achilles had not known. And of all the things that made him mad with grief and anger this waste was among the most bitter. He had sent Patroclus out to fight in his armour; with barely a nod, barely a good wish or a prayer. Achilles had never been a praying man, but now he wished he had prayed, just this once, for the safekeeping of the one he loved. He had never been one to make grand declarations of love, but now he wished he had told Patroclus that he loved him better than any other, man or woman. There had been a moment last night, when the heat of their argument had made Patroclus' eyes burn. When his whole body was tense with passionate anger, and Achilles had found himself tempted to banish Briseis from his tent for the night. His beloved was always beautiful, but never more so than when roused to a burning fury. Achilles forgot about his strife with Agamemnon long enough to think about twisting that fury until Patroclus pushed him down on the rugs and took him, his anger transformed. It would have been a different fire and would have ended with warmth and tenderness, instead of coldness and compromise. Briseis offered another kind of tenderness, not quite as soul-possessing and burning, and Achilles had chosen her. After all, Patroclus would always be there at his side, gods willing. It was Achilles' mistake that he had not considered that the gods' will might, for once, not be the same as his own and he would forever regret his arrogance. With eyes dry from too much anguish Achilles watched the flames take his beloved's body. He was almost jealous of them, and envied them the privilege of that final caress, which should by right have been his. His throat raw from too many screams, Achilles mutely saw what had once been Patroclus disappear forever. Achilles had not known that this was their last night together, and soon all that was left of it was ashes and memories of a fire.",

    "text": "If the war ends tomorrow, I will ride into Troy -- not victor, but guest -- and speak with him, neither spear nor sword between us. We'll take two horses from the stables and ride east, leaving the corpse-sown plain behind us. In the east... but there's Patroclus. There's Briseis, his cousin. And he has a son, and a wife. He is a prince of Troy: he is not free. We'll take two horses from the stables and ride east, together. I'll muster the Myrmidons: Hector shall bring the finest of the Apollonian Guard. There are cities to the east that have never been conquered. Together we will find glory. He will fight at my shoulder, I will be the armour of his back. There will be none who can stand against the two of us. At night... well. We are equals, he and I, matched in strength and age and rank. Perhaps we'll throw the dice each evening, or toss a coin, to decide who plays the girl. I wouldn't mind. For him. If the war ends tomorrow, I will ride out to the beach, while the Greeks load their black ships, and speak with him before his tent. I'll bid him stay. He has a kingdom to rule, I know: but his counsellors know of governance. His cousin is dear to him, they say. He might reign in Achilles' stead, for a year or two. But Troy is no place for Achilles. It is a cage. Perhaps we'll found a new city. There's a river-delta, east along the coast, where olive trees grow and the hunting is good. He and I will rule there, and our sons after us. Any woman would be proud to be his wife. Andromache will love him, too. How could she not? He is my brother: the same blood flows in our veins, though it's Paris who grew to manhood with me. And sometimes, at night, when we are alone -- hunting, or riding out to learn the land -- it will come to just the two of us, tussling together like lion-cubs or little boys. Sometimes I'll let him win. I could have loved you: but I loved my cousin Patroclus, and his life's blood is on your sword. I did not see you fight. I don't know if he fought as valiantly as you deserve. His ashes are cooling now, but something within me is still on fire, and it will be quenched only when my sword is sheathed in your heart. I don't know why I cannot weep. I loved Patroclus. I would never have permitted him to meet you in combat. He is -- he was too young to make the journey across the Styx. Yet, brother, I weep for what now can never be: and it is not only Patroclus' future glories that died in the dust yesterday, but yours. You must die, and I must kill you: but I never wanted your death, until I saw his. I could have loved you, but when -- as I thought -- you came at me, your sword already red, I fought you honourably, as I would fight any foe in battle. When I slew you, the sickness rose in me for what I had spoilt. When I lifted the helm from your face and saw that it was not you who lay dead at my feet, I rejoiced. I did not know the dead man's name. He looked like you, a little: he was fair, and very young. If you and I met in combat, it would have been glorious. This was butchery. When they told me the boy's name, I knew that you would have vengeance. We would meet one more time, this side of the Styx. Death is the opposite of everything I wanted from you. Death parts us, for a little while. Your blind, deaf shade is scurrying down to Hades, lost on the riverbank, crying in the dark for any that will guide you to the ferryman. Only wait a little while for me. I will be your guide. Everything is dark and quiet, and there is no pain any more. I am waiting for the wave to break against the shore. When you weep, though, I can hear it; your tears feel like fire. The other bank of the river is crowded with men, all staring at the two of us. Some of them are men I have slain: some I do not know, though you look at them with pity. So many of them, an army: yet they have no weapons, and there is nothing warlike in their eyes. Their eyes are dead. I can hear oars rippling the cold, black water. Soon we'll pay the ferryman and cross to the other side. But here, while we are still quick, and the coins in our hands are warm from our funeral pyres -- while we remember who we were -- I can smile, and call you brother, and speak of what might have been. They will remember our names, when we have drunk of Lethe: but there will be no one to remember this. -end-",

    "text": "There comes a time in everyone's life where normal becomes boring and a distraction must be sought. Even gods suffer this, although, being gods, they're not allowed to make a big song and dance about it, because if even gods can get bored, where does that leave mortals? Aphrodite was bored. She visited the oracles at Delphi and listened to wisdom about the future, which ranged from the fact that all the gods would be known forever, to one rather deluded priestess's pronouncement that the world bounced -- she might have been sitting too long in the smoke of the trance-fires. She went down to the Elysian Fields of the underworld and watched the shades of the dead at their revels. She wandered the world, seeing mountains and streams, deserts and seas, grasslands and the wide white stretches of the snowy North. And at last she came to a forest glade, where a young woman was sitting on a rock, stringing a silver bow. 'Who is it who walks in my mountains?' the maiden asked, rising to her feet and looking Aphrodite fearlessly in the eye. 'Don't you know who I am?' Aphrodite asked. 'I am Aphrodite, goddess of love.' 'Then we are well met,' the maiden said, putting her bow down. 'For I am Artemis, and there are those who call me the goddess of the moon, amongst other things.' 'Artemis,' Aphrodite mused. 'Yes, I know you.' She indicated the rock beside Artemis. 'May I join you?' 'For a while,' replied Artemis. 'But soon I hunt, and your heart must be very strong to face the joy of the hunt.' 'Believe me, I would take great delight in joining you,' Aphrodite said. 'I have had little to do with hunting, though, and I don't wish to scare your prey away.' 'Then walk silently with me,' said Artemis, 'and I will try and show you the way of the hunt.' She rose once more, bow properly strung, and drew an arrow from its quiver. 'This way.' Artemis walked as softly as a whisper under cover of the natural sounds of the forest. Her feet left no marks, and she was constantly alert, looking from left to right, above and below. Aphrodite wasn't sure what to watch for, and so when Artemis stopped abruptly in front of her she almost ran into the maiden's back. 'Hush,' Artemis said, raising one hand. She pointed. 'Through those bushes. A fine stag. See him?' Aphrodite looked and saw a flash of white between the trees as Artemis raised her bow. 'No.' Artemis looked puzzled. 'But this is the way of the hunt... to kill.' Aphrodite held out her hands towards the stag, who lifted his head and then moved towards them, and though he surely saw the silver bow in Artemis's hands, he did not stop until his head nudged against Aphrodite's hand, and she stroked his head and scratched behind his magnificent antlers. 'That is a clever trick,' Artemis said. 'But it would take away the fun of the chase if I were to do it.' 'Then you shouldn't do it,' Aphrodite said. She turned to Artemis. 'Your domain is the hunt. It's quite different to mine.' 'But not in every way,' Artemis pointed out. 'Some women pursue men, some men pursue women.' 'True.' Aphrodite looked keenly at Artemis, who did not blush under her gaze, but looked back unwaveringly. 'But you don't pursue men.' 'Why should I? What good is a man to a huntress? My love is for the hunt, not for any mortal. A huntress must be focused on the hunt, not on the attentions of some slovenly being. I wish Callisto had remembered that, but she didn't.' Aphrodite didn't ask who Callisto was. She knew the story. 'But what if it were another's attentions?' Artemis looked blank, and Aphrodite elaborated. 'What if a woman sought the attentions of a huntress?' Now Artemis understood, and only now did she blush. It was rather becoming. 'Then... then... I don't know.' Aphrodite put one hand on Artemis's shoulder and laid one light kiss upon her lips. 'You know where to come if you ever wish to find out,' she whispered, and in a breath was gone.",

Whenever they're near each other, Hector can imagine Paris watching his every move, the same way predators stalk their prey. When he first saw Paris, Hector likened him to a feline, like one of the big cats some faraway king had brought as a gift many years ago. Paris was sleek and lean, and in his eyes Hector had seen calm calculation that made him wonder who exactly the other was and what exactly he wanted. Even then, Hector felt Paris scrutinizing him, though it had never been as intense and determined as it is now. Hector supposes that a married man, no matter how attractive he may be, cannot compare to a woman already promised by a goddess, especially if the man is his brother. Hector has only ever truly looked at Paris once. The first time he saw Paris, Hector was blinded by Paris's brilliance, and he resolved to never look upon Paris closely again because Paris hurts his eyes. Paris tries to seduce him, but Hector refuses to fall into his brother's traps. Paris is too golden, too vain, too soft for him, and Hector thinks that he would rather die than let Paris win. But that doesn't mean he doesn't imagine it's Paris he's fucking when Andromache lies beneath him. 04.03.07",

    "text": "You cannot sleep. You lie in your extravagant bed alone, you, Alexandros, the fairest man this side of the Aegean Sea. Helen has not touched you in years; she hates you for taking her away from Menelaus. You don't love her, either. He presses heavily against you, tan fingers digging into your golden thighs, and you can almost see the purple bruises that will appear the next morning. You try to touch him, but he only bats your hands away before clutching your thighs again. \"I hate you,\" he tells you You only ever loved him. You never loved Oenone or Helen...only him. You think you should have stuck with one of them, probably Oenone since she loved you, because neither of them are your brother, and that makes all the difference and you know he doesn't, you know he loves you. Everyone loves you, or loved, anyway, except for Cassandra, and he is no exception. He welcomed you when you first appeared at the palace in your shepherd drags, and even when you brought Helen back and earned yourself disapproval from some, he never did anything but love you and support you. The only difference with him is that you love him back because only your brother can hurt you this much. Sometimes, you wish you never fell in love with Hector. His widow is still in mourning, but you, who love him the most, received your entire share when the funeral games ended. You are the only person left to command the army, and you wish you fought more when Hector was still alive and you know he knows that as well. He continues. \"I hate you for foolishly bringing Helen to Ilium just because Aphrodite promised her to you. I hate you for charming me so much that I didn't force you to take Helen back to Sparta so that she won't bring war upon us. I hate you for turning to me when she abandoned you. I hate you for making me love you so that I can't hate you,\" he utters lowly, sliding into you faster and rougher, and you know now that he isn't lying, that he loves you but hates you at the same time. \"I can't believe I'll die because of you,\" he growls instead of charming your way out of everything in order to live a life of idleness and luxury. But you still had Helen then, and by the time you lost her, no one came to ask you to fight anymore. They all still loved you, of course, because you are Paris, but Hector was the only one who really cared about you. At least, he was the only one who actually came to you when Helen left you. And now, you have no one. You don't have Oenone or Helen and especially not the only person you ever loved, and you think that maybe you deserve all this because it is your fault, anyway, that any of this happened. You caused everything, so you really shouldn't be surprised that you would lose in the process as well, even with Aphrodite's protection. and you arch up into him as he says, \"Because I killed Patroclus, Achilles won't let me live.\" With one last thrust, you are coming, and he says then, \"I won't live to see tomorrow night. All because you made me too weak to order the return of Helen,\" and when you finally regain enough senses to open your mouth in protest, he covers it brutally with his own. He releases you with the taste of blood in your mouth, and he tells you, \"Never again, Paris. You can't charm me anymore.\" He turns away from you, and though you reach for him, he doesn't see. He doesn't want to see. He doesn't turn back, just dresses himself and leaves you by yourself in your bed, and you think that maybe he doesn't know that you love him, after all, that you are in love with him. You finally manage to sleep a few hours before a servant awakens you, and when you dismiss him, you gaze at the armor laid before you, the armor that you must wear now that your brother is gone. You touch each piece and wonder how your brother felt, sweating under them in the sun, blood staining the shining metal plates. You put your armor on slowly, and when you finish, you gaze into the mirror and know that you don't fit within the confines of war. Your golden, smooth skin contrasts sharply with the cold hardness of the armor, and you are reminded of the scars and calluses on Hector that you used to lick as he slowly stripped himself of his armor. Hector was a warrior; you are nothing but a soft prince. You watch when Achilles strikes your brother down, watch your brother's glorious form fall under the wrath of a goddess's son, and you can almost hear your brother telling you again that he hates you, that you are the reason he won't live to see the sun set this day. When Achilles drives around the city with your brother's corpse tied to the chariot, you turn away from the dust beginning to cover Hector's handsome figure. The spectators on the walls weep, and though you yourself do not, you think that they have no reason to cry at a hero's death when only you ever loved him the way he deserved to be loved. No one stops you when you leave for your rooms, too caught up in their own grief and despair at the seemingly inevitable doom of Troy to even notice you slipping away. You don't cry; you don't know how to because you have never before had an occasion to do so. You only hope Hector forgives you You stand upon the city walls, and you can discern Achilles by the godly armor he wears. You think of your dead brother's beautiful body burned at the pyre, think of how you will never again see the sunlight glinting off of your brother's armor as he fights, and you want nothing but revenge for the death of the only person you ever loved. You know Phoebus Apollo favored Hector, and you pray he may help you, too. The thick dust before Troy rises as the day's battle begins, and you whisper to the glint of gold shining through the hazy cloud at irregular intervals, \"Dust you are, and to dust you shall return.\" because though you caused his death, you will also avenge him. He is the only person you ever loved, and He is the only person you will ever love. 04.02.24",

    "text": "There were decidedly too many people in Tyndareus' hall, Odysseus thought. It was noisy and odorous, and although it was full of great men, the more Odysseus grew to know them, the lesser they seemed. Agamemnon liked to pinch the slave girls. Now, what one does in his own palace is his business, but to ogle so blatantly in another man's home is simply tacky, especially when one's purpose for being in said home is to win a wife. Of course, if Helen minded, she didn't show it. In fact, if Helen felt anything other than gracious amusement, she didn't show it. She sat at Tyndareus' right hand every day, smiling at all the men and carefully showing favor to none. Odysseus leaned back in his seat and considered going home. \"Sort of a crock, isn't it?\" The speaker was a dark-haired girl several feet behind him, who Odysseus vaguely recognized as Helen's cousin. She was not speaking to him, but to Helen's sister Clytemnestra. \"I suppose,\" Clytemnestra replied. \"I mean, we put dozens - scores - of men up here for Zeus-knows-how-long until Uncle Tyndareus finally decides which one wins Helen. Within a year, our new brother-in-law is killed and the whole business starts all over again.\" \"Perk up, Penelope,\" Clytemnestra said cheerfully. \"We'll probably get husbands out of it, too.\" \"Mmm,\" Penelope said. \"Better get back to the table. Your father wants us to retain an aura of aloofness, and I think that red-haired fellow is eavesdropping.\" Odysseus hastily busied himself with eating until the two women were safely seated beside Helen. He caught Clytemnestra's eye and smiled, and was pleased when she smiled back. There were other potential wives here, he realized, and ones that carried much less risk than the most beautiful woman in the world. ** He watched the two girls for four days before deciding that Penelope was the one for him. Clytemnestra was rather too unbalanced, or so it seemed from where he stood: she glared daggers at Agamemnon when he drank the last of the winecask, and actually shouted at Diomedes for bad table manners. Odysseus couldn't imagine life with her in Ithaca; either he or she would kill the other before the year was out. However, he could very happily imagine settling down with her cousin - he was surprised at just how happily. The more he watched Penelope, the more he appreciated her quiet intelligence (and sometimes outright wiliness). He was pleased with the skill with which she deflected the suitor's questions about Helen's intentions. She never lied outright, but kept hope alive in all of them so that Tyndareus made no enemies. It was, he thought, a trick almost worthy of himself. Two days later, he noticed her at her loom and she so resembled Athena that the deal was done. The next time her saw her, she was chattering in the gardens with Helen and Clytemnestra. Odysseus straightened his shoulders, steadied his breathing, and approached the trio. \"Penelope,\" he said, \"may I speak with you where others may not overhear?\" \"Of course, King Odysseus,\" she said, smiling. She turned to her cousins. \"Please excuse us.\" Her voice was softer than it had been when she was talking to the women, and more flirtatious. Odysseus took another steadying breath and led her to a shaded marble bench. Before he could speak, Penelope took his hand in hers and gazed into his eyes. \"My cousins are honored that you grace their home with your presence,\" she said huskily. \"They are impressed with your bravery, to have journeyed so far from, ah-\" \"Ithaca,\" Odysseus supplied, amused. Penelope's eyes widened, and she clasped his hand more fervently. \"Ithaca! It is a great and distant land indeed! We have heard tales of its fabled, er-\" \"Mostly rocks, actually,\" Odysseus said. Penelope put her hand on his arm and lowered her voice ever further. \"No matter what your land has to offer,\" she said, \"I feel certain that my cousin looks on you with favor.\" Odysseus peered over her shoulder. \"Is that why she's kissing Menelaus behind that apple tree?\" Penelope whirled around and stared. \"She's - oh, that Helen, she's trying to make you jealous! Ha! Ha! What a minx!\" \"It's-\" Odysseus began to say, It's all right, but a sudden thought occurred to him. \"It's terrible,\" he said fervently, watching Helen and Menelaus and glowering darkly. \"I can't believe the audacity of that man! Here is the woman I hope to marry, and he's kissing her in the garden! How she toys with my heart! Oh, Aphrodite! How fickle a creature you have made woman!\" He considered shaking his fist at the heavens as a finishing touch, but thought that might be a bit overdoing it. He turned back to Penelope, who was looking at him with a raised eyebrow and a rising smile. \"I may have to reconsider my opinion of you,\" she said. The huskiness was gone from her voice; she spoke in a clear and pleasant timbre. \"Please do,\" he said cheerfully. \"I don't think you intend to marry my cousin at all,\" she said. \"Not a bit.\" \"And in that case, your intentions in drawing me aside to speak in private-\" \"Are effectively the same as those of Menelaus,\" Odysseus said. Penelope's smile was luminous. \"I'd hoped so.\" ** After three days of langorous glances across the table, secret tete-a-tetes, and shared jokes, the pair encountered their first stumbling block. \"My uncle won't hear of anyone marrying before Helen,\" Penelope announced. She and Odysseus sat on the grassy hill overlooking Tyndareus' orchards. \"I imagine that Clytemnestra and I are to be consolation prizes for unsuccessful suitors.\" \"I'll have to win my way into his good graces, then,\" Odysseus said. \"What does he need more than anything?\" Penelope rested her cheek in her hand and contemplated the view below her. \"At the moment, a way to get Helen safely off his hands. He can't choose anyone straight off, not even Agamemnon, because the others would attack her husband and probably here as well.\" \"So he needs two things: a way to choose who Helen marries, and a way to ensure that the ones not chosen will accept the choice.\" \"Quite.\" \"Well, then,\" Odysseus said smugly, \"I should think the solution would be obvious.\" \"Enlighten me.\" \"Helen chooses.\" Penelope thought. \"It does free my uncle from any political influences,\" she said. \"But to keep the others from attacking Menelaus?\" She drummed her fingers on her cheek. \"The best way to get a man to do anything is to encourage him to hope,\" she said. \"We have to keep all of the suitors thinking that they have a chance, and that's why they should - no, I've lost it.\" Odysseus leapt to his feet. \"Swear an oath!\" he cried. \"We make all the suitors swear an oath to defend Helen and her husband, if the need should arise. They have to do it before Helen chooses, so that she could really pick any of them. Or so they hope.\" She was on her feet too, now, giggling happily. \"And what to do about the wise, cunning king who devised this brilliant plan, and was so dreadfully spurned by the lady in question?\" \"He'll have to content himself with the lady's cousin, I suppose,\" Odysseus said solemnly. \"Shame she's not so bright.\" \"Shame he's not so handsome,\" Penelope said. \"They'll learn to live with each other, I suppose.\" \"Eventually,\" she agreed. They walked hand-in-hand back to the palace.",

    "text": "1. To Purchase Freedom When the sailor tossed the odd gold coin at him, in careless thanks for carrying a cask of wine to the docks, he thought it was his first, bright step to freedom. That night, he dreamed of his old home, dense and green and alive. He dreamed of his woman, twelve years sold, and the child she had been about to bear. Four years later, he's crouched by candlelight, counting coins. He's halfway to his price, and he's singing. When his master screams, he thinks to himself that he might not need to buy his freedom after all. And then they come. 2. The Dark is Rising Will turns the page again, and he's plunged into a swordfight, and an uneven one at that. A pirate--no, a skeleton--hacks away at a baker's weak defenses, and Will sees the baker die. A golden coin gleams on the table behind him, and his wife bleeds underneath it. Another curse, another flurry of untimely and unjust deaths; he's seen them, endlessly, turning these pages. The last of the Old Ones will see dozens more before his time is over. Hundreds, even. What makes this curse different is that it was broken. Irrelevant history. Perhaps. Will turns the page. 3. Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart The pirates found the coin, far from its point of origin. Across the sea and deep in a forest, the rhythmic pulse of the gold called to them. They trudged to a remote shack, smelling of dust and coal. There had been a man living there; locals claimed him a murderer. He raved and screamed of justice as he died. They were used to that. Such was the gold's call. Following its summons, they pried loose the cabin's floorboards. They found, beneath the planks, a still-beating heart. And beneath that the coin, amidst its plainer cousins. The heart stopped when they removed the coin. They left the rest of the gold scattered on the floor. 4. Farscape \"And then what happened?\" \"And then little Frankie watched his daddy get stabbed in the gut. And the pirate took the coin and left, never to be seen again.\" John nodded, satisfied with a story well told. \"So what does that tell you?\" Chiana twitched her shoulders. \"To carry a blaster if I'm gonna be attacked by pirates?\" \"No, Chiana.\" John held up the locket. \"The moral of the story is you shouldn't steal!\" \"But it's for a present!\" \"It could be dangerous! It could cursed!\" \"It's just a frelling necklace, Crichton.\" She snatched the locket back with ease. \"And we're already cursed, anyway.\" 5. Witchblade Set during the first season. \"You want me to find what?\" \"My employer has had trouble finding a dealer able to obtain one of the items.\" Nottingham fingered a bronze reliquary, recently dusted. \"Despite your youth, you've proved valuable in the past. He thought you might be able to locate the coins.\" \"No. No way.\" Gabriel snatched the statue, supposed to have carried a minor saint's foreskin, from the man's gloved hands. \"Those things are bad mojo. Cursed.\" \"Cursed.\" It wasn't a question. \"I read about a collector, decades ago, who found one on a dig.\" Gabriel's hands jittered against the bronze. \"He died under mysterious circumstances, two weeks later. Mysterious, as in stabbed repeatedly.\" \"Pity.\" \"There's no way I'm doing this job. No way.\" Nottingham half-smirked, raised his hands in surrender. \"That's unfortunate.\" His coat swirled as he exited the shop. \"He had looked forward to doing business with you.\" Gabriel returned the case to its shelf with a sigh. \"Irons is going to get me killed someday.\" 6. Angel: the Series She was a sweet thing when they met. Small and golden, with skin like milk. He thrust into her for what seemed like years, and she moaned like a dying woman the entire time. He paid her in gold, told her she deserved her weight in it. She smiled, simpered as she traced the skull's face with her fingers. Years later, he's the walking dead, and he finds her crouched in an alley over a dead body. He surprises her by moonlight, runs her through with a blade before taking the coin. He leaves her body slumped against the wall. He doesn't see her eyes open, flashing fire, and he doesn't see her face change shape. When he returns to the Pearl, the coin is clutched in his right hand. He needs one of his shipmates to help him reattach the hand to his arm. 7. Gargoyles The Magus spends much of his time at the shores of their island, watching the waves. He doesn't expect much except respite from the rowdy hatchlings, and the princess and her lover. One day, he notices an unusual glitter on the beach, wavering under the steady rush of the sea. Scholar at heart, protector by choice, he investigates. Could it be a token of the islands' true inhabitants? A message from the outside? He walks to the water, crouches to the sand. It is a coin, large and intricate. The skull on its face seems to grin at him. He reaches out to touch it, and draws back with a hiss. Cursed. It is rare to find a talisman of real power on their magic-barren isle, but the Magus doesn't want this wretched thing. He sends it, floating on a piece of driftwood, back into the mists. 8. CSI \"God.\" Sara stares at the skeleton, at its arms outstretched, unnaturally. \"How'd the murderer get it to age so quickly?\" Nick squats next to it and pokes a rib with his latex-gloved hand. \"The bones are scoured pretty clean. Acid, maybe?\" He looks to Grissom for verification. \"No. Age is the culprit here.\" Grissom smiles, enigmatically as always. \"By all rights, this should be an archaeology dig.\" \"That old?\" Sara steps closer to the body. \"Why are we here, then?\" \"Same's always--911.\" Nick stands, dusts his hands together. \"Someone reported a skeleton, so they send in the criminalists.\" \"It could be centuries old, for all we know.\" Grissom points out the artifacts surrounding the skeleton: a sword, long rusted, some tacky looking jewelry, a couple of buckles lying by its ankles. \"So, we're done here, right?\" Sara sheds her gloves. \"Not necessarily, Sara.\" Grissom holds up a hand. \"Look at the position of the arms, and the grooves on the ribs.\" Sara catches on, jumps in. \"The phalanges of his right hand are broken.\" Grissom nods. \"Exactly.\" Nick shakes his head, confused. \"What're you saying, Gris?\" \"This man was murdered. For something important.\" 9. Finding Nemo Marlin's still sleeping, and the kids are eating, and Dory's bored. \"Crush?\" The turtle swings his head to gaze at her. \"Yeah, Little Blue?\" \"Have you ever seen a pirate?\" \"Yeah.\" A frown, unusual, crosses Crush's face. Dory feels scared, seeing that. \"Crush?\" \"Yeah, Little Blue?\" \"What did you see? Did they...hurt someone?\" Crush turns his gaze back to the EAC. \"Harshly.\" \"Was it for treasure?\" \"It's always for treasure, little fish. Always.\" Dory wants to ask what kind of treasure, but the kids swim over and ask to her to play hide and seek with them. Soon, she forgets that she and Crush had even talked about pirates. 10. A Knight's Tale The crowd roars at his first address, and a thrill runs through his veins as he shouts to them. \"Today you are privileged to witness the grace and glory of my lord, a man who I once saw defend a humble child--a pretty peasant girl with no mother--from the ravages of a dreadful and mercenary pirate! A pirate intent on not only robbing the child of her innocence, but also of the only coin she had in the world!\" The crowd gasps appropriately, hissing at the conjured image of the pirate. \"When that filthy rat of the sea advanced on that ragged, angelic girl, my lord galloped to her rescue, saving her from that monster's foul attentions, and--\" \"Geoff!\" William grinds out his name from the sidelines, in harmony with Wat's shouted promise, \"Pain!\" Chaucer halts his story and smiles. \"I present to you today the Seeker of Serenity, the Protector of Italian Virginity, the Slayer of Foul Pirates, and the Enforcer of Our Lord God: the one, the only, Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein!\" The people scream in delight as William rides to defeat yet another fop on horseback. Chaucer leans back on the fence and smiles at Wat. \"Was that true?\" Wat mumbles to him. \"That story you told?\" \"Almost.\" Chaucer shrugs. \"The knight died protecting the child, and the pirate took her gold, but it's a good story.\" \"Aye.\" Wat nods, jaw clenched. \"Good story.\" 11. Prelude to the Trojan War A golden apple she threw into the banquet, and that apple made her name great. It was the foreign coin, however, in which she truly took pride, placing a kiss on its grinning face before she set out. She met the fair boy on a hillside; another king's misguided attempt to thwart destiny. She gave him the coin, and a kiss, and promised he would be a great man. \"Judge wisely,\" she advised him, snickering within, and he only looked confused. \"What would I judge?\" he asked. \"A contest? A trial?\" \"Be patient,\" she said, with a grin. \"Carry this coin, as a boon to me. Carry it back to your home.\" As she began to fly off to her next mischief, he called out to her. \"Your name, lady?\" \"Eris.\" \"Will I see you again, lady?\" \"You will.\" 12. Harry Potter \"Yes, Hermione?\" \"I'm sorry, Professor Lupin, but I don't understand what you mean by 'heathen gods.' Do you mean other wizards?\" \"The legend only states the coins were cursed by 'the heathen gods.' It's old enough that we can't know for certain.\" \"But--\" \"Unfortunately, some questions can't be answered easily. We do know the coins were, in fact, cursed in some way. People who collected the coins often reported being followed by skeletons or ghosts. Yes, Harry?\" \"Were the skeletons dangerous?\" \"Very. Again, the stories are very old, but they do mention all sorts of unpleasant things happening to them. Yes, Hermione?\" \"Where are the coins now?\" \"That, also, isn't known. The legend mentions an 'Island of Death' that no one can step foot on without being cursed.\" \"The same curse, Professor?\" \"They say the island is haunted by a ghost.\" \"What kind of ghost?\" \"All the legends say he perpetually drinks rum. Maybe he's dangerous, maybe not, but nobody has been able to find the island since the last of the coins disappeared.\" 13. West Wing \"CJ, is the coin authentic?\" \"Authentic gold, Mark, or authentic Aztec?\" She waved his comment back with a grin. \"The coin is real gold, but it isn't actually an Aztec artifact. It's the replica of an heirloom coin said to have been,\" she looked down at her notes, \"cursed by the gods.\" \"Cursed?\" \"According to the legend, the last owner of the coin met with an ill and bloody fate,\" she replied. \"Supposedly pirates were involved.\" \"Is this supposed to send some sort of message to the President?\" \"About being attacked by pirates?\" The reporters laughed, and CJ smiled at the response. \"Trade negotiations are still ongoing, and they're going quite well. The coin is supposed to symbolize a willingness to understand our countries' pasts. Any other questions?\" A rustle of paper, but no questions. \"Thanks, everybody. Have a good evening, and I'll see you tomorrow.\" 14. Xena: Warrior Princess He was known by other names. Aray. Hadak Ura. Chemosh. Ictinike. Wepwawet. Tyr. Bishamon. Ekchuah. Mars. The Aztecs called him Huitzilopochtli. He was good to his followers. Fickle, yes, because he wasn't the friggin' god of being nice, like his half-brother wanted to be, but good just the same. He gave them passion and strength in battle, and protected them if he felt generous. So when those poseurs from Spain infiltrated Aztec lands, killing through deception instead of honest and blessed warfare, he decided to step in. Make a statement. He cursed the gold the Spanish sought, laughing as they ran their hands over it, not noticing the death's head smiling at them. He watched as they, and others, and others again, wandered the earth, undead. When one, unluckily, met the god incarnated, he dared asked why. He paused to savor his answer to the man, skeletal in the moonlight and desperate for respite. \"You don't fuck with Ares, little man.\" He disappeared laughing, and the cursed man wept. 15. Stargate: SG-1 \"There's a skull on the thing, that's all I need to know.\" \"No, Jack, wait!\" Daniel swung his flashlight to illuminate the markings on the cave wall. \"This could be important. These markings are remarkably similar to ancient art found in South America. Incan, maybe, or Aztec...\" His voice trailed off as he ran his hand over the jagged edges of a sun. \"Daniel. Skull.\" Jack pointed at the centerpiece of the wall, an intricate carving of a coin, its skeletal face grinning down at them. It was inlaid in gold, and around it bowed several skeletal figures. \"Need I remind you of the bad luck we've had with skulls?\" Sam's voice rang in from the outside. \"Sir?\" \"Yeah, Carter?\" She rushed into the cave, followed by Teal'c. They both looked unusually flustered. \"Sir, we've found the natives, and they look a little restless.\" Daniel broke off his study. \"Restless, how?\" \"They appear to be strangely skeletal, Daniel Jackson.\" Teal'c gestured in the direction of the gate. \"It might be best if we return another time.\" \"They're armed, sir,\" Carter explained. \"And they look angry.\" As they ran to the gate, pursued by a crowd of angry skeletons, Jack shouted back at Daniel. \"See? What'd I tell you? No more skulls!\"",

    "text": "There must be something, the men's faces seemed to say. They clutched their spears and their swords, their helmets and their shields. They pressed the heels of their hands together to keep their fingers from trembling. They were silent when they were not dying or killing. Faces once familiar to a man were now forgotten somewhat; maybes and might haves. I know you, they thought of saying to the man standing beside them, visibly trembling, their face pale. I think I know you from a place completely unlike this. What they say in its stead is something akin to, This is it. They might not have known each other in life, but they would be together in death just the same. Achilles sat outside of his tent, his back and shoulders hunched, his jaw squared. He looked off into the distance, where opposite forces gathered beyond the blood stained earth. Where fear ripened the dusty air and stained the faces of both foes and allies like ash. There was the prickle of eyes upon him, but he did not look up. Accusing or sympathetic eyes washed over him, and he endured them. He could stand, stretch his arms above his head, and then retreat into his tent. Patroclus would be there. He would raise an eyebrow at Achilles as if to say, \"Have you come to your senses?\" but he would not say such a thing. He had said it enough times. Achilles remembered Patroclus whispering, \"You are foolish.\" The last word was blotted against Achilles' lips, much like the similar chosen words that would follow. Stubborn and childish gave way to wait and ah and oh. \"There. Touch me there.\" The bed creaked underneath their weight as the cool breeze from outside made the opening to their tent flap, wave, and flutter. \"If I am so foolish,\" Achilles had said almost as an afterthought, his fingertips dancing across Patroclus' collarbone. The skin being soft and sun-kissed. \"What does that make you?\" There was a pause. Patroclus' fingers were warm against Achilles' cheek. They touched him until Achilles raised his eyes from the hollow of Patroclus' neck, and met Patroclus' eyes. Such eyes, he thought. Such eyes. Patroclus' smile made the corners of his eyes crease with lines. \"A hero,\" he whispered. The ground beneath Achilles' feet was damp with dew. He watched it, awaiting nothing, just that it remain exactly as it was. Some things, he thought, should not change. Some things, he thought, should forever be as they were. \"The sun rises,\" a gruff voice said from beside Achilles. His hands clasped in his lap, Achilles looked up. His neck cracked and creaked. The sky was more orange than red, and more yellow than orange. \"So it does,\" he muttered. They brought it not long ago. They placed it on the chair in the corner of his tent with a nod that might as well have been nothing. Patroclus did not doubt his decision. He did not doubt his fellow men, his friends, or his brothers. He looked at the suit of armor sitting on the chair in the corner of his tent, and it was not those things that he doubted, but his own abilities. Could he, would he, can he? Achilles had not said a word. Achilles had sat in his chair, his mouth a straight line, the wisps of light hair that escaped its bond flying across his face, obscuring eyes and nose. \"I do not need your approval,\" Patroclus had said, his hands curled at his sides when he wanted nothing more than to reach out, touch a shoulder or an arm or a hip. Just touch; nothing else. Still Achilles said nothing, though when he met Patroclus' gaze, his look read as, \"Oh, but you do.\" The suit's surface had been wiped clean so that it shined. It almost seemed to ripple in the flicker of the candlelight like a pebble in a pond. If he were to touch it, would his fingers disappear into it? He wondered. He didn't dare. He stared at the surface, and his own reflection stared back at him. It was not unlike looking into the stream and seeing your face, your eyes, and the bow of your lips. Little features gathering together to complete a portrait; threads that were woven over one another to create a tapestry. \"We will be giants,\" Achilles had said years ago, when they were but boys. They had taken discarded shields and sandals, breastplates and bracers and dressed themselves to look the part of soldiers. Achilles' slim fingers worked to fasten the buckles at Patroclus' sides. The breastplate was heavy and threatened to weigh Patroclus to the ground. He fought to take deep breaths. Achilles, he noticed, did not have difficulty with the weight of his own armor. Achilles tugged, and Patroclus almost stumbled. \"Giants?\" he laughed, raising his arms above his head to better aid Achilles. \"Why giants?\" Achilles, after a moment of adjustment, fell to his knees in front of Patroclus. His hair fanned across his forehead and into his eyes, and, laughing again, Patroclus reached down to brush it away. \"My dear Patroclus,\" Achilles said. \"Are you afraid of standing tall?\" To which Patroclus had shook his head. To which Patroclus had laughed and shrugged his shoulders -- jingle jangle went the loose buckles dangling from the armor that was not even his. Standing in his tent, Achilles' armor, which Achilles himself had refused to wear, which Patroclus had agreed to don and battle in, placed in front of him, proud and larger than life, Patroclus thought, Yes. Maybe I am. There was a clatter from outside. Wake up, wake up. Battle begins anew. Not having slept at all, Patroclus rubbed a hand across his face. He pinched the bridge of his nose and then ran a hand through his dark hair. When he turned to blow out his candle, he kept his eyes on the armor. Achilles stood from his seat when Patroclus exited the tent. He held his shield not in front of him, but by his side. It was difficult to look one another in the eye because of Patroclus' helmet, and so Achilles found himself looking at the nose guard between Patroclus' eyes. They stood there, and because words failed them both, Achilles ducked his head. The men standing nearby, seeing him, followed suit. Patroclus looked around him, at his fellow men and soldiers giving him a quiet salute of gratitude, and merely nodded. The armor scraped against his skin as he walked past them, his head held high.",

That glade on the slope of Mount Ida, most like; but perhaps it had been drawn earlier. His mother's dreams before his birth, his father's furious judgment -- \"The child must die, or be the death of Troy!\" -- the shepherd carrying him to the mountain for the wolves to rend. The tender-hearted shepherd, not murderer after all but foster-father. That afternoon on Ida, decided Paris. It had rained, and the herd was restless. The sun made golden veils of late-falling raindrops beneath the trees. And down the brambled path from the summit, through the curtain of light, had come a youth and three ladies. A heavy pulse of lust shook and hardened his body, just at the remembered sheen of rain-wet skin as the goddesses shed their robes. The cold wind across the plain felt like a caress. \"Travel with Eros as your guide,\" Aphrodite had advised him. \"Helen, Sparta's queen, is almost as beautiful as I. She will love you as soon as she looks upon you.\" \"But she is Menelaus' wife!\" Paris had said. \"Wife?\" Aphrodite had gestured disdainfully. \"That is nothing to me. He is nothing.\" Paris had learnt to hate her for that gesture. For Menelaus was far from being nothing. It was true, though. Helen had more than mortal loveliness. They said she'd hatched from an egg, her mother a swan-maiden seduced in her winged form by Zeus. It had been a game between them, that first year, for Paris to hunt the soft quills of feathers on Helen's body. Now she lay wakeful in their bed, moonlight bleaching her white throat, while her not-husband walked the walls and gazed towards the beach. Leaving Ida, he had never seen the sea. He remembered coming down from the mountain and seeing a golden country to the west, as the sun set over the water. He had known nothing, then. Had come to Troy like any peasant. His brothers had tried to kill him, but Agelaus his foster-father had cried to Priam, \"Stay them! This is your son!\" \"Put him to death,\" Apollo's priests had urged. \"If he lives, Troy must fall.\" \"This is my lost son!\" Priam had cried, sending away the priests. He had become a prince, falling as easily into it as into the shepherding, into the bull-fights and the judgment and the long days dreaming on the mountain. His brothers eyed him warily: tall Hector, careful always to leave a mark in sword-practice, and silent Deiphobus who looked askance at him, frowning, and would not say why. Priam celebrated him, and Hecuba blinked back tears when she saw him. And then came Menelaus, sailing to offer sacrifice at the tombs of Prometheus' sons. Paris could remember a time when he had thought that Helen's husband would be an old man. Agamemnon's brother, the ruler of Sparta, must surely be a monster, and Paris a hero, rescuing the swan-necked princess. But Menelaus was not old, though there was silver in his dark hair. The lines around his mouth were carved by care, by the judgments and strategies of Sparta's ruler, but that mouth could curve like a bow with laughter. Age had not begun to eat his strength. One night in Troy, both oiled from the bath, Menelaus had pinned him -- both of them laughing -- to the couch beneath the window, slick as a dolphin against his back. Paris had tried to rear up under him, to push Menelaus back and taste him; and Menelaus, still laughing, had simply held him down. Another hot pulse through his veins, there in the cool autumn night. Menelaus was still stronger than him. Paris had faced him in single combat, when the ships first beached below the city walls. He still cherished the scars on his skin, though the ache of those had faded faster than the pain of Menelaus' blank blue gaze through the eye-slits of his helm. \"Helen will love you,\" the goddess had promised. Paris had never thought to ask if he would love her, too; never thought to question love. Heart-whole until that night in Troy, he had never thought to fear Eros. Love was a dalliance, an hour's courting and a minute's bliss, something to fall into and out of like a bed, a nest of leaves, a pretty girl's smile or a companion's strong arms. Eros' arrows had only grazed him, until that night in Troy. The oil had been scented with rosemary. He could smell it now, on the east wind that blew from Mount Ida. There had been sparks in Menelaus' blue gaze, and Paris -- staring unseeing at the campfires across the plain -- wondered if he had seen this future, that night in Troy. He had sacrificed to Aphrodite, seeking guidance. Two fine white kids, and for what? \"Let Eros be your guide, and sail to Sparta\". They did not speak of love, he and Menelaus. Paris remembered the crossing, wracked by more than Poseidon's summer storms. Eros had been the ship's figurehead, gilded arrows aimed at the horizon where Sparta lay. Paris had clung to Menelaus, and pleasure had rocked them both. Menelaus' mouth had traced the lines of Paris' bones, his hands... his hands. \"This is Helen, my wife.\" \"Your servant,\" kneeling, Paris had said, his hands between her cool white palms; not looking at her legendary beauty at all, but holding Menelaus' blue, opaque gaze. Later, he had said, \"She is lovely.\" And when he had reached for Menelaus, his lover had stepped back, drawing his dignity -- the King's dignity -- around him like an invisible shield, a shield to protect him from dark-haired boys who knelt at his feet, whose hyacinthine eyes met his without shame. \"You are as lovely as she,\" he had said, turning away. \"You dazzle me.\" And then the lamp-light had splintered and sparkled in Paris' eyes, hiding Menelaus as he spoke at last of love, and of Helen. He did not name what he felt for Paris. \"But I love --\" Menelaus had turned swiftly on his heel. \"Never say it. To speak of this is to taunt the gods.\" Paris had stood, silent, shocked. \"If you say it, I must send you away.\" \"My heart cannot be silent, even if my tongue is still!\" Menelaus had not answered him, but there had been sorrow in his eyes. Paris had lain sleepless for long hours, that night, and when sleep came at last it brought Aphrodite. \"Helen will love you,\" she had reminded him. \"Menelaus does not!\" But the goddess had leant and stopped his protests with a kiss. In the morning he had woken with Helen in his arms, and a plan hatching like a snake in his heart. \"He said that you were distressed, last night,\" she'd said, mouth very soft and small against his neck. \"And I... I do not...\" \"Come away with me, Helen!\" He did not speak of love, not then. He did not speak, either, of being sent away; of a pain unlike any common wound, that does not fade like the ache of sword-cuts or broken bones. \"I have stolen Menelaus' greatest treasure,\" he had said to Helen, once Sparta had fallen into the sea astern. She had smiled at him wanly, without speaking. \"Why do you weep?\" He had kept his voice gentle, though he'd wanted to rage at her for showing what he could not. \"It's only the wind in my eyes,\" Helen had lied, still smiling, as she turned away. Because of the tears he had seen, Paris had never hoped, then or later, for Menelaus to follow after them; never wished, where any could overhear, that he were the beauty that Menelaus had come to rescue. Still, he thought that Helen understood. She knew what it was to be the gods' game-piece, and she did not reproach him. Fate was the monster that held them both chained. Here in Troy they had come to know one another, as Menelaus -- lured like a fish on a line -- battered all Greece's armies against the walls. Helen's beauty, truly divine, was no mere gilding; her heart was lovely, too. She held Paris as he mourned a lost love, and wept with him, and echoed his grief. No need for them to speak their lost love's name. -end-",

    "text": "Hector, fleeing, had made himself prey; turned the matter from combat to game as he tried to outrun his fate. White dust winged his feet as he ran, striving to outpace Achilles and reach the city gate. Achilles had often run races with Patroclus, before the war. Sometimes -- to see his cousin smile -- he'd let Patroclus win. Swift-footed Achilles, true to the Olympian blood in his veins, was never above guile to gain his prize. His prize then had been Patroclus, laughing at him from the course's end, half-knowing that his victory was Achilles' gift. Later, after their pulses and their breathing had raced together in a gentler contest, they'd lain in one another's arms, limbs heavy with fatigue. \"I will avenge you, when you're dead,\" he'd said to Achilles once. \"You think even Death can part us?\" Achilles had murmured, pretending surprise. \"Surely I will find my way back to your arms.\" \"And leave me waiting for you?\" Patroclus had said, laughing. \"No! I'll come to Hades, and bring you out with me.\" He'd sealed the vow with a kiss. Achilles had kissed him back, and let the kiss seal his lips. That was not the fame he had been promised. Now he chased Hector in the shadow of Troy's walls, breath even and feet unfaltering. He knew the weight -- who knew it better? -- of the armour that Hector wore, knew how much it would slow the other man. The breast-plate would have been warm, still, when Hector stripped it from Patroclus' body. Achilles' own armour was light and strong and bright with newness, the gift of his goddess-mother. Patroclus' death did not weigh him down; it lent him strength. He ran as though he were running towards Patroclus, and not his killer. He'd send Hector hurrying down to Hades with tidings for the slain: \"Achilles, your cousin, salutes you. He sends you this sacrifice, avenging you.\" He would seal it... Another turn, and the sun cast sharp rays into Achilles' eyes. Apollo's tricks had helped slay Patroclus, but they would not stay his avenger. Hector was slowing, so near that Achilles could hear his breath rasping in his lungs. He did not need to see his quarry. \"Hector!\" he cried, and heard the other stumble, as though the dust concealed snares. \"Hector! Stand and fight!\" And Hector turned, his sword catching the red light of the sinking sun. Half-blinded by Apollo's rays, hand rising to shield himself against phantoms that Hector's sandalled foot kicked up from the dust, Achilles brought his own sword up. He thought of Patroclus, who had died without any god to protect him. Achilles' own armour had not been enough. Achilles had no need of divine help now. Hector's blood felt cold where it splashed against Achilles' unarmoured skin. Achilles' sword had pierced his breast, and the death-spasms were strong and quick. \"Let... my people... have my body,\" Hector pleaded, between the screams that he would not voice. \"No,\" said Achilles, leaning forward. \"But I will send you, prince, as my messenger to Hades.\" Hector's mouth was bitter with bile, salty with blood. His lips were already as cold as a corpse's. He struggled, pinned by Achilles' strong hands, pierced by his sword. Achilles, strong and alive, kissed Hector with all the impotent fire that still burnt in him for lost Patroclus. He breathed in the ragged breaths as Hector fought for air. Faintly, from the city walls, came the Trojans' cries. Hector's body slackened in his grasp, and Achilles, unhurried, drew back from the kiss. He let Hector -- no, Hector's corpse -- fall at his feet. \"Tell him...\" he said aloud, into the roaring silence. But the kiss, and its bearer, were message enough. Achilles' chariot was approaching from the Greek camp already, the horses' legs socked with white dust. Kneeling, he began to strip his armour from Hector's still-warm body. -end-",

    "text": "\"Come to my bed,\" he urged his cousin. \"Come and lie down with me.\" \"When I lie next to you, your dreams slaughter sleep,\" Patroclus grumbled. \"You fight strange armies in the night!\" But he let himself be led, let Achilles tie the three knots at the tent-flap to lock out the Myrmidons, lock out the High King Agamemnon, lock out sweet Briseis with her tears. Tonight the two of them would be alone again. \"Now I shall be master!\" Patroclus proclaimed, laughing, and let Achilles kneel before him, unbuckling the heavy greaves with careful hands. \"Don't mark the metal,\" said Patroclus, looking down; Achilles looked up, into his dark eyes, and for a moment time turned away from them, letting Patroclus fall, letting Achilles fall, each into the other... Achilles is kneeling before the pyre, face flushed already though the wood was not yet alight. The last of the sunlight flashes on the knife in his hand. Stiff as an old man, he cuts locks of his blazing hair for the fire to consume. So that Patroclus will not forget. But Patroclus' fingers were knotted in his hair, and his face was pressed against his cousin's groin, inhaling a heavy musk that aroused him as easily and thoughtlessly as a stallion scenting a mare. Memory and desire took over. Achilles stroked, sucked, tasted, distracted by Patroclus' sheer presence, the life in him, coming out of him as hot as blood as Patroclus bit his own hand, that none might hear him cry aloud. Then to the bed, where Achilles stood and let Patroclus lay aside each weapon, armour, garment, like the squire he had been at first. Once he was naked he stood, pressing against his lover, whispering to him. \"Let me take you, conquer you... Give yourself up to me...\" Patroclus stretched out on the dirty, striped woollen blanket. His skin was dark at arms, legs, neck; paler on his back; pale as Briseis' across his buttocks, and in the soft places under the socket of his arms. Achilles knelt over him, hands tracing the saw-edge of the spine. He gasps as the cold skin twitches beneath his fingertips. He thinks that Patroclus is still alive, after all, after the havoc Hector's spear has wrought. Then he thinks that Patroclus had better be dead. The flesh under his hands is hard and cold, and his skin catches on the dead skin, which has a purple cast as though Patroclus has drunk poison. When the muscle spasms again, Achilles does not notice. He kneels in silence with his hands quiet on the dead man's ruined flesh, remembering his memory of this moment: remembering the waking dream that brought him here back when... For a moment there's a loop, flickering through present and future, from prescience to truth, from vision to sight: a loop where present leads from future as surely as future from past. The loop's of fine work like a bridal garland, and -- like a bridal garland -- a single blow might break it. Next moment, Achilles' face was buried in Patroclus' neck; he could feel the sweat-damp locks against his forehead, like balm, \"Achilles?\" He made a wordless noise, like a child waking in the night. His hands tightened on his cousin's shoulders. There were tears on his cheeks. \"Nothing,\" he said at last. \"It's nothing.\" And set himself to make Patroclus alive, immortal, incandescent; to make him cry aloud with ecstasy, and never think of who might hear. Later, Achilles lay and listened to his cousin's steady breath. In sleep, his dreams were waiting. He fought them back again. -end-",

    "text": "The white dust of Troy found its way everywhere. It dulled the gleam of armour, clogged a man's nostrils, blurred his vision. But it was not dust that gleamed amid the red of Patroclus' wound. Achilles turned away, left the tent. He did not listen to the muttering that mocked him for being afraid to see blood. Blood was not the problem. He still remembered the first time he had seen what lay beneath his own skin. He'd stared, fascinated, at the nauseating white that showed at the bottom of a deep, ugly gash just above his knee. At first he hadn't realised that he was looking at bone. \"This is the long bone in your thigh,\" Chiron had lectured. \"See, there: the sword-stroke chipped the bone.\" \"Will I... will I die?\" Achilles, still a boy, had asked. Chiron had laughed indulgently. \"No wound can slay you, for your mother made you invulnerable.\" Achilles had a brief, bright vision of flames. He shook his head to clear it, and his tutor's hand faltered as he plucked a sliver of white bone from the mess of blood and tissue. \"Be still. This is delicate work... This wound will not kill you, but you will carry the mark as long as you live.\" Chiron took a sponge and cleaned away the blood again. His breath was warm and smelt of herbs. \"And when you die if you should die this bone will bear the mark.\" That night, Achilles had dreamt for the first time of his own white bones, mocking him with their undeserved immortality when through some mischance, some divine displeasure he lay dead after all. He'd dreamt that dream again, when deep wounds showed him what lay beneath his flesh: once, when he'd broken his arm riding, and could not hold a sword in his right hand. The white bone, invisible that time under its decent coat of flesh and blood, mocked him: I will tell of this, it seemed to say, when you are gone. The white dust on the plain before Troy made him think of bone-dust. So many had died here... but they had burnt the corpses, and all that remained was white ash. So many fallen, and all for one golden-haired, white-skinned bitch and her inconvenient lover. Achilles snarled noiselessly, and a boy scrambled to his feet from beside a smoky camp-fire. \"My lord?\" \"Go,\" Achilles told the boy, \"and bring me word of Patroclus, when they have finished tending him.\" He did not think his lover's wound was lethal. The cut was deep bone glimmering beneath the blood but clean, and otherwise he was unmarked. The Trojan who had wielded the sword was dead, of course: another would have seen to that if Patroclus had not kept his feet for long enough to kill him. \"It should have been me at his back,\" Achilles murmured. He had reached his tent: Briseis looked at his expression, and bowed her head. He was fond of her: but now she reminded him of a corpse, all pale skin and pale eyes. \"Is my armour clean?\" he asked, seeing the filthy polishing-rag in her hand. \"Yes, my lord.\" Her hands were reddened with the work of keeping the bronze shining bright. He loved the reddish glint: it spoke to him of life. Sometimes, before a battle, when the world seemed bleached by imminence white sky above, sun veiled in heat-haze, and the dust, the damned white dust, everywhere, choking him this armour would be the only colour he could see. Then, as he shed enemy blood, red and bright and lively, onto the plain, Achilles would find his way back into the living world. All the air in the tent had fled. Achilles sat on the ground outside, leaving Briseis to finish her polishing. He stared into the distance, out through the shimmer to the city, waiting for word of Patroclus. Eventually the boy came back. \"He lives!\" Achilles said nothing, and the boy's exultant smile wavered. \"He is awake, and he asks you to come,\" he said, less certain. \"I will,\" said Achilles, and favoured the youth with his quick, bright smile. Patroclus was leaning on pillows when Achilles returned to his tent. The skin under his eyes was grey, and there was a grim twist to his smile, but he greeted Achilles as though his absence was expected. Achilles stretched out beside his lover, running a hand gently over dark-tanned skin, feeling the curve and tension of hard muscle beneath. So unlike a woman's pale, pale body. \"I live, as you see,\" Patroclus said to him, and his smile was as indulgent as Chiron's, so long ago. \"How is the wound?\" Patroclus' arm was bound up with dark blue cloth: it had been, Achilles thought, one of his own tunics. \"It aches,\" admitted Patroclus. \"Then let me distract you from the ache,\" said Achilles, low-voiced. They were alone in the tent, and none would enter unannounced while the two of them were here together. Achilles leant forward, dropping a kiss on his lover's throat. At first he tasted dust, but he sucked harder Patroclus moaned and tasted flesh, salt, the echo of blood under the skin. \"You live?\" he said, lifting his head to examine the wine-dark bruise where his mouth had been. It seemed a good proof to him. \"That's good.\" \"I think so,\" said Patroclus, grinning now. \"For you would not love a corpse.\" Into Achilles' mind there came a single flash of bloodless flesh and unresisting limbs, and wounds that no longer bled. Cold mouth, cold heart, and white bone beneath it all, waiting. \"I could not love a corpse,\" he said, and lowered his head to taste Patroclus' living mouth. -end-",

Achilles, greatest of the Greeks, is walking up the beach away from the sea. Reaching the edge of the scrubland, he steps into the brackish water of a small, shallow river and wades upstream against the current. Clear water splashes over his salt-speckled shins. After a while, behind him, he hears the corresponding splashes of another man's steps. The stream runs through a head-high thicket, already buzzing with crickets. Achilles smells sage, the sea, and woodsmoke from the camp: but here on the riverbank, he can see no further than the dense growth that surrounds him. He stands in the cool flowing water and waits. \"Am I your dog, to follow you thus at a look?\" Patroclus is grinning, and his expression plucks the sting from his words. Achilles raises a single red-gold brow and looks his friend up and down, lingeringly. Patroclus' tunic is patched, his leather jerkin stiff with blood and dirt. Still, he is whole of limb and mind: they both are, though so many of both armies have fallen or are falling to the siege. \"I judge a man by his actions,\" Achilles says at last. \"Or a dog?\" \"Or a dog,\" Achilles agrees Then they are both laughing, arms around one another. It's a fine thing to fight shoulder to shoulder, to huddle next to each other at the camp fire when night comes down, to stand close when the sacrifice is made and the burnt bones and sizzling fat send up messages to the gods. But this, this... this intimacy has no place in war. They must make room for it. Now Achilles draws Patroclus down to sit -- for now -- beside him, on the bank of this small stream. Their weight crushes the thyme and clover, sending up a sharp scent. Achilles is gentle this morning, and the kiss is like a greeting. Kissing is their shame: more intimate than one man taking another, an act that can be heard twenty times a night within the camp. Warriors must seek relief, and there is a comfort in that act, though none speak of it. But Achilles and Patrocluslove, and that is not a warrior's choice. When they were boys together, love was allowed. They would grow out of it. Every year there were new weapons, new armour, new tunics and sandals. The year he was fourteen, Achilles had been given a new longbow, as tall as himself. His cousin Patroclus, the taller of the two, had drawn the bow more easily. \"You're too weak yet,\" he had teased. \"Like a girl.\" \"Like a girl, is it?\" Always, before, Achilles would have knocked him over for an insult like that, rolling on the floor like a pair of hounds until Patroclus -- almost always Patroclus, for all his height and weight -- begged laughingly for peace. That time, Achilles just looked askance at his cousin. \"Like a girl,\" he said again, scowling. \"We shall see.\" Patroclus was uneasy: worse, he didn't know how to make amends to this new, cold Achilles. He handed back the longbow and watched as Achilles set himself to master it. Even so young, his concentration was terrifying. He studied, fought, trained with that same single-minded intensity, as though everything was a challenge that he must win. Now he turned that same expression upon his cousin, and Patroclus was almost afraid of him. The day sped on, Apollo's chariot hurtled towards the west, the sky darkened and ghosts walked among the cypress trees on the mountain. Achilles had disappeared, and Patroclus gathered up his cousin's armour from the corner of the training ground. Achilles was still growing fast: the armour was almost of a size with his own. Soon they'd be able to share one another's arms, as warriors did. The armour clattered to the ground in the grove between the training ground and the house, where something heavy and fast-moving cannoned into Patroclus and knocked him to the ground. Faintly, under the sound of beaten metal impacting with trees and earth, he heard the hiss of his cousin's breathing. \"Achilles...\" \"Like a girl, am I?\" Achilles demanded, voice low and furious in his ear. \"We'll see who is like a girl. Who takes it like one.\" Before that, it had been half a joke: passionate kisses bestowed with outrageous simpering, shared hilarity at the sheerfun of discovering how different it felt when the hand was someone else's. Now Achilles' whole body wound itself around Patroclus like a snake, like an octopus, and his mouth was hot and sharp against Patroclus' skin. Patroclus was fighting back before he started to think about it: after that, he had to pretend to fight still, because a sudden surrender would have been too honest for either of them. He let himself give in gradually, gloriously, instead, let Achilles conquer him. \"Like a girl,\" Achilles murmured afterwards, and Patroclus chuckled and stretched and said, \"it's true, what they say about women getting the best of it.\" Which was, it turned out, enough of a challenge to give him Achilles' surrender too. Neither of them will ever surrender to anyone else. Once Patroclus -- in Achilles' armour, a perfect fit at last -- has fallen to Hector's hand, Achilles will have to find other ways to love. The blood will ooze like sap from the slits in Hector's ankles when he slits them. Hector will be dead already: it won't be him who Achilles intends to wound by this act. Maybe wounding will not enter his mind at all. Maybe as he threads his belt, bloodily, through the sinews of the prince's ankles, as he secures the looped leather to the back of the chariot, he'll be thinking of fastening the belt around Patroclus' waist, dressing him after a stolen hour in the early morning. Three times around the walls, and Achilles will not be seeing the Trojans thronging the walls. He will be seeing Patroclus, gloriously bright, vanquishing Hector with the blow that missed. He will be celebrating with Patroclus as the smoke of Hector's pyre rises in the still air above the city. He will deck Patroclus in gold chains and precious stones from Priam's treasure-hoard for the simple pleasure of stripping each item from Patroclus again. He will have forgotten that the treasure is payment for Hector's abused corpse. He will forget everything except Patroclus. He will remember taking Patroclus like a girl, that first time beneath the cypress trees, when he is raping the corpse of the Amazon queen. He'll cut locks of his hair and cast them upon Patroclus' bier, and he will forget -- staring at the corpse -- that Patroclus is dead. The moment he lives in will be one when Patroclus is with him, close by, solid and strong and warm. Ready to fight, or sleep, or watch the smoke of sacrifice rise up. Achilles will ignore the whimpering shade that, like a dog, follows him to his death. -end-",

    "text": "Anticipation is a lovely word. Anticipation is defined like so: an-\"ti-s&-'pA-sh&n Function: noun 1 a: a prior action that takes into account or forestalls a later action b: the act of looking forward; especially: pleasurable expectation 2: the use of money before it is available 3 a: visualization of a future event or state b: an object or form that anticipates a later type 4: the early sounding of one or more tones of a succeeding chord to form a temporary dissonance -- compare SUSPENSION synonym see PROSPECT. Say it. Anticipation. In the right mouth, the word hangs on the lips. Rolls around the tongue. Caresses the lips that says the word. Suspension, expectation, desire. Orpheus had anticipation for his wedding and for his bride Euridice. Now there is a word. Euridice. She of the black ringlet hair and flashing eyes. In Orpheus' mouth, her name was a paean, an ode, an epiphany of joy. But then Orpheus was a singer, a poet, a tenor with a very broad range. Some say that he was the son of Apollo, god of music, among other things. Others say that he was the son of Calliope, Muse of Epic Poetry. Others name him the son of Morpheus, god of dreams. But these are all lies. In that, as the philosophers will tell you, all stories are lies. They would say there is only truth in fact and measurement. In the distance from the wrist to the elbow. In the speed that a rock falls to earth. In the way that the sun is just a burning flame in the heavens. Anyway, there are just as many philosophers who say that truth and reality are subjective. For the purposes of this story, this truth or lie, let us say that Orpheus was the son of a mortal man and a mortal woman. People who toiled in the earth and in their time died. In turn, let us say that Orpheus was like a nightingale among the pigeons. That throughout his childhood, Orpheus eagerly anticipated the day that he might be free to fly. Yet a dissonance on this dream was the thought that he would have to leave the fair, the lovely Euridice. Euridice whose name lay like honey upon Orpheus' tongue. Euridice of the deep bosom and trim ankles. No nightingale she to fly away with Orpheus, but no pigeon either. To extend the metaphor to its farthest reach, let us call her a dove. Orpheus certainly called her a dove and goddess and much more as he wrote songs and poems, paeans and odes to the wonder that was the girl next door. And yet, Orpheus needed the story of the road. The quick adventure of this and that. Anticipation, adventure, release. So, as soon as he could, he did. It was as much his nature as his voice was tenor sweet. When Orpheus left, the two lovers tremblingly clasped hands and lips. Swore on their honor that their love was eternal. That Orpheus would return to Euridice of the curling black hair. That Euridice would remain true to Orpheus whose music could make the Muses weep. Parting seemed a torment to the young lovers and yet young love loves to feed on torment. Orpheus set out on his road to the world and wrote sweet songs of his beloved, of their love, and of his sorrow. Euridice in her turn put off her white clothes and wore black, which was quite becoming to one with such thick curling black hair, such pallor of skin, such flashing brown eyes. And so the dove became a raven and in so doing found that she liked being the black and moody one. True, an odd delight, but really not uncommon. She took to wandering the local graveyards and painting pictures of cypress trees while she thought of Orpheus far away. Orpheus went into the world and had many adventures. He teased the Muses in their revels. He soothed dragons in their labors. He even accompanied Jason upon the Argo on the fateful quest for the golden fleece. And when they came to where the sirens sang upon the shore, the sirens paid tribute to Orpheus' voice be ceasing to sing, by swimming playfully along side the boat. But these are all stories for other days. Now when Orpheus had traveled for a time, it came to him that his feet were weary, and that he was tired of singing love songs for his distant beautiful Euridice. So, he began the long journey home. Each step a little lighter, filled as it was with the expectation of seeing his love. Around the familiar bend he came. Singing with joy, playing upon his lyre made from a tortoise shell. The rocks and trees swayed to the happy tune. Joyful expectation was met by joy as he saw her in a field. Dressed in her black, her face carefully shaded to preserve the pallor of her sorrow. This was not quite how Euridice had imagined Orpheus' return. Somehow it had always involved a pale and sorrowing Orpheus returning to find that poor faithful Euridice had pined away from loneliness. That on seeing her grave, he would fall to the earth weeping and in so doing die of a broken heart. Or that she would get some illness whose grip would leave even her paler yet and that as she lay dying, Orpheus would return. And that she would say this or that poignant thing and then die. Or perhaps his sweet singing would bring her back to life. Or still further, she had imagined that Orpheus himself would return, injured or sick. and that by her careful nursing, she would bring him back to life. And as a repentant and broken man, he would swear to always remain at her side and wander again no more. She had not imagined that would she be plucking weeds in a field when he returned. She had not imagined him singing with joy. She threw down her trowel. Gathered up her long flowing black robes, which were a little too long to run in and flung herself at him. For a little time at least, there was no singing. And so we come to anticipation, expectation, and desire. They quickly planned a wedding feast. Oh, the torments they suffered, a whole week's wait to their wedding day. Although, it should be mentioned that they did in fact anticipate their wedding night on the very night that Orpheus returned. But that is as young love should be, a joy that cannot be delayed. Then the day came. Orpheus, with his wine dark voice, and Euridice, with her face perfect oval pale and ivory smooth, plighted their troth in the temple to Hera. After the wedding, there was food and wine, music and dancing long into the night. And as soon as they could, which was very soon, the young lovers crept off to plight their troth in other ways. Here we leave them for a bit in the soft rich night with the moon shining down. For such are private things and do not concern us. In the morning, Euridice woke and stretched. A haystack is only romantic by moon light and by morning it is an uncomfortable place to have slept. But she was young and Orpheus was young and they had all the time in the world before them. Orpheus had returned and she was done with waiting in the graveyard although possibly not black. For as has been said, it was a color that suited her and it was in her nature to be a raven. These were her thoughts as she climbed down off the hay, tugging at Orpheus, who was not quite ready to get up. The thoughts of the little green snake at the foot of the hay stack were likewise simple. It wanted a rat to eat and for the day to begin. Now when a girl meets a snake, several things can happen. In this case, she screamed and startled the little snake. And so frightened, it struck. Biting her on one of her trim ankles. Frightened she fell and knew in an instance that she was dying. How odd. That this was all the time in the world that she was to have. No poetic last words, just sleep. And Orpheus wept as Euridice had imagined he would. He lay across her weeping. And because he was a singer, he sang his tears and the sky opened up in sympathy. For in those days, the world and singers were on speaking terms. He thought to kill himself with a knife, with poison, with something. But it was not in his character any more than he could have sung a note off key. He considered potions and magic. But as the brown villagers told him, dead is dead and that all there was to be done was to bury her. However, Orpheus was a poet and a dreamer. An adventurer who deeds were light quick. In a moment he decided. He would go to the realm of the dead and win the Euridice back to life. He gathered some food from the wedding feast and set off. After Orpheus left, Euridice's parents buried their little raven in a quiet tomb with words and incense. Orpheus traveled for many months in the direction that a door to the afterlife was said to lie. In truth, it was a very boring journey. He sang for his supper and slept in fields. He met no fierce creatures. Had no wild adventures. And since more interesting things lie ahead, we shall gloss over this part. At the end of his journey, he came to a great black cave in scraggly brown scrub. Through this cave lay the world of the dead. The cave exhaled cold dank air into the late summer afternoon. Orpheus did not stop. Did not hesitate. He strode into the cave. And quickly strode out again so that he could light his torch. When he was ready, he set out down the long narrow way. After a time and a half, the cave opened up on a great vast cavern. It was somewhat brighter here. There was a strange glowing mist, full of voices and sighs. After a few steps, Orpheus came to a river. Well, actually, he tripped and fell head first in it. It was bone cold. He scrambled back to the shore. He looked around. To his left, he could dimly see a small dock, with a little boat and a little man. He walked briskly towards it. The man was old and bent. He had a long white beard, which is not all that unusual, and burning yellow eyes, which is. Orpheus walked up to the old man without a pause and asked if this was the way to the underworld? If this was the great wide river Styx. If the old man was the ferryman.The old man chewed on a bit of straw and allowed that yes this was the way to the underworld, although why a living man should care, he didn't know. That this was the river Styx, although whether it was great or not he couldn't say. And that yes he was the ferryman, although most people called him Charon, or old man, or you there. Orpheus was excited, the real adventure could now begin. He told Charron who he was and how he had journeyed the wild world over. How he had loved the lovely Euridice, her name which rolled like blossoms off Orpheus' tongue. How they had been reunited after a long separation. How on the morning after their wedding, she had died. How he had come to the realm of the dead to seek her out and win her back to the warm world above. Charron allowed that this was a very pretty story and very well told. Not like some poets these days who liked to tell stories that made no sense or in which everyone was ugly or philosophers ride around in balloons. No, an excellent story all around. But as he chewed on his bit of straw, he didn't quite see what it had to do with him. And anyway, there were a number of things Charron didn't quite understand. If Orpheus had loved Euridice so much, why did he wait so long to marry her? Well, why did he have to go wander the world? Couldn't he have played music at home in his village? Well, why didn't Euridice go with him? Well, if you want one thing out of life and she wants another, then are you sure that you were meant to be together? Well, obviously a village wasn't all that safe now was it? And, what did a young man with a beautiful young woman want with danger? Why was he looking for Euridice now? Why couldn't he just wait to see her when he died? If he loved Euridice so much, why did he wait so long to marry her? And around and around and around. Orpheus got a little agitated here. He explained in quick sharp words how he needed to cross the river. No good, Charron just chewed on his bit of straw. Orpheus was ready to despair, which only made Charron tell him to buck up and here, have an onion. That it would make a man of him. Orpheus did not want an onion. He wanted to cross the river. To be with his one true love. He thought of her black hair, her flashing eyes and he was filled with anticipation, with desire, with despair that he would never cross the damned River Styx. Charron told Orpheus not to get so glum so fast and anyway Orpheus should make himself useful and play an old man a jig. So, Orpheus did and Charron listened. The sand of the shore began to jump with the rhythm. Charron allowed that Orpheus wasn't a half bad musician, but he still wasn't going to take Orpheus across the river. And today, he had things to do, important things. That Orpheus was just going to have to wait. Now as you may have gathered, Orpheus wasn't good at waiting. But there wasn't much else that he could do. The river was too wide and cold and weird. So, he ate his food and played jigs and cheery songs to lighten the wait in that cheerless place. The days past: one, two, three, seven, nine. And then one day Charron said, as if he had never told Orpheus to wait, that he should get in the boat already. That they didn't have all day. They set out into the mist in Charron's little craft. Charron pushing the boat with his long pole. Orpheus playing sea songs on his lyre. The sound of Orpheus' songs echoed on the still water. Hung in the wet white mist. When they reached the far shore, Charron gave Orpheus directions. To the Elysian Fields, which were quite nice this time of year. To Tartarus, although he doubted he'd need to go there what with Orpheus' lady being so nice and all. To the House of Hades, because Lord Hades really would need to approve any dead people picking up and leaving and all that. Orpheus shivered when Charron said the name of the Lord of Many. It was bad luck to say the name of the Lord of the Shady Realms, which is why he has so many names. On the other hand, Orpheus was alive and walking through the underworld, which some might say was bad luck. Orpheus set off away from the river. He walked across vast howling plains filled with asphodel which blooms white and strange. He walked through a dense forested thicket with black and gnarled branches. The leafless trees groaned and shrieked in the still air. Strange birds with maidens faces, covered in the foulest filth, crouched in the trees and rent the black branches with sharp claws. He played a soft romantic melody on his lyre, shiny with use, and they crooned to themselves and did not bother him. He came to a small black bridge over an icy river. Quiet shades waited on either shore of the river. Translucent pale, like white shadows. They shifted and moved along the river banks. Murmuring to each other. To the river. And the river would answer in cracks and groans and trickles. White mist rose from the river into the air. As Orpheus stood on the lacquered black bridge, curved like an upside down smile, one of the shades stepped into the river. It, for Orpheus could not tell if it had been man or woman, ducked into and under the black water. It emerged dripping with ice. And then with a sigh, the edges of the shade blurred and spread. The white shade dissipated into the mist around it. Orpheus shivered in the cold air and walked on. He walked through groves of golden trees with round shimmering leaves like coins. The air was sharp and crisp and crackled. Leaves red and gold and brown drifted into the yellow grass and crunched beneath his feet. Shades wandered through the trees. They were more solid than the shades of the winter thicket. They had faces and features and gender. However, they walked in sighing contemplation of the drifting leaves and did not answer when Orpheus asked them if they knew of Euridice. He walked on. The trees grew green the farther that he walked. The grass grew lush under his feet. The air warm and glowing, effulgent. Which was odd, since there was no sun, and yet everything had a golden glow. There was the sound of distant chimes. He walked on. The meadows between the trees became flocked with flowers and busy scarlet butterflies. A playful breeze struck a copse of flowering trees and Orpheus was surrounded in a sudden drift of white and pink flowers. The air was sweet with visions of what might be. Surely he would find Euridice here. Orpheus walked purposefully along the wooded paths. Singing as he walked. Shades playing hide and seek among the ferns, rose up to greet him. But they did not know Euridice of the black ringlets and flashing eyes. Orpheus continued to sing. It was a vast wood and full of spirits. His song drew shades that skipped like butterflies and danced like children in the grass. But no one knew anything of Euridice of the deep bosom and trim ankles. He walked on and on. And then there was an end to the wood. He walked through misty fields where spirits tilled the earth as they had when they lived under the sun. Orpheus thought he saw his parents, but since he had had nothing to say to them when they were alive, he walked on. Orpheus came to a great iron wall, red with rust. He walked along the edge until he came to a gate that lay open, broken at the hinges. There were four women standing at the gate. Although they looked nothing alike, they were somehow all the same. Four sisters with pale blue white eyes and wild icorous red hair. They wore red and black and blood. They each held a black scorpion flail. The Erinies, who torment the wicked. They seemed to move oddly to Orpheus' eye. It was as if he could not quite perceive their motion. One moment they were standing at the gate and then, as if he had blinked his eyes, (although he had not) they surrounded him.The crone commented that he was a pretty chicken and pinched his arm. Stung him with her long, long nails. The warrior cinched tight in leather black ran her hand across his shoulders and asked him if he had come to play. The mother, who one moment seemed to be knitting, and then in the next had only a poisonous black flail, commented that he was a little lamb and that he would make good wool. The maiden in her stained dress asked him if he had been bad. And they all laughed together that everyone is bad. Orpheus addressed them as politely as he could. Gracious Kindly Ones. Alecto, whose anger is unceasing. Tisiphone, avenger of murder. Nemesis, unceasing retribution. Megaera, jealous of the world. He tried to sing to them. Nemesis flashed and disappeared to his right. Megaera shifted in and out on his left. Alecto and Tisiphone circled around the edges of his eyes. They quieted him with fingers and hands and scorpion tips. Shhhh, for that was not the kind of music that they liked. He pleaded for assistance in finding Euridice who had been killed so young. So, unfairly. Megaera kissed the green hydra that suddenly appeared wrapped around her bent shoulders and smiled an old woman's mad smile. Leather clad Tisiphone flashed in front of him and cracked the air next to Orpheus cheek with her whip. Then just as sudden, she leaned over his shoulder and whispered in a voice of scratched dark delights that Euridice's death wasn't what she'd call killing. He pleaded to Nemesis's mother love, for she had been the mother of the fair Helen and dark Clytemnestra. Nemesis replied with a mother's plump calm that she had driven her own grandson mad and she smiled a smile that was all quiet and reason and menace. He begged Alecto, youngest of the sisters born of patricide and blood soaked dirt, for entry into Tartarus. She looked up at him from her red game in the red dirt and declared that she was bored now. That she wanted to play. Nemesis shushed her and told Orpheus that of course he could go look in Tartarus and even come out again. But if he tried to take any of their little duckling, then they'd have to flay him stem to stern. Little Alecto jumped up from the dirt and gripped Orpheus hand, dragged him through the rusting iron gate. She dragged him past Sisyphus and his rolling rock and Tartatarus standing in his lake. Past people that he knew. Past people that he didn't. People on fire and people encased in ice. Through shrieks and moans, which sweet faced Alecto called singing and pretty, very, very pretty. However, Orpheus did not see Euridice. Alecto dragged him back out the gate and she let go of his hand. They laughed and crackled at him as he walked as fast away as his feet could walk. By the time he could feel his hand again, Alecto had had quite a grip, he could see a great dark shape in the distance. As he grew closer, he could see that it was great building of spires and sharp pointed gates and walls. Orpheus grew closer and he could see that the walls were covered with spikes and spines. Carrion birds sat upon the spires and the air was filled with the sound of raucous calls. As Orpheus approached the nearest gate. A great black thing ran round the city. It was the size of a black bull. It barked and snarled from three dog's red mouths full of yellow teeth. Its coat was tangled and wild. All six eyes were red and burned with white flame. Its feet were the size of serving plates and its tail was serpent black and covered in scales. Orpheus did not hesitate. He began a simple melody on his tortoise green lyre. Quiet and low. Soft and calming. The great beast ceased to bark. Orpheus walked closer. He began to sing a lullaby. The creature circled on itself three times and sat down. Its red eyes blinked at Orpheus. Once, twice, closed. The thing began to sleep. Orpheus could smell the stench of its fowl breath as he edged by it and up to the gate. He knocked softly, so as not to wake the beast. A little window opened in the wall and a little white head stuck out. Name. It asked. Orpheus explained that he was looking for his true love Euridice. Name? It asked again. Orpheus told the head his name. The head ducked in the window and there was a sound of scratching. The head reappeared. Occupation? It asked. Orpheus replied that he was a poet. The head didn't seem to think very well of this answer. There was more scratching. When Orpheus had answered a great many questions about his age, and favorite color, and demographic, and why he was there, and where he saw himself in five years...the mighty black gate creaked open. Orpheus glanced at the beast. It continued to sleep. Orpheus was let into a great courtyard lined with black and blue stones. A little white man, attached to the question asking head, led him into the house of the Lord of Tartarus. He was assigned a room. Told not to wander from it. Orpheus had no intention of doing so. He tried to ask if he could see the Lord Clymenus which means the Illustrious. Orpheus could not bring himself to name Hades by his proper name, for it was bad luck. The little man cut him off. He was told to freshen for dinner. Although, if he was mortal, he really ought not to eat anything. This was unfortunate. Orpheus had run out of food. Orpheus sat on the edge of the black bed in the room furnished in teak with adamantine floors and walls. He played a simple melody and waited in hope. In a few hours, the little man reappeared and brought him down through winding stairs and twisting halls to a great room. The ceiling was so high that it disappeared into the black. The walls were of black stone and decorated with hangings of spring fields and meadows and wood nymphs and children. They looked new. In fact, at one end of the room, Orpheus could see servants hanging tapestries and colorful draperies of green and gold. In the center of the room was a great stone table, black and carved with scenes of judgement and death. It was piled high with fresh cut flowers. There was food hidden between the flowers and the scent was over poweringly sweet. Orpheus tried not to sneeze. The room was filled with people in all manner of dress. Old and young. There were men and women. Humans, black and white. Satyrs drinking their wine. Fauns playing skipping games. Sirens practicing their singing. One of them waved at Orpheus. He waved back. The noise was deafening. Orpheus felt dizzy and very, very hungry. He looked around at all of the crowding people. No one was watching. He had bit of bread and felt instantly better. He looked to see if he could find the Lord Chthonios zeus. But no one looked godlike. Or those that did, did not like they were gods of a place like this. He approached one of the sirens and asked if they knew where the King and Queen of the dead were or when they would be coming. The siren giggled in her feathers and said that they would not be seeing them tonight. Maybe tomorrow. If they were lucky. That it had been a really long hot summer and fall. And then she fell to giggling with her sisters. Orpheus could not get them to make any more sensible remarks and went back to surreptitiously grazing from the table. That night he tried to sleep in the black bed, beneath black sheets, but he couldn't. He was full of expectation. Practicing the things that he would say and do when he saw the Lord Pluton, Pluto, Lord of the Dead, Judge, Lord Arbiter. His mind shied away from the name Hades. Better not to even think it. Better not jinx his chances. The next day, he waited and thought. He was not good at waiting. He was a doer. So he practiced his many songs. If he had looked, he would have seen a small crowd gathered under his window. People dancing to the music. But he didn't look, so he never knew. That night he went to another banquet. The same vast room. The same great table. The black walls with the same hangings and bright cloth. There were fresh flowers on the table. Orpheus had an odd sense that the house was happy. But he decided it was just the smell of the flowers getting to him. He nibbled on some more bread and cheese and chatted with mythic and mortal things. The next day was the pattern of the first and the next. Orpheus would wait and practice. People would gather and dance. Orpheus went to the banquet. The crowds would gather and talk. But the Lord and Lady of the place never appeared. On the fourth day, the little man came to Orphesus' room. He told him that the Lord Hades was seeing petitions today. And because his lady was in a mood for music and poetry, his name had been moved to the end of today's list. And then the little man led Orpheus down more stairs and more twisty halls into a great oval room. The roof was a curving dome, painted blue and decorated with the constellations. The floor was decorated in tiles that were such a dark green that they appeared black. Except where the light struck the flakes of gold embedded in the tiles and then they flashed and sparkled. Orpheus noticed that there was a great deal of light. On previous evenings, the rooms and halls had been lit with torches and candles. Red flickering light. But this room was glowing. The walls, which were of course black, somehow pulsed with a warm cool light. It was as if the moon were shining from every inch. Orpheus was placed at the end of a great line of people. He recognized many of the people from the banquets. Each person came up in their turn and spoke their petition to the King and Queen of this place. There was no question of who or which people were the rulers here. There were two great thrones on a dais that dominated one end of the room. But even if they had been sitting in camp chairs there would have been no mistaking them. The Queen, his eyes shied away from the King, was sitting in the throne on the right. She was a little thing. Her feet were curled beneath her and hidden beneath her green dress. Orpheus noticed that while her throne was the same height as her King's, there was an extra step to help her climb up onto her throne. She was not beautiful. Not in the way Euridice of the carefully curling ringlets and ivory pale skin was beautiful. Her face was too sharp and yet too round. But it was alive in a way that Orpheus had never seen before. Her smile flashed and there were dimples. Her hair was corn ripe and wrapped tight in a braided crown around her head. Her green eyes would wander over the audience and she would lean into her lord and whisper in his ear. Then she'd laugh. Her laugh was low and rich. Orpheus the poet, the singer, could feel it in his gut. As Orpheus grew closer, his eyes could no longer avoid the god of the Dead. He was almost twice the size of his Queen and broad in the chest. He sat perfectly still in his throne, watching each petitioner in turn. Speaking in a low baso voice. Sometimes, he leaned a little towards his Queen, and when she whispered to him, he would smile a little A very little. Like a crack in a dead tree. His skin was white. Not pale, not ivory, not milky. White. The absence of color. His hair was short and thick and black and wild. Curling in every direction. His short black beard was a shock on his white face. And then there were his eyes. They were not black as dark brown eyes are black. As Eurdicie's flashing brown eyes were black. They were the black of emptiness. The black of a starless sky. Just. Absolute. Still. Quiet. Left and Right. Right and Wrong. Orpheus came to the head of the line and looked into those eyes. Eyes that knew. That could see into his heart. That weighed him. And the young singer who had faced the sirens, and the harpies, and Charron, and the Kindly Ones, and Cerberus, all the underworld itself, was afraid. Looking in those eyes, he forgot speeches and words. Instead he began to play a melody that had been in his mind since he spoke with Charron on the banks of the river Styx. Since he had begun to wander through this land of sights and sighs. There were no words. It was not a song of words. It was melody of dissonance. A song that spoke of wanderings. Chances not taken. Roads not followed. Opportunities cut short. The melody ended on a suspension, a broken note. Unfinished. Incomplete. And he looked up at the great Lord of Dis, into his great and terrible eyes, now not quite so terrible because they were full of tears, and asked him how the story would end. If he would give Euridice another chance at life. Give them another chance at happiness. Now at this point it should be said that Orpheus was very lucky. Well, not so much lucky as helped by the assistance of a good crusty kind old man. For you see, Charron had waited to take him across until the first day of fall. If Charron had ferried Orpheus across when Orpheus had arrived, then Orpheus would have arrived at the City of Dis and found only the Lord of the Dead making judgements in his hall. There would have been no colorful Queen of Springtime to lean to her husband and whisper that everyone deserves a second chance. Only a black and white King who can be moved to tears by songs but not to judgement. But Orpheus was lucky and blessed and that was that. The King glanced at his Queen and smiled at little and then he spoke in his deep bass voice, deep as the earth, rumbling through every cell of Orpheus' body. He said that Euridice was lost to herself, but could easily be found. That in the morning, Orpheus should go out of the city and back the way that he had come. That Euridice would follow him from behind, back into the sunlit world about. That she because she was so lost, she would not be able to speak to him until they were in the sun again. That Orpheus should trust in his love and not look at her until he had gone back into the world of the living. That if he looked at her, (for in every curse or blessing there must be an if) if he turned around, then she would die again. Orpheus was so happy that he forgot himself enough to smile at the dread King of Tartarus and stammered his thanks. That night at the banquet, he played music all night long. He couldn't sleep. Happy songs, sprightly and quick. Slow songs, loving soft. He sang the song of the world with the sirens, he was interested to learn the words. Drinking songs with the satyrs. Sailing songs with the sailors, home from the sea. Hunting songs with the hunters, home from the hill. And everyone danced, even the King and Queen, he so big and deep slow and she so small and color quick. And the walls glowed with the light like the full moon. And in the morning...although the quick witted will note that there really is no night or day beneath the earth, but for our purposes there was and is and are. In the morning, Orpheus set out. He walked past the gates of Tartarus where the Erinies stood and called. He did not ask them if Euridice was there. They might lie. They might tell the truth. Was she there. Was she not. He walked back through the tilled fields and toiling shades. And although he listened, he could not hear a single sound from Euridice. Her name like honey upon his tongue. At first he walked in silence, listening. Then he sang songs to her when he could not stand it. Was she there. Was she not. He walked back through the spring time lush meadows and groves white with blossoms. Scarlet butterflies danced among the flowers. And shades skipped in and out of view. The air was rich with the song of sparrows and robins and cooing doves. Orpheus strained his ears for the sound of Euridice's footsteps in the grass, but he couldn't hear her. Was she there. Was she not. He walked back through the glowing wood. Filled with golden light and drifting dust. He could hear chimes and birds and laughing shades, but he could not hear Euridice. He tried to feel her gaze on the back of his head, but he couldn't. Was she there. Was she not. He walked back though the autumn groves with their drifting golden leaves. He passed a white crane by a still pond, reflecting in the water. He did not look. He was not sure if that would be cheating. Better not to chance it. But he could not help but wonder. Was she there, was she not. He walked back to the curving black bridge over the ice white, water black river with its waiting, waiting shades. Back through the crackling wintry wood. He listened for her foot steps on the icy path. Nothing. Was she there, was she not. He walked back across the howling plains of asphodel. He could not hear his own steps, much less hers. He came back to the great river Styx. Its width so wide, none can see across. And there the old man waited, his red eyes glowing. The old man grumbled at him and told him to get in the front of the boat. Young people these days. Going in and out. In his day, the dead had stayed dead and the living stayed with the living. Orpheus took heart at Charron's words. Surely she was there, sitting at the other end of the boat. But he dared not ask, dared not speak. In silence, the old man pushed them across the great wide river. Orpheus smiled at the old man and jumped from the boat. His feet light with anticipation. He rushed up the cavern and around the bend towards the light. He thought of her. Her face, her hair, her flashing eyes. He had to see her. And alas, as the story goes one step away from the cavern's mouth, Orpheus anticipated the light a moment too soon and turned to look at his heart's delight, her name a song in his heart. And with a shriek and a moan and a sigh, she wept and turned to make the weary way back into the world of the dead. Now if this were the end of the tale, it would be a sorry story indeed. Although, as in any story worth its weight in salt, it gets worse before it gets better. Orpheus wept bitter tears, but he cried in silence. There was nothing left to anticipate. Nothing left to do. Well, there was one thing. Live his life and wait for them to be together again. And so he did his best. He traveled the world again and saw many wonders and waited for age or some wild creature to end his life. Which taking for all in all was a pretty good plan, except of course for one thing. He had eaten of the food from Hades table. Now, if an immortal eats the food in the land of the dead, it means that one day they will have to go there. That they too can die. But if a mortal man freely eats the food freely given from Hades' table, it means something else entirely. It means that like the dead, he will never grow old, never change. Part of that is that he cannot die. So, Orpheus didn't grow old. Didn't die. While all the hero's of the age, grew old and died, he wandered and wandered. Theseus went to Hades and escaped, and then in his turn too, died. Herakles, son of Zeus, died poisoned by his wife. Jason, of the Argo, grew old and died. Orpheus wandered and sang and adventured and eventually learned to wait. He learned to sit still. He grew wise. It could happen to anyone. However, even the wise can be struck by chance, just as fools can rush in. One day as he sat in his vineyard playing on a lute, which is like a lyre, but isn't, the Maenads came. When in their wine drenched frenzy, they attacked him, he though that he might finally die. But no, the food from Hades is table is stronger, stranger magic than that. And as you will recall, he did fall head first in the river Styx. They tore at him with screams and blood soaked fingers. And when they were done, as hard as it is to believe, all that was left was his head, which they tossed into the sea. And singing, he floated to the isle of Lesbos. Now some will ask how he could sing without a body. But such questions belong in stories of math and figures and philosophy and have no place here. When Orpheus' head, which we will call Orpheus, reached the shores of that fair island, a little boy with black curling hair found him. The boy picked him up and looked at this marvelous thing. Bragged to his brothers and his sisters that none of them had a talking head. Took Orpheus home to his father and his mother, who didn't want a talking head anywhere near their house. And after a time, Orpheus ended up the temple of Calliope, where he could be cared for. Where he could sing to the people who came to see him. And they came from all over. Some came to see the talking head. An amazing wonder even in those days of sirens and dragons and dancing stones. The less said of these the better. Some came for song and poetry and to learn their craft. Like Vedek, and Lyona, and Homer, before he went blind. Some came to learn wisdom, for as has been said, Orpheus had learned to be wise. Like Gillia, and Imix, and Branoc, from the white cliffs of Morna. Now, if the tale ended here, this would be a sad story indeed. However, for those who like truth there is a thing that should always be remembered. A song is only lovely because it strings notes together. Sometimes dissonant, sometimes sweet. Anticipation is only a lovely word because it promises something new. That even the song of the world ultimately has an end. So, one day as Orpheus sat drowsing in the late summer heat, a flock of scarlet butterflies came up from the rich dark earth and came to the temple where he lay. They fluttered and danced and covered him like a drift of red snow. In their tiny hands, they each carried bread from a faraway table. So, he ate the bread and as you know, when an immortal freely eats the food from Hades table, that immortal can then die. And so he ate and drowsed and closing his eyes, he fell into that final expectant sleep.",

      "No nightingale she to fly away with Orpheus, but no pigeon either.",
      "To extend the metaphor to its farthest reach, let us call her a dove.",
      "Orpheus certainly called her a dove and goddess and much more as he wrote songs and poems, paeans and odes to the wonder that was the girl next door.",
      "And yet, Orpheus needed the story of the road.",
      "The quick adventure of this and that.",
      "Anticipation, adventure, release.",
      "So, as soon as he could, he did.",
      "It was as much his nature as his voice was tenor sweet.",
      "When Orpheus left, the two lovers tremblingly clasped hands and lips.",
      "Swore on their honor that their love was eternal.",
      "That Orpheus would return to Euridice of the curling black hair.",
      "That Euridice would remain true to Orpheus whose music could make the Muses weep.",
      "Parting seemed a torment to the young lovers and yet young love loves to feed on torment.",
      "Orpheus set out on his road to the world and wrote sweet songs of his beloved, of their love, and of his sorrow.",
      "Euridice in her turn put off her white clothes and wore black, which was quite becoming to one with such thick curling black hair, such pallor of skin, such flashing brown eyes.",
      "And so the dove became a raven and in so doing found that she liked being the black and moody one.",
      "True, an odd delight, but really not uncommon.",
      "She took to wandering the local graveyards and painting pictures of cypress trees while she thought of Orpheus far away.",
      "Orpheus went into the world and had many adventures.",
      "He teased the Muses in their revels.",
      "He soothed dragons in their labors.",
      "He even accompanied Jason upon the Argo on the fateful quest for the golden fleece.",
      "And when they came to where the sirens sang upon the shore, the sirens paid tribute to Orpheus' voice be ceasing to sing, by swimming playfully along side the boat.",
      "But these are all stories for other days.",
      "Now when Orpheus had traveled for a time, it came to him that his feet were weary, and that he was tired of singing love songs for his distant beautiful Euridice.",
      "So, he began the long journey home.",
      "Each step a little lighter, filled as it was with the expectation of seeing his love.",
      "Around the familiar bend he came.",
      "Singing with joy, playing upon his lyre made from a tortoise shell.",
      "The rocks and trees swayed to the happy tune.",
      "Joyful expectation was met by joy as he saw her in a field.",
      "Dressed in her black, her face carefully shaded to preserve the pallor of her sorrow.",
      "This was not quite how Euridice had imagined Orpheus' return.",
      "Somehow it had always involved a pale and sorrowing Orpheus returning to find that poor faithful Euridice had pined away from loneliness.",
      "That on seeing her grave, he would fall to the earth weeping and in so doing die of a broken heart.",
      "Or that she would get some illness whose grip would leave even her paler yet and that as she lay dying, Orpheus would return.",
      "And that she would say this or that poignant thing and then die.",
      "Or perhaps his sweet singing would bring her back to life.",
      "Or still further, she had imagined that Orpheus himself would return, injured or sick.",
      "and that by her careful nursing, she would bring him back to life.",
      "And as a repentant and broken man, he would swear to always remain at her side and wander again no more.",
      "She had not imagined that would she be plucking weeds in a field when he returned.",
      "She had not imagined him singing with joy.",
      "She threw down her trowel.",
      "Gathered up her long flowing black robes, which were a little too long to run in and flung herself at him.",
      "For a little time at least, there was no singing.",
      "And so we come to anticipation, expectation, and desire.",
      "They quickly planned a wedding feast.",
      "Oh, the torments they suffered, a whole week's wait to their wedding day.",
      "Although, it should be mentioned that they did in fact anticipate their wedding night on the very night that Orpheus returned.",
      "But that is as young love should be, a joy that cannot be delayed.",
      "Then the day came.",
      "Orpheus, with his wine dark voice, and Euridice, with her face perfect oval pale and ivory smooth, plighted their troth in the temple to Hera.",
      "After the wedding, there was food and wine, music and dancing long into the night.",
      "And as soon as they could, which was very soon, the young lovers crept off to plight their troth in other ways.",
      "Here we leave them for a bit in the soft rich night with the moon shining down.",
      "For such are private things and do not concern us.",
      "In the morning, Euridice woke and stretched.",
      "A haystack is only romantic by moon light and by morning it is an uncomfortable place to have slept.",
      "But she was young and Orpheus was young and they had all the time in the world before them.",
      "Orpheus had returned and she was done with waiting in the graveyard although possibly not black.",
      "For as has been said, it was a color that suited her and it was in her nature to be a raven.",
      "These were her thoughts as she climbed down off the hay, tugging at Orpheus, who was not quite ready to get up.",
      "The thoughts of the little green snake at the foot of the hay stack were likewise simple.",
      "It wanted a rat to eat and for the day to begin.",
      "Now when a girl meets a snake, several things can happen.",
      "In this case, she screamed and startled the little snake.",
      "And so frightened, it struck.",
      "Biting her on one of her trim ankles.",
      "Frightened she fell and knew in an instance that she was dying.",
      "How odd.",
      "That this was all the time in the world that she was to have.",
      "No poetic last words, just sleep.",
      "And Orpheus wept as Euridice had imagined he would.",
      "He lay across her weeping.",
      "And because he was a singer, he sang his tears and the sky opened up in sympathy.",
      "For in those days, the world and singers were on speaking terms.",
      "He thought to kill himself with a knife, with poison, with something.",
      "But it was not in his character any more than he could have sung a note off key.",
      "He considered potions and magic.",
      "But as the brown villagers told him, dead is dead and that all there was to be done was to bury her.",
      "However, Orpheus was a poet and a dreamer.",
      "An adventurer who deeds were light quick.",
      "In a moment he decided.",
      "He would go to the realm of the dead and win the Euridice back to life.",
      "He gathered some food from the wedding feast and set off.",
      "After Orpheus left, Euridice's parents buried their little raven in a quiet tomb with words and incense.",
      "Orpheus traveled for many months in the direction that a door to the afterlife was said to lie.",
      "In truth, it was a very boring journey.",
      "He sang for his supper and slept in fields.",
      "He met no fierce creatures.",
      "Had no wild adventures.",
      "And since more interesting things lie ahead, we shall gloss over this part.",
      "At the end of his journey, he came to a great black cave in scraggly brown scrub.",
      "Through this cave lay the world of the dead.",
      "The cave exhaled cold dank air into the late summer afternoon.",
      "Orpheus did not stop.",
      "Did not hesitate.",
      "He strode into the cave.",
      "And quickly strode out again so that he could light his torch.",
      "When he was ready, he set out down the long narrow way.",
      "After a time and a half, the cave opened up on a great vast cavern.",
      "It was somewhat brighter here.",
      "There was a strange glowing mist, full of voices and sighs.",
      "After a few steps, Orpheus came to a river.",
      "Well, actually, he tripped and fell head first in it.",
      "It was bone cold.",
      "He scrambled back to the shore.",
      "He looked around.",
      "To his left, he could dimly see a small dock, with a little boat and a little man.",
      "He walked briskly towards it.",
      "The man was old and bent.",
      "He had a long white beard, which is not all that unusual, and burning yellow eyes, which is.",
      "Orpheus walked up to the old man without a pause and asked if this was the way to the underworld?",
      "If this was the great wide river Styx.",
      "If the old man was the ferryman.",
      "The old man chewed on a bit of straw and allowed that yes this was the way to the underworld, although why a living man should care, he didn't know.",
      "That this was the river Styx, although whether it was great or not he couldn't say.",
      "And that yes he was the ferryman, although most people called him Charon, or old man, or you there.",
      "Orpheus was excited, the real adventure could now begin.",
      "He told Charron who he was and how he had journeyed the wild world over.",
      "How he had loved the lovely Euridice, her name which rolled like blossoms off Orpheus' tongue.",
      "How they had been reunited after a long separation.",
      "How on the morning after their wedding, she had died.",
      "How he had come to the realm of the dead to seek her out and win her back to the warm world above.",
      "Charron allowed that this was a very pretty story and very well told.",
      "Not like some poets these days who liked to tell stories that made no sense or in which everyone was ugly or philosophers ride around in balloons.",
      "No, an excellent story all around.",
      "But as he chewed on his bit of straw, he didn't quite see what it had to do with him.",
      "And anyway, there were a number of things Charron didn't quite understand.",
      "If Orpheus had loved Euridice so much, why did he wait so long to marry her?",
      "Well, why did he have to go wander the world?",
      "Couldn't he have played music at home in his village?",
      "Well, why didn't Euridice go with him?",
      "Well, if you want one thing out of life and she wants another, then are you sure that you were meant to be together?",
      "Well, obviously a village wasn't all that safe now was it?",
      "And, what did a young man with a beautiful young woman want with danger?",
      "Why was he looking for Euridice now?",
      "Why couldn't he just wait to see her when he died?",
      "If he loved Euridice so much, why did he wait so long to marry her?",
      "And around and around and around.",
      "Orpheus got a little agitated here.",
      "He explained in quick sharp words how he needed to cross the river.",
      "No good, Charron just chewed on his bit of straw.",
      "Orpheus was ready to despair, which only made Charron tell him to buck up and here, have an onion.",
      "That it would make a man of him.",
      "Orpheus did not want an onion.",
      "He wanted to cross the river.",
      "To be with his one true love.",
      "He thought of her black hair, her flashing eyes and he was filled with anticipation, with desire, with despair that he would never cross the damned River Styx.",
      "Charron told Orpheus not to get so glum so fast and anyway Orpheus should make himself useful and play an old man a jig.",
      "So, Orpheus did and Charron listened.",
      "The sand of the shore began to jump with the rhythm.",
      "Charron allowed that Orpheus wasn't a half bad musician, but he still wasn't going to take Orpheus across the river.",
      "And today, he had things to do, important things.",
      "That Orpheus was just going to have to wait.",
      "Now as you may have gathered, Orpheus wasn't good at waiting.",
      "But there wasn't much else that he could do.",
      "The river was too wide and cold and weird.",
      "So, he ate his food and played jigs and cheery songs to lighten the wait in that cheerless place.",
      "The days past: one, two, three, seven, nine.",
      "And then one day Charron said, as if he had never told Orpheus to wait, that he should get in the boat already.",
      "That they didn't have all day.",
      "They set out into the mist in Charron's little craft.",
      "Charron pushing the boat with his long pole.",
      "Orpheus playing sea songs on his lyre.",
      "The sound of Orpheus' songs echoed on the still water.",
      "Hung in the wet white mist.",
      "When they reached the far shore, Charron gave Orpheus directions.",
      "To the Elysian Fields, which were quite nice this time of year.",
      "To Tartarus, although he doubted he'd need to go there what with Orpheus' lady being so nice and all.",
      "To the House of Hades, because Lord Hades really would need to approve any dead people picking up and leaving and all that.",
      "Orpheus shivered when Charron said the name of the Lord of Many.",
      "It was bad luck to say the name of the Lord of the Shady Realms, which is why he has so many names.",
      "On the other hand, Orpheus was alive and walking through the underworld, which some might say was bad luck.",
      "Orpheus set off away from the river.",
      "He walked across vast howling plains filled with asphodel which blooms white and strange.",
      "He walked through a dense forested thicket with black and gnarled branches.",
      "The leafless trees groaned and shrieked in the still air.",
      "Strange birds with maidens faces, covered in the foulest filth, crouched in the trees and rent the black branches with sharp claws.",
      "He played a soft romantic melody on his lyre, shiny with use, and they crooned to themselves and did not bother him.",
      "He came to a small black bridge over an icy river.",
      "Quiet shades waited on either shore of the river.",
      "Translucent pale, like white shadows.",
      "They shifted and moved along the river banks.",
      "Murmuring to each other.",
      "To the river.",
      "And the river would answer in cracks and groans and trickles.",
      "White mist rose from the river into the air.",
      "As Orpheus stood on the lacquered black bridge, curved like an upside down smile, one of the shades stepped into the river.",
      "It, for Orpheus could not tell if it had been man or woman, ducked into and under the black water.",
      "It emerged dripping with ice.",
      "And then with a sigh, the edges of the shade blurred and spread.",
      "The white shade dissipated into the mist around it.",
      "Orpheus shivered in the cold air and walked on.",
      "He walked through groves of golden trees with round shimmering leaves like coins.",
      "The air was sharp and crisp and crackled.",
      "Leaves red and gold and brown drifted into the yellow grass and crunched beneath his feet.",
      "Shades wandered through the trees.",
      "They were more solid than the shades of the winter thicket.",
      "They had faces and features and gender.",
      "However, they walked in sighing contemplation of the drifting leaves and did not answer when Orpheus asked them if they knew of Euridice.",
      "He walked on.",
      "The trees grew green the farther that he walked.",
      "The grass grew lush under his feet.",
      "The air warm and glowing, effulgent.",
      "Which was odd, since there was no sun, and yet everything had a golden glow.",
      "There was the sound of distant chimes.",
      "He walked on.",
      "The meadows between the trees became flocked with flowers and busy scarlet butterflies.",
      "A playful breeze struck a copse of flowering trees and Orpheus was surrounded in a sudden drift of white and pink flowers.",
      "The air was sweet with visions of what might be.",
      "Surely he would find Euridice here.",
      "Orpheus walked purposefully along the wooded paths.",
      "Singing as he walked.",
      "Shades playing hide and seek among the ferns, rose up to greet him.",
      "But they did not know Euridice of the black ringlets and flashing eyes.",
      "Orpheus continued to sing.",
      "It was a vast wood and full of spirits.",
      "His song drew shades that skipped like butterflies and danced like children in the grass.",
      "But no one knew anything of Euridice of the deep bosom and trim ankles.",
      "He walked on and on.",
      "And then there was an end to the wood.",
      "He walked through misty fields where spirits tilled the earth as they had when they lived under the sun.",
      "Orpheus thought he saw his parents, but since he had had nothing to say to them when they were alive, he walked on.",
      "Orpheus came to a great iron wall, red with rust.",
      "He walked along the edge until he came to a gate that lay open, broken at the hinges.",
      "There were four women standing at the gate.",
      "Although they looked nothing alike, they were somehow all the same.",
      "Four sisters with pale blue white eyes and wild icorous red hair.",
      "They wore red and black and blood.",
      "They each held a black scorpion flail.",
      "The Erinies, who torment the wicked.",
      "They seemed to move oddly to Orpheus' eye.",
      "It was as if he could not quite perceive their motion.",
      "One moment they were standing at the gate and then, as if he had blinked his eyes, (although he had not) they surrounded him.",
      "The crone commented that he was a pretty chicken and pinched his arm.",
      "Stung him with her long, long nails.",
      "The warrior cinched tight in leather black ran her hand across his shoulders and asked him if he had come to play.",
      "The mother, who one moment seemed to be knitting, and then in the next had only a poisonous black flail, commented that he was a little lamb and that he would make good wool.",
      "The maiden in her stained dress asked him if he had been bad.",
      "And they all laughed together that everyone is bad.",
      "Orpheus addressed them as politely as he could.",
      "Gracious Kindly Ones.",
      "Alecto, whose anger is unceasing.",
      "Tisiphone, avenger of murder.",
      "Nemesis, unceasing retribution.",
      "Megaera, jealous of the world.",
      "He tried to sing to them.",
      "Nemesis flashed and disappeared to his right.",
      "Megaera shifted in and out on his left.",
      "Alecto and Tisiphone circled around the edges of his eyes.",
      "They quieted him with fingers and hands and scorpion tips.",
      "Shhhh, for that was not the kind of music that they liked.",
      "He pleaded for assistance in finding Euridice who had been killed so young.",
      "So, unfairly.",
      "Megaera kissed the green hydra that suddenly appeared wrapped around her bent shoulders and smiled an old woman's mad smile.",
      "Leather clad Tisiphone flashed in front of him and cracked the air next to Orpheus cheek with her whip.",
      "Then just as sudden, she leaned over his shoulder and whispered in a voice of scratched dark delights that Euridice's death wasn't what she'd call killing.",
      "He pleaded to Nemesis's mother love, for she had been the mother of the fair Helen and dark Clytemnestra.",
      "Nemesis replied with a mother's plump calm that she had driven her own grandson mad and she smiled a smile that was all quiet and reason and menace.",
      "He begged Alecto, youngest of the sisters born of patricide and blood soaked dirt, for entry into Tartarus.",
      "She looked up at him from her red game in the red dirt and declared that she was bored now.",
      "That she wanted to play.",
      "Nemesis shushed her and told Orpheus that of course he could go look in Tartarus and even come out again.",
      "But if he tried to take any of their little duckling, then they'd have to flay him stem to stern.",
      "Little Alecto jumped up from the dirt and gripped Orpheus hand, dragged him through the rusting iron gate.",
      "She dragged him past Sisyphus and his rolling rock and Tartatarus standing in his lake.",
      "Past people that he knew.",
      "Past people that he didn't.",
      "People on fire and people encased in ice.",
      "Through shrieks and moans, which sweet faced Alecto called singing and pretty, very, very pretty.",
      "However, Orpheus did not see Euridice.",
      "Alecto dragged him back out the gate and she let go of his hand.",
      "They laughed and crackled at him as he walked as fast away as his feet could walk.",
      "By the time he could feel his hand again, Alecto had had quite a grip, he could see a great dark shape in the distance.",
      "As he grew closer, he could see that it was great building of spires and sharp pointed gates and walls.",
      "Orpheus grew closer and he could see that the walls were covered with spikes and spines.",
      "Carrion birds sat upon the spires and the air was filled with the sound of raucous calls.",
      "As Orpheus approached the nearest gate.",
      "A great black thing ran round the city.",
      "It was the size of a black bull.",
      "It barked and snarled from three dog's red mouths full of yellow teeth.",
      "Its coat was tangled and wild.",
      "All six eyes were red and burned with white flame.",
      "Its feet were the size of serving plates and its tail was serpent black and covered in scales.",
      "Orpheus did not hesitate.",
      "He began a simple melody on his tortoise green lyre.",
      "Quiet and low.",
      "Soft and calming.",
      "The great beast ceased to bark.",
      "Orpheus walked closer.",
      "He began to sing a lullaby.",
      "The creature circled on itself three times and sat down.",
      "Its red eyes blinked at Orpheus.",
      "Once, twice, closed.",
      "The thing began to sleep.",
      "Orpheus could smell the stench of its fowl breath as he edged by it and up to the gate.",
      "He knocked softly, so as not to wake the beast.",
      "A little window opened in the wall and a little white head stuck out.",
      "Name.",
      "It asked.",
      "Orpheus explained that he was looking for his true love Euridice.",
      "Name?",
      "It asked again.",
      "Orpheus told the head his name.",
      "The head ducked in the window and there was a sound of scratching.",
      "The head reappeared.",
      "Occupation?",
      "It asked.",
      "Orpheus replied that he was a poet.",
      "The head didn't seem to think very well of this answer.",
      "There was more scratching.",
      "When Orpheus had answered a great many questions about his age, and favorite color, and demographic, and why he was there, and where he saw himself in five years...the mighty black gate creaked open.",
      "Orpheus glanced at the beast.",
      "It continued to sleep.",
      "Orpheus was let into a great courtyard lined with black and blue stones.",
      "A little white man, attached to the question asking head, led him into the house of the Lord of Tartarus.",
      "He was assigned a room.",
      "Told not to wander from it.",
      "Orpheus had no intention of doing so.",
      "He tried to ask if he could see the Lord Clymenus which means the Illustrious.",
      "Orpheus could not bring himself to name Hades by his proper name, for it was bad luck.",
      "The little man cut him off.",
      "He was told to freshen for dinner.",
      "Although, if he was mortal, he really ought not to eat anything.",
      "This was unfortunate.",
      "Orpheus had run out of food.",
      "Orpheus sat on the edge of the black bed in the room furnished in teak with adamantine floors and walls.",
      "He played a simple melody and waited in hope.",
      "In a few hours, the little man reappeared and brought him down through winding stairs and twisting halls to a great room.",
      "The ceiling was so high that it disappeared into the black.",
      "The walls were of black stone and decorated with hangings of spring fields and meadows and wood nymphs and children.",
      "They looked new.",
      "In fact, at one end of the room, Orpheus could see servants hanging tapestries and colorful draperies of green and gold.",
      "In the center of the room was a great stone table, black and carved with scenes of judgement and death.",
      "It was piled high with fresh cut flowers.",
      "There was food hidden between the flowers and the scent was over poweringly sweet.",
      "Orpheus tried not to sneeze.",
      "The room was filled with people in all manner of dress.",
      "Old and young.",
      "There were men and women.",
      "Humans, black and white.",
      "Satyrs drinking their wine.",
      "Fauns playing skipping games.",
      "Sirens practicing their singing.",
      "One of them waved at Orpheus.",
      "He waved back.",
      "The noise was deafening.",
      "Orpheus felt dizzy and very, very hungry.",
      "He looked around at all of the crowding people.",
      "No one was watching.",
      "He had bit of bread and felt instantly better.",
      "He looked to see if he could find the Lord Chthonios zeus.",
      "But no one looked godlike.",
      "Or those that did, did not like they were gods of a place like this.",
      "He approached one of the sirens and asked if they knew where the King and Queen of the dead were or when they would be coming.",
      "The siren giggled in her feathers and said that they would not be seeing them tonight.",
      "Maybe tomorrow.",
      "If they were lucky.",
      "That it had been a really long hot summer and fall.",
      "And then she fell to giggling with her sisters.",
      "Orpheus could not get them to make any more sensible remarks and went back to surreptitiously grazing from the table.",
      "That night he tried to sleep in the black bed, beneath black sheets, but he couldn't.",
      "He was full of expectation.",
      "Practicing the things that he would say and do when he saw the Lord Pluton, Pluto, Lord of the Dead, Judge, Lord Arbiter.",
      "His mind shied away from the name Hades.",
      "Better not to even think it.",
      "Better not jinx his chances.",
      "The next day, he waited and thought.",
      "He was not good at waiting.",
      "He was a doer.",
      "So he practiced his many songs.",
      "If he had looked, he would have seen a small crowd gathered under his window.",
      "People dancing to the music.",
      "But he didn't look, so he never knew.",
      "That night he went to another banquet.",
      "The same vast room.",
      "The same great table.",
      "The black walls with the same hangings and bright cloth.",
      "There were fresh flowers on the table.",
      "Orpheus had an odd sense that the house was happy.",
      "But he decided it was just the smell of the flowers getting to him.",
      "He nibbled on some more bread and cheese and chatted with mythic and mortal things.",
      "The next day was the pattern of the first and the next.",
      "Orpheus would wait and practice.",
      "People would gather and dance.",
      "Orpheus went to the banquet.",
      "The crowds would gather and talk.",
      "But the Lord and Lady of the place never appeared.",
      "On the fourth day, the little man came to Orphesus' room.",
      "He told him that the Lord Hades was seeing petitions today.",
      "And because his lady was in a mood for music and poetry, his name had been moved to the end of today's list.",
      "And then the little man led Orpheus down more stairs and more twisty halls into a great oval room.",
      "The roof was a curving dome, painted blue and decorated with the constellations.",
      "The floor was decorated in tiles that were such a dark green that they appeared black.",
      "Except where the light struck the flakes of gold embedded in the tiles and then they flashed and sparkled.",
      "Orpheus noticed that there was a great deal of light.",
      "On previous evenings, the rooms and halls had been lit with torches and candles.",
      "Red flickering light.",
      "But this room was glowing.",
      "The walls, which were of course black, somehow pulsed with a warm cool light.",
      "It was as if the moon were shining from every inch.",
      "Orpheus was placed at the end of a great line of people.",
      "He recognized many of the people from the banquets.",
      "Each person came up in their turn and spoke their petition to the King and Queen of this place.",
      "There was no question of who or which people were the rulers here.",
      "There were two great thrones on a dais that dominated one end of the room.",
      "But even if they had been sitting in camp chairs there would have been no mistaking them.",
      "The Queen, his eyes shied away from the King, was sitting in the throne on the right.",
      "She was a little thing.",
      "Her feet were curled beneath her and hidden beneath her green dress.",
      "Orpheus noticed that while her throne was the same height as her King's, there was an extra step to help her climb up onto her throne.",
      "She was not beautiful.",
      "Not in the way Euridice of the carefully curling ringlets and ivory pale skin was beautiful.",
      "Her face was too sharp and yet too round.",
      "But it was alive in a way that Orpheus had never seen before.",
      "Her smile flashed and there were dimples.",
      "Her hair was corn ripe and wrapped tight in a braided crown around her head.",
      "Her green eyes would wander over the audience and she would lean into her lord and whisper in his ear.",
      "Then she'd laugh.",
      "Her laugh was low and rich.",
      "Orpheus the poet, the singer, could feel it in his gut.",
      "As Orpheus grew closer, his eyes could no longer avoid the god of the Dead.",
      "He was almost twice the size of his Queen and broad in the chest.",
      "He sat perfectly still in his throne, watching each petitioner in turn.",
      "Speaking in a low baso voice.",
      "Sometimes, he leaned a little towards his Queen, and when she whispered to him, he would smile a little A very little.",
      "Like a crack in a dead tree.",
      "His skin was white.",
      "Not pale, not ivory, not milky.",
      "White.",
      "The absence of color.",
      "His hair was short and thick and black and wild.",
      "Curling in every direction.",
      "His short black beard was a shock on his white face.",
      "And then there were his eyes.",
      "They were not black as dark brown eyes are black.",
      "As Eurdicie's flashing brown eyes were black.",
      "They were the black of emptiness.",
      "The black of a starless sky.",
      "Just.",
      "Absolute.",
      "Still.",
      "Quiet.",
      "Left and Right.",
      "Right and Wrong.",
      "Orpheus came to the head of the line and looked into those eyes.",
      "Eyes that knew.",
      "That could see into his heart.",
      "That weighed him.",
      "And the young singer who had faced the sirens, and the harpies, and Charron, and the Kindly Ones, and Cerberus, all the underworld itself, was afraid.",
      "Looking in those eyes, he forgot speeches and words.",
      "Instead he began to play a melody that had been in his mind since he spoke with Charron on the banks of the river Styx.",
      "Since he had begun to wander through this land of sights and sighs.",
      "There were no words.",
      "It was not a song of words.",
      "It was melody of dissonance.",
      "A song that spoke of wanderings.",
      "Chances not taken.",
      "Roads not followed.",
      "Opportunities cut short.",
      "The melody ended on a suspension, a broken note.",
      "Unfinished.",
      "Incomplete.",
      "And he looked up at the great Lord of Dis, into his great and terrible eyes, now not quite so terrible because they were full of tears, and asked him how the story would end.",
      "If he would give Euridice another chance at life.",
      "Give them another chance at happiness.",
      "Now at this point it should be said that Orpheus was very lucky.",
      "Well, not so much lucky as helped by the assistance of a good crusty kind old man.",
      "For you see, Charron had waited to take him across until the first day of fall.",
      "If Charron had ferried Orpheus across when Orpheus had arrived, then Orpheus would have arrived at the City of Dis and found only the Lord of the Dead making judgements in his hall.",
      "There would have been no colorful Queen of Springtime to lean to her husband and whisper that everyone deserves a second chance.",
      "Only a black and white King who can be moved to tears by songs but not to judgement.",
      "But Orpheus was lucky and blessed and that was that.",
      "The King glanced at his Queen and smiled at little and then he spoke in his deep bass voice, deep as the earth, rumbling through every cell of Orpheus' body.",
      "He said that Euridice was lost to herself, but could easily be found.",
      "That in the morning, Orpheus should go out of the city and back the way that he had come.",
      "That Euridice would follow him from behind, back into the sunlit world about.",
      "That she because she was so lost, she would not be able to speak to him until they were in the sun again.",
      "That Orpheus should trust in his love and not look at her until he had gone back into the world of the living.",
      "That if he looked at her, (for in every curse or blessing there must be an if) if he turned around, then she would die again.",
      "Orpheus was so happy that he forgot himself enough to smile at the dread King of Tartarus and stammered his thanks.",
      "That night at the banquet, he played music all night long.",
      "He couldn't sleep.",
      "Happy songs, sprightly and quick.",
      "Slow songs, loving soft.",
      "He sang the song of the world with the sirens, he was interested to learn the words.",
      "Drinking songs with the satyrs.",
      "Sailing songs with the sailors, home from the sea.",
      "Hunting songs with the hunters, home from the hill.",
      "And everyone danced, even the King and Queen, he so big and deep slow and she so small and color quick.",
      "And the walls glowed with the light like the full moon.",
      "And in the morning...although the quick witted will note that there really is no night or day beneath the earth, but for our purposes there was and is and are.",
      "In the morning, Orpheus set out.",
      "He walked past the gates of Tartarus where the Erinies stood and called.",
      "He did not ask them if Euridice was there.",
      "They might lie.",
      "They might tell the truth.",
      "Was she there.",
      "Was she not.",
      "He walked back through the tilled fields and toiling shades.",
      "And although he listened, he could not hear a single sound from Euridice.",
      "Her name like honey upon his tongue.",
      "At first he walked in silence, listening.",
      "Then he sang songs to her when he could not stand it.",
      "Was she there.",
      "Was she not.",
      "He walked back through the spring time lush meadows and groves white with blossoms.",
      "Scarlet butterflies danced among the flowers.",
      "And shades skipped in and out of view.",
      "The air was rich with the song of sparrows and robins and cooing doves.",
      "Orpheus strained his ears for the sound of Euridice's footsteps in the grass, but he couldn't hear her.",
      "Was she there.",
      "Was she not.",
      "He walked back through the glowing wood.",
      "Filled with golden light and drifting dust.",
      "He could hear chimes and birds and laughing shades, but he could not hear Euridice.",
      "He tried to feel her gaze on the back of his head, but he couldn't.",
      "Was she there.",
      "Was she not.",
      "He walked back though the autumn groves with their drifting golden leaves.",
      "He passed a white crane by a still pond, reflecting in the water.",
      "He did not look.",
      "He was not sure if that would be cheating.",
      "Better not to chance it.",
      "But he could not help but wonder.",
      "Was she there, was she not.",
      "He walked back to the curving black bridge over the ice white, water black river with its waiting, waiting shades.",
      "Back through the crackling wintry wood.",
      "He listened for her foot steps on the icy path.",
      "Nothing.",
      "Was she there, was she not.",
      "He walked back across the howling plains of asphodel.",
      "He could not hear his own steps, much less hers.",
      "He came back to the great river Styx.",
      "Its width so wide, none can see across.",
      "And there the old man waited, his red eyes glowing.",
      "The old man grumbled at him and told him to get in the front of the boat.",
      "Young people these days.",
      "Going in and out.",
      "In his day, the dead had stayed dead and the living stayed with the living.",
      "Orpheus took heart at Charron's words.",
      "Surely she was there, sitting at the other end of the boat.",
      "But he dared not ask, dared not speak.",
      "In silence, the old man pushed them across the great wide river.",
      "Orpheus smiled at the old man and jumped from the boat.",
      "His feet light with anticipation.",
      "He rushed up the cavern and around the bend towards the light.",
      "He thought of her.",
      "Her face, her hair, her flashing eyes.",
      "He had to see her.",
      "And alas, as the story goes one step away from the cavern's mouth, Orpheus anticipated the light a moment too soon and turned to look at his heart's delight, her name a song in his heart.",
      "And with a shriek and a moan and a sigh, she wept and turned to make the weary way back into the world of the dead.",
      "Now if this were the end of the tale, it would be a sorry story indeed.",
      "Although, as in any story worth its weight in salt, it gets worse before it gets better.",
      "Orpheus wept bitter tears, but he cried in silence.",
      "There was nothing left to anticipate.",
      "Nothing left to do.",
      "Well, there was one thing.",
      "Live his life and wait for them to be together again.",
      "And so he did his best.",
      "He traveled the world again and saw many wonders and waited for age or some wild creature to end his life.",
      "Which taking for all in all was a pretty good plan, except of course for one thing.",
      "He had eaten of the food from Hades table.",
      "Now, if an immortal eats the food in the land of the dead, it means that one day they will have to go there.",
      "That they too can die.",
      "But if a mortal man freely eats the food freely given from Hades' table, it means something else entirely.",
      "It means that like the dead, he will never grow old, never change.",
      "Part of that is that he cannot die.",
      "So, Orpheus didn't grow old.",
      "Didn't die.",
      "While all the hero's of the age, grew old and died, he wandered and wandered.",
      "Theseus went to Hades and escaped, and then in his turn too, died.",
      "Herakles, son of Zeus, died poisoned by his wife.",
      "Jason, of the Argo, grew old and died.",
      "Orpheus wandered and sang and adventured and eventually learned to wait.",
      "He learned to sit still.",
      "He grew wise.",
      "It could happen to anyone.",
      "However, even the wise can be struck by chance, just as fools can rush in.",
      "One day as he sat in his vineyard playing on a lute, which is like a lyre, but isn't, the Maenads came.",
      "When in their wine drenched frenzy, they attacked him, he though that he might finally die.",
      "But no, the food from Hades is table is stronger, stranger magic than that.",
      "And as you will recall, he did fall head first in the river Styx.",
      "They tore at him with screams and blood soaked fingers.",
      "And when they were done, as hard as it is to believe, all that was left was his head, which they tossed into the sea.",
      "And singing, he floated to the isle of Lesbos.",
      "Now some will ask how he could sing without a body.",
      "But such questions belong in stories of math and figures and philosophy and have no place here.",
      "When Orpheus' head, which we will call Orpheus, reached the shores of that fair island, a little boy with black curling hair found him.",
      "The boy picked him up and looked at this marvelous thing.",
      "Bragged to his brothers and his sisters that none of them had a talking head.",
      "Took Orpheus home to his father and his mother, who didn't want a talking head anywhere near their house.",
      "And after a time, Orpheus ended up the temple of Calliope, where he could be cared for.",
      "Where he could sing to the people who came to see him.",
      "And they came from all over.",
      "Some came to see the talking head.",
      "An amazing wonder even in those days of sirens and dragons and dancing stones.",
      "The less said of these the better.",
      "Some came for song and poetry and to learn their craft.",
      "Like Vedek, and Lyona, and Homer, before he went blind.",
      "Some came to learn wisdom, for as has been said, Orpheus had learned to be wise.",
      "Like Gillia, and Imix, and Branoc, from the white cliffs of Morna.",
      "Now, if the tale ended here, this would be a sad story indeed.",
      "However, for those who like truth there is a thing that should always be remembered.",
      "A song is only lovely because it strings notes together.",
      "Sometimes dissonant, sometimes sweet.",
      "Anticipation is only a lovely word because it promises something new.",
      "That even the song of the world ultimately has an end.",
      "So, one day as Orpheus sat drowsing in the late summer heat, a flock of scarlet butterflies came up from the rich dark earth and came to the temple where he lay.",
      "They fluttered and danced and covered him like a drift of red snow.",
      "In their tiny hands, they each carried bread from a faraway table.",
      "So, he ate the bread and as you know, when an immortal freely eats the food from Hades table, that immortal can then die.",
      "And so he ate and drowsed and closing his eyes, he fell into that final expectant sleep."

    "text": "Great Pharaoh is in his city of a thousand red gates. In the morning, he goes to the great pillared temple of Mighty Amun-Ra. Great Pharaoh prays the sun, his father, into the sky. He prays the light into the world. The wide green Nile flows through the two lands. Upper and lower. Red and white. Vulture and cobra. Ankh and flail. The entire world sails upon the river that flows down the middle. Great Pharaoh sends ships down the river and into the seas that wash the world beyond the two lands. The washed world sends back tribute and trade from across the seas. Serpent eyed Amathaunta coils restless in her sea. She pushes the tides and the waves with her movement. Her scales are blue and green and they glitter gold in the sun's light. Mighty Ra sails his golden ship across the fierce blue sky. In the morning, he is born from Sky Arching Nuit, whose dark skin glitters with stars. He sails his golden ship and lights the world. He sails his ship and in the evening, he grows old and dies. He slips past sky arching Nuit and into the world of the dead. Everything is in its place. Everything is as it should be. It is good. Neco is at sea. He is sailing home. The little boat, the Heron, bobs in the dancing blue water as the men row. Each morning, Neco and the other men sail out to catch wind and waves and fish. The fresh wind in Neco's face is the sweetest of perfumes. The blue water white with foam, Ra's light shining down, are Neco's lapis-lazuli, his ivory, his gold. Then each afternoon, he sails home to his treasure. Everything is in its place. Everything is as it should be. It is good. The drummer beats his drum. The men pull the wide oars through the lapping, sparkling water to that beat. The old wooden oar is smooth beneath Neco's hands. The air is full of sea and salt and sweat. Today, the Heron's hold is full of fish. Into the harbor of Kosseir, past the white breakwater, the drummer beats his drum and the men pull the oars. They jump from the boat to the white stone dock, throwing ropes and laughing. Laughing they carry the fish to be sold at market. The catch has been good. Neco goes to the busy market by the white stone docks and buys some grain meal. He goes to the tomb of his ancestors. He lights a fire and makes an offering of fish and grain to his mother and his father, to those who have come before. Neco prays. He walks fast down the red clay street to his red clay house and he is home. He puts down his part of the day's catch. Neco calls out to his treasure. Little Sepu, fat and naked, runs to the door and gurgles. Neco picks up Sepu and holds him high. Little Sepu waves his fat little arms and smiles. He has one tooth. His youths-lock is just a wisp of hair. Little Kirti is tugging at Neco's linen kilt. She wants papa to help her fly. So, after a hug and a kiss for Sepu, he picks up Kirti. She is almost too big for this. In another year, she will be too heavy. Neco holds her up as long as he can, but it has been a long day at sea. Soon, he must put her down. They walk through the house to the back. He carries little Sepu on his shoulders. Sepu beats Neco's head like a drum. Neco holds Kirti's hand in his as they walk. He asks Kirti if she has been good. If she has helped her mama watch Sepu. She chatters about her day. She brewed beer with mama. Sepu said, \"Goo.\" She kneaded dough that mama is making into black bread. They step into the red clay courtyard behind the house. It is shaded by a red brick wall, but it is still hot and bright. There is fresh bread on a stone. He smiles at his Mara, who is cutting onions for stew. She smiles at her Neco Everything is in its place. Everything is as it should be. It is good. For now. Tomorrow, Neco will sail away. The Lord of the Door to the South has decreed that a ship will sail to Pharaoh's gold mines with one hundred and fifty men with stout hearts. That the Great Horus in Flight, a mighty ship one hundred and fifty cubits long and forty cubits wide, will sail south. That in Huweitat, the men will go down into the earth to mine gold beneath the yellow cliffs. Go down until the Great Horus in Flight's hold is full of gold. The men will go down away from Mighty Ra in his heaven and Restless Amathaunta in her sea. Down into the earth away from Mara with her stew and Kirti as she grows too tall to fly and Sepu as says his first word that is not \"Goo.\" A year. Forever. Away. Tomorrow. Tonight, Neco is in his red clay house holding his Mara. Mara is on her reed mat bed holding her Neco. Close. Closer. Great Pharaoh is in his city of a hundred great temples. But Great Pharaoh of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare, Daughter of Ra, Khenmet-Amen Hatshepsut is far away. The wide muddy Nile flows through the middle of the world, but the Nile is far away. Serpent eyed Amathaunta is in her seas. Her daughters are restless. Mighty Ra is in the heavens. Each night Bright Burning Ra fights the dire serpent Apophis in the underworld. Mighty Ra fights so he can be reborn from Sky Arching Nuit. Be reborn to light the new day. It is tomorrow. Neco is sailing away. The drummer beats his drum and the sailors, the best who have seen heaven and earth, pull the oars. The captain had said that the wind would not be contrary, or that there would be none and indeed there is none. It is calm as the sailors pull their wide oars through the green waters. Past the white rocks where the daughters of Restless Amathaunta sit, combing their hair. Neco glances at them. They are ugly. Strange. Their heads are not shaved. They have long green hair, tangled with shells. Their skin is not brown. They have white skin, which shimmers like the underbelly of a shark. Their pale hips blend into fish tails that glitter in the sea spray. They call to the sailors by name. One of the women slides into the water and swims along side the ship, just out of reach of the oars. She smiles at Neco. Her eyes are yellow and slit like a cat's. They bulge slightly like a frog's. She reaches out pale white arms to Neco. She calls to him. She whispers that there is a cool white palace of pearl beneath the green sunlit waves waiting for him. That she longs for Neco in her red coral bed. That it will be dark beneath the stone. Don't go. Don't leave her. Slip into the water so that she can hold him in her arms. Come into the water so that she can cover his face in kisses. She has so many things to show him. So many things to tell him. One of the sailors jumps into the water. In a tail flip flash, the woman has the sailor in her thin white arms. Is pressing small white teeth to his sun weathered face and neck. He is smiling as she pulls him under the waves. The sailor does not resist as the woman's sisters swarm into the waters. Churning the waves to a white froth with their tails that glitter in Ra's light. Neco shivers at his oar in the warm morning sun. The ship has paid Serpent Eyed Amathaunta a willing due. The wind begins to blow from the north. Neco feels the smooth wood of the deck beneath his bare feet as he runs to raise the sail. He is alive. The green cotton sail catches the wind. Bells out and forward and the ship dances away from the white rocks where the daughters of Restless Amathaunta like to sit combing their long hair. The days pass. Neco counts them. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One day left. Tomorrow, they will reach the yellow cliffs where the sailors will go down into the dark earth to mine great Pharaoh's gold. Mighty Pharaoh is in his city of wide smooth roads. Neco is on the ship. The Great Horus in Flight is sailing fast before the wind on the waves. The wind is in Neco's face. Ra's warm gaze is on his back. They had said that the wind would not be contrary, or that there would be none. As the ship approaches the port of Huweitat, as the yellow cliffs come into view, the wind rises, and throws up waves eight cubits high. For the first time in Neco's life, in anyone's life, the hot blue sky turns dark. Fierce. Black clouds dare to hide Mighty Ra's light and icy water drenches down from the angry sky. Black waves toss the ship. Jagged lightening fingers slash the clouds. The sailors struggle to guide the Great Horus in Flight. The waves grow higher. The shrieking weeping wind slams the ship. The great mast cracks like a twig and falls away. It smashes five sailors as it tumbles into the sea. Neco grabs hold of a broken wooden plank as a wave casually plucks him up and into the sea. Swept down into a deep valley of water. Carried up to the top of a wave twenty cubits high, Neco can barely see the sailors scrambling as the ship snaps in two. When Neco reaches the top of the next wave, the ship is gone. Neco is alone in the black sea, clinging to a bit of wood. Neco thinks he sees mighty serpents flying on the howling winds, playing tag with the lightening. Neco thinks he sees the maiden, Amathaunta's daughter, reaching out to him with her white arms. Neco thinks he sees a great serpent's head, just beneath a black and silver wave. Its giant yellow eye staring at him as he floats helplessly. Neco makes himself see Mara and Kirti and Sepu and holds on. Hours. Days. Forever. Neco hears the sound of waves crashing on the shore. He kicks his bare feet in the cold water. He can barely feel them. He is so tired. He doesn't dare let go of his piece of wood, water logged in his cold arms. Holds on and closes his eyes and kicks in the direction of the roar. He tumbles onto the sandy shore. He crawls up the powder fine beach. Above, there is the arch of Curving Nuit's night sky skin and her glittering stars. Gentle Hathor's full round moon shines pale blue on the beach and waves. Neco looks out at the sea. He can see lightening and clouds. He closes his eyes and sees no more. In the morning, Neco wakes to see Mighty Ra high over head. Neco looks out at the sea. He looks out at the place where black clouds roil. Where lightening stabs clouds. Where rain and fierce wind laments some almost heard name. A storm ten cubits out from shore and clear sunlit skies. A white flake floats free of the storm. Neco catches it. It is cold and turns to water in his hand. Neco's mouth is dry with salt. Neco's eyes are red with waves. Neco pray to Serpent Eyed Amathaunta in thanks for sparing him. He prays to Sweet Kebechet for water, that Great Amathaunta's mercy might not be in vain. He prays for the sailors who sank beneath the waves. Men whose Ba's and Ka's might never be reunited. He prays to Amathaunta to send them to Great Osirus. He prays that Restless Amathaunta pity them and guide them to the land of the dead. Take them to where their Ba's and Ka's can become one. Where they will become light, be reborn as Akh in the land of the dead. Then he walks north along the shore. He must find water and food soon. He walks until he comes to a small cold stream that bubbles to the sea. Falls to his knees and drinks the cool clean water. He drinks life in gulps. A white fig tree grows next to the stream. Its limbs are heavy with plump purple fruit. He gobbles them up. Tiny seeds catching in his teeth, juice running down his chin, he eats. Ten cubits from shore, the storm still rages. Lightening slashes. Black waves toss beneath black clouds. Rain and wind wail. Neco looks away from the storm. He takes off his linen kilt. He gathers up figs in its folds. He walks down the shore. He passes cold streams. He passes fat orange melons growing ripe on green vines. He passes waving fat golden grain. He walks by splendid birds with blue and green and red feathers. He walks until he comes to the little bit of wood that had saved his life. Neco knows that he is on an island in the eye of a storm ten cubits out from where the waves meet the shore. Neco sits on the hot white sand. He listens to the howling wind. He looks at the slashing falling water and the moving, unmoving clouds. Neco weeps. Then he walks back to the first stream. If he is to see his family again, he must stay alive. Next to the cool stream, he lies down in a dark thicket and a shadow covers him. For three days, he is alone, without a companion beside his own heart. He hears it beating in his chest. He hears the sound of the sea. He makes a stone axe. He cuts down palm trees and lashes them together with seaweed. He sits on the sand and stares at the storm. It is black with clouds. It is silver with falling water where Mighty Ra's light hits the storm's edge. He stares and stares and sees a woman walking from the storm. She wears a long woven skirt of many colors. It is ripped. She is walking on the water. Her breasts are bare and bleed from where she scratches at them. She is weeping. Her black curling hair appears to have once been gathered high on her head, in the manner of Knossos. Now it is wild and streaked with ash. She walks over the waves. She walks onto shore. Neco bows down to the woman and says, \"Great Lady what distresses you so?\" The woman looks at him, her shore green eyes empty, \"My daughter, my Kore. I am looking for my daughter. Have you seen my little girl?\" Neco looks up at the woman, \"Great Lady whose grief so reflects my own, I wish I could give you news to gladden your heart, but I have seen no maiden since I was cast ashore upon a wave of the sea. When was she taken? What does your daughter, your Kore, look like?\" The woman's hands scratch at her arms, \"She is my golden haired Kore.\" The woman's hands pull at her hair. \"She is my blue eyed daughter.\" Her fingers tear at her face. \"She is my pale, sweet little one. My springtime dove.\" She wails. The storm wails back. Neco sighs, \"Great Lady, my heart weighs heavy against the truth that I must tell. I have seen no little girl with golden hair or blue eyes or pale skin like a dove before or after I was cast into the sea.\" Neco looks for some thing to offer this woman who walks over water, \"But Great Lady, pray do not grieve so. I am but a poor shipwrecked sailor, far from my family, but there is cool water to clean your cuts and ease your thirst. There is fruit to ease your hunger. There are trees to shelter you. Great Lady, may it please you to rest a moment that your search might go easier.\" But the woman does not hear him. She turns and walks back out into the storm. Neco watches her. Watches as her shape slips over waves and through falling water. Watches as she disappears from view. Neco considers a moment, his face thoughtful. Neco stops working on his raft. He makes a little throwing club for catching birds. Neco makes a little spear to catch fish in the stream. Neco gathers figs and melons and grain. He digs a pit and lights a fire. Puts birds and fish and figs and melons and grain into the fire and makes a burnt offering to the gods. He prays that Great Pharaoh may long rule in his city of electrum and temples. He prays that the Serpent Eyed Amathaunta will cause the Reed Sea to calm. That Mighty Ra will sail across fierce blue skies unmarred by clouds. That Fierce Horus will seek out the lost Kore with his immortal eye. That the world will be as it had always been. Everything good and in its place. As he prays, Mighty Ra travels across the blue sky from east to west. His ship slides from view behind black clouds and the sky turns pink and orange and gold. Suddenly, Neco hears a noise as of thunder. Not out at sea in the howling winds. Not in the crashing waves. The trees shake. The earth shudders. Branches fall. Neco falls to the ground and covers his face. When the noise stops, he looks up. A great serpent towers over him. It is thirty cubits long and its beard is more than two cubits in soft floating length. Its body is as a statue overlaid with gold and its color is that of true lazuli. The serpent coils itself before Neco, who hurriedly bows face down as if before a great prince. The serpent, in a voice like sweet metal striking metal, says, \"What has brought you, what has brought you, little one, what has brought you? If you say not speedily what has brought you to this isle, I will make you know yourself. As a flame you shall vanish, if you tell me not something I have not heard, or which I knew not, before you spoke.\" But before Neco can raise his head and say a word, the serpent takes Neco in its mouth and carries him to a cool shady spot beside a white lotus filled pool. Carefully as a cat with her kitten, the serpent lays Neco down on the green grass without a scratch. Neco checks his arms and legs, but they are whole and sound, and nothing is missing. Then the serpent says, \"What has brought you, what has brought you, little one, what has brought you to this isle which is in the sea, and of which the shores are in the midst of the waves?\" Neco bows face into the grass and replies, \"I was sailing to the mines by the order of Great Pharaoh, in the Great Horus in Flight, a ship one hundred and fifty cubits was its length, and the width of it forty cubits. It had one hundred and fifty sailors of the best of Egypt, who had seen heaven and earth, and the hearts of whom were stronger than lions. They said that the wind would not be contrary, or that there would be none. A storm came upon us while we were on the sea. Hardly could we reach to the shore when the wind came yet greater. As for me, I seized a piece of wood, while those who were in the boat perished without one being left with me for three days. Behold me now before you, for I was brought to this isle by a wave of the sea.\" The serpent says, \"Fear not, fear not, little one, and make not your face sad. If you have come to me, it is the gods who have let you live.\" And at this, the great serpent slowly winks one great yellow eye, \"For surely it is they who have brought you to this isle of blest souls, where nothing is lacking, and which is filled with all good things.\" The great serpent coils on itself and rests its great head upon the grass, \"Converse is pleasing, and he who tastes of it passes over his misery. As for you, if you are strong, and if your heart waits patiently, you shall return to your house which is full of all good things, you shall see your land, where you shall dwell in the midst of your kindred.\" Neco bows in obeisance. Touching the ground before the serpent, \"When that comes to pass, I shall tell of you to all who will listen. I shall make known your greatness, and I will return and bring to you sacred oils and perfumes and incense of the temples with which all gods are honored.\" The great serpent smiles in its long beard and says, \"I know that you are a poor sailor. You are not rich in perfumes. As for me, I am a prince of the land of Punt reborn as a serpent as you see. When you depart from this place, I will give you gifts that will turn your Great Pharaoh sweet to you. When you shall depart from this place, you shall never more see this isle. It shall be changed into waves. Now then let us speak of our homes that are far away.\" The serpent tells Neco of its seventy-five children, who once dwelt with it in the far off land of Punt. Of houses on stilts and fat queens and plump baboons. Neco speaks of Mara brewing beer sweet with broom and bitter with hops. He speaks of Kirti leaping from rocks to fly. He speaks of Sepu with his tooth and youths-lock. The serpent tells Neco the story of Se-Osiris, the child magician who journeyed with his father to the land of the dead. Neco tells the serpent the tale of the wise judge and the donkey. Stars wink on Dark Nuit's skin as she arches over her husband Cackling Geb, the earth. Gentle Hathor's moon sets into the trees. Neco, curling in a nest of the serpent's long beard, sleeps. In the morning, Mighty Ra is reborn and the man and the serpent sit and converse by the lotus pool. The days go by. Weeks. Months. And in the third month, the wind stops. The black cloudy sky clears its expression and smiles. Mighty Ra in his ship sails over clear green waters lapping in his light. And in the fourth month, the dark curve of a ship slips into view. Neco calls out to the men on the ship. The men call back and wave. It is the Heron. Neco turns to the great serpent, but it is gone. In the hollow where it coiled, there are chests of ebony. The chests are full of incense and perfume. They are full of lazuli and ivory and gold. Neco laughs and the men of the Heron swim to shore. He tells them of the Great Horus in Flight. Of the island. Of the weeping woman. Of the serpent with its gifts. They tell him how they came to sail to this island. They had been fishing when the black clouds gathered. They had been gathering their nets when the black waves rose. They could only cling to the Heron and let the wind carry them. As they despaired, a mighty serpent of the sea took hold of the Heron in its mouth. A great serpent took hold of them, but far from devouring the Heron, it carried the boat to a sheltered cove lined with caves. These three months, they sheltered in the rock. Sheltered in the kind dark earth as balls of solid water the size of a man's head fell from the sky. As the wind knocked trees and rocks like chaff. They sheltered until the sky smiled again. Set sail to where the wind would take them. The wind has brought them here. They fill the Heron's hold with Neco's treasure and sail away from the island. Neco glances back, but the island is not there. There are only waves. But it seems that from beneath that blue wave, a yellow eye winks and then slips from view. The wind is good. It blows in the direction that the men need to go. They sail west. They follow Mighty Ra as he sails across the sky. Great Pharaoh Khenmet-Amen Hatshepsut is in his tomb. The offering lights are lit. Everything is in its place. The year count is reset to year one. Debts are forgiven. Prisoners are released. Everything is as it should be. Great Pharaoh of Upper and Lower Egypt, Kheperkare, Son of Ra, Sanakhte is in his city of a thousand gates. The brown Nile rises to spread black wealth. Serpent eyed Amathaunta sleeps in her seas. Mighty Ra sails his golden ship past white clouds, which dot the vast blue sky. It is good. Neco is at sea. He is sailing home. Into the harbor of Kosseir, past the white breakwater, the drummer beats his drum and the men sing as the wind carries them home. They jump from the Heron to the white stone dock, throwing ropes and laughing. Laughing they carry Neco's treasure to shore. Their families are gathered. Mara and Kirti and Sepu stand on the white stone dock. There are hugs and it seems that Kirti is not too big to fly.",

    "text": "\"Having bathed their wounded in the hot springs near Smyrna, called 'The Baths of Agamemnon'...\" (Robert Graves, The Greek Myths, 160.y) It was a cool night, and torch-gilded steam coiled up from the milky water. The steam was kind: it veiled the warriors' scars, their bloody limbs, their bruises and their grief. There were girls somewhere. Odysseus could hear their high, clear voices, and the voices of men making them laugh and shriek. It was not a solace that interested him. He sat naked, chest-deep in warm, stinking water, and stretched his legs in front of him. The pool he had chosen was so small that his feet touched the bare rock of the opposite wall. A muscle in his calf spasmed and he leant forward to massage it. The water lapped comfortingly against his skin, like a hound. The torch crackled and flickered. A footstep on the path behind him made him twist in the warm, opaque water. He cursed as the boar-scar on his thigh twinged. A young man walked slowly along the edge of the pool, dark eyes fixed on Odysseus. He was naked except for the steam that drifted around him, and his long red hair glimmered like copper in the unsteady torchlight. A bracelet of red gold, no brighter than his hair, circled his wrist. Odysseus had watched the others, in pairs and groups and singly, walk along the sanded path towards the larger pools below. Ajax had called to him to join them, but he'd only smiled. He had wanted to be alone, to think of the comrades who'd fallen in battle. Too many dead, and they had yet to find a pilot who could set a course for Troy. Now Achilles halted beside the pool. He said nothing. He stood, invulnerably naked, and stared at Odysseus. Odysseus met his gaze. He was weary already of challenges. He did not bother to drink in the sight of pale, steam-pearled skin or the elegant curve of torso and hip. Achilles was smiling slightly. His thumb rubbed over the fox-head terminus of the bracelet on his left wrist, over and over, like a caress. His penis, already half-hard, stirred in the dark curls at his groin. The boar-scar on Odysseus' thigh flared like a call to arms. He leant his head back on the pool's rocky sill, still looking at Achilles. \"Your cousin Patroclus,\" he said, \"passed by a while ago. He asked if I had seen you.\" Achilles' eyes glittered in the flickering light. There was something almost insolent in his broadening smile. Odysseus might have surged up out of the pool and wrestled that smile from his face, or put a different smile there. He was not foolish enough, any more, to be confident of how such a bout would end. Achilles' stance provoked action. His hand fell from the bracelet to rub slowly across a dark bruise on his ribs. \"What if I'd rather bathe with you?\" he said, leaving space between the words for Odysseus to fill. Odysseus shrugged. \"I don't mind,\" he said, grateful to the cloudy water that hid his body's contrary response. The stroking hand stilled. \"You don't want... You are sending me away?\" \"I am weary after the battle,\" said Odysseus. \"Your cousin will be a better companion.\" \"You grow old,\" said Achilles, without affection. Odysseus gave him a level look. \"Old enough to rule my passions, as any must who would grow old.\" He remembered prophecies, but did not speak of them. For a moment it almost seemed that Achilles would speak of passion, seek solace, come to rest quietly beside him in the blood-warm water. It almost seemed that they might desire the same things. Then Achilles smiled at him suddenly, gloriously bright in the last sputtering flare of the torch. \"I'll leave you in peace,\" he said. \"They'll be missing me.\" The torch died, and the night crowded in around them. Odysseus sat in the dark and watched the shimmer of Achilles' back until the night veiled it. The warm water lapped at the day's aches. It numbed the edge of arousal that Achilles had left behind him. \"He won't grow old,\" he said aloud to the night. -end-",

    "text": "Pyrrha's bracelet was triple-stranded red gold, with termini like wolf-heads. Fox-heads. To Achilles it seemed something like a fetter, something like a trophy. He wore it always, because it was also a taunt. ---:-:-:--- Odysseus had heaped silver and gold and jewels on a gaudy carpet in the middle of the hall, telling the women to choose what they would. Jewelled torcs, delicate earrings, ivory combs: the magpie-girls fell upon them, cooing, as if they were no more than river-polished stones. Pyrrha stayed in the shadows near the wall. There were armed men at the door, so it would imprudent to leave. She had no wish to draw attention to herself. Odysseus' blue gaze passed over her again, like a feather brushing her skin. The best place of concealment is in full sight: so Pyrrha pulled the scarf straight on her hair, and went forward to kneel and be jostled by the girls. A red-gold bracelet, glinting torchlight as it was cast aside, was simple enough to please her. She pushed it closed around her wrist, afraid her choice had been too swift. And what was that, shining silver? A mirror? She reached for it anyway, and her hand met Larissa's. Let her have it... but Larissa shrieked, turning an accusing eye on Pyrrha even as she raised her bleeding finger to her mouth. The girls exclaimed: one ran to find water and bandages, and the others clustered around the victim. Pyrrha saw that it was a small cut, and might not even scar. She turned her gaze to the weapon that had dealt the wound. The knife was silver-bladed with an enamelled hilt. It was no longer than her hand (though Pyrrha's hands were large) and perfectly balanced for throwing. She tossed it and caught it, twice, before she looked more closely at the enamelling and saw the fish-and-net motif. Pyrrha looked up, and met Odysseus' sea-blue gaze, closing on her like a trap. The look she returned him was full of hatred: but he beckoned, and she followed. He was a king, and she merely the princess' handmaiden. There was no point in resisting him. Not then. Not in front of the still-distracted girls, and the older men with Odysseus, laughing together as they looked at her. Pyrrha held her head high and followed her captor. * * * A heavy striped curtain over the doorway to the guestroom was their only privacy. Two of Odysseus' household -- she did not recognise them -- stood sentry beyond that curtain. There would be no interruption, but they would hear every word. \"You make a pretty enough girl,\" said Odysseus thoughtfully. He circled Pyrrha, looking her up and down as though she were a slave at market. Yellow linen chiton, belted with blue cord: finer yellow linen, fringed and knotted, over her bright hair: a red-gold bracelet aching on her wrist with its unfamiliar weight. \"I am not pretty!\" Pyrrha said. On another girl's lips, it might have sounded bitter. Her voice was dark and smooth like polished wood. \"Hmm. Have it as you will. Perhaps you're right: the jaw is too strong.\" A single straight vertical line appeared between Pyrrha's savagely-plucked eyebrows. \"Unfeminine temper, too.\" Odysseus smiled indulgently. \"If you have something to say to me, my lord, I wish you would say it.\" Pyrrha gazed at the pale leaves painted on the wall. Her disdain was palpable, like a shield. Odysseus stood behind her, and his warm breath stirred the hairs on her nape. \"Your name is not Pyrrha.\" \"And if it's not?\" \"You make a pretty girl,\" said Odysseus again, mockery stronger now. \"Are you grown soft, to play the girl so easily?\" \"If I lie down for you as a girl should, will you leave me be?\" snapped Pyrrha. Her pale skin flushed with annoyance. \"You speak as though you could choose to walk away.\" The tension in Pyrrha's shoulders was unmistakeable. \"Pretty, painted lips,\" said Odysseus. Perhaps the desire in his voice was another trap. \"What would you have from me?\" demanded Pyrrha, sharp-voiced. Odysseus moved to stand in front of her again. Her broad hands clenched and relaxed. \"Come away with us. You are needed.\" Pyrrha met Odysseus' gaze for the first time. Her eyes were ocean-blue, like his. She shook her head. \"Why will you not?\" demanded Odysseus. He raised his hand, reached for Pyrrha's shoulder. Her hand shot up and closed around his wrist, faster than a snake, stronger than a woman. \"I said no.\" Odysseus shook his head, but he was smiling, and there was triumph in it. He let his hand lie in her grasp. \"I know you, Achilles. You may end the pretence.\" That blue stare, like a statue's painted eyes, met his. Not ashamed or guilty or flinching. Angry at discovery. Angry at him. \"Troy will not fall without your aid,\" Odysseus said softly, hearing the plea in his own voice. \"I care nothing for Troy. Why should I?\" Odysseus shrugged. \"Of course, if you prefer to play the girl...\" He let his eyes linger on Pyrrha's, Achilles', red-tinted mouth. He thought of a girl's painted lips on his skin, a boy's hard limbs pinned under him, and did not try to hide his body's response. The corner of Pyrrha's mouth twitched, he was sure of it. She -- he said nothing. \"I told them you could not resist,\" he added, goading. \"Do you expect me to congratulate you?\" Achilles was laughing at him. He was sure of it. It was not the response he had wanted. His wrist came free from the younger man's loosening grasp, and his hand finished its journey to Achilles' shoulder. There was hard muscle beneath the fine yellow linen: no need for gentleness. He did not kiss Pyrrha the way he would kiss his wife, or the way he would kiss a girl, or a pretty boy: some other pretty boy. Pyrrha, Achilles, returned the kiss as though it were a contest, twisting closer to wrap sinewy arms around Odysseus. It was not, quite, a wrestling hold. Odysseus grinned against Achilles' soft mouth, and kissed him back as though victory were already declared. He felt his captive's hand slide beneath linen to his skin. There were sword-callouses, still, on the palm. Then, appallingly fast, the kiss was broken. Odysseus was crashing backward onto solid stone. Hot-eyed Achilles followed him down, lithe as a dancer, and his hand pillowed Odysseus' head before it cracked against the floor. The little enamelled knife was in his left hand. Odysseus had ordered the sentries to stay on the other side of the curtain: but there was an alarmed enquiry. \"All's well,\" he called back, almost sure that Achilles would not harm him. Almost sure. The knife was not at his throat, nor -- more appropriate, perhaps -- against his groin. He lay quiet, gauging the tension of the body above him. \"Soft, you said?\" Achilles' breath tickled his neck. \"I asked.\" Their proximity left little doubt. Pyrrha was athletic, the slender frame as wiry as any youth who went daily to weapons-practice and the wrestling court. And Achilles had reacted to the kiss as wholeheartedly as to the threat he perceived. His erection pressed against Odysseus' own, though for the moment neither man allowed himself further response. \"I would not have it said that you forced me to accompany you. That you dragged me kicking, screaming, wailing like a maiden from the comforts of court.\" \"I would not force you to anything.\" He stared up at Achilles, fighting the smile that might doom him. \"My honour bids me to Troy.\" The enamel on the knife-hilt reflected amber lamplight. A lock of dark red hair escaped the linen. With a girl, Odysseus would have stroked it back into place, and let his hands travel further over her body. He did not move. \"And my manhood bids me prove myself still a man,\" Achilles added after a long, pregnant moment. Laughter glittered in his eyes. He stretched deliberately against Odysseus to set the knife aside, almost out of reach. Odysseus pulled the younger man down against him, and Achilles allowed it. That second kiss was sweet with complicity, sharp with the tang of blood from a bitten lip. Achilles' skin was hot and smooth under Odysseus' rough scarred hands, hotter and less smooth than a girl's. Each touch was like a burning brand. They twisted together on the flagstones like snakes, and their breath grew uneven. After a while, Odysseus braced and rolled and got the other man underneath him, grinning crazily. His lips were red with kissing now. Their tint was lost, smeared on Odysseus' mouth and throat. Odysseus began to untie the blue corded belt. His fingers faltered on the knot when a broad hand, well manicured, covered his. Achilles was frowning again. He said softly, \"I'd prove my manhood to you.\" His arms tensed in Odysseus' grasp, ready to reverse their positions once more. Odysseus, poised above him, said nothing. That he was older was obvious and irrelevant. He wanted to submit, to surrender to this painted boy, this prophesied warrior hiding in yellow linen. He was alarmed at the strength of that desire. It had been years... \"This is the way to bring him to you,\" said someone clearly, so clearly that he thought for a moment that someone else had entered the room. The sentries would not let a woman pass unquestioned, not even a queen, though from her tone she could be nothing else. There was no flicker of recognition or of anger in Achilles' eyes, no sign that he heard or that he saw anyone. They were alone. None to see disguise stripped away, none to see Odysseus obey this puppy's whim. None save Pyrrha, Odysseus thought, and smiled to think of a woman looking out through those darkening eyes. All this struck like lighting, in an instant. Then Achilles writhed from under him and pulled him to his feet, seized his shoulders for another kiss, wrestled him around until his shoulders met the wall, ungently, and Achilles' teeth in the soft flesh above his collarbone made him gasp and arch against the other man. Submission was not in his nature, and twisting his hands in that long red hair he drew Achilles' head gradually, implacably, down his body. Achilles' hands were deft with clasps and ties, and his mouth was wicked on Odysseus' revealed skin. He traced wet circles around each swelling nipple, teeth teasing before he bit. When his tongue tasted the clear, thick fluid oozing from Odysseus' straining erection -- wine-dark against his pale palm -- Odysseus dragged one hand free to brace himself against the wall, to stop himself from pressing the shapes of his hands into Achilles' skull as he thrust into the dazzling heat of that mouth. There was hair caught between the fingers of his free hand. He felt it tickle as he reached again to Achilles, stroking the curve of his jaw almost tenderly even as Achilles swallowed him ever deeper, hot and slick and clenching around him as lightning started at the base of his spine and he gasped, convulsed, folding forward over Achilles' strong curved back as the fire consumed him, as he heard Achilles gag and swallow and gasp. Eventually he could stand straight again, breath even. Some wicked impulse made him speak: \"You use your mouth like -\" Achilles' mouth, strongly flavoured with musk and salt and almonds, fastened over his like a lamprey. Again, the echo making it like a dream, he was falling slowly to the stone floor, hand pillowing his head and keeping him close in the kiss. Achilles sucked the breath from his mouth, and he was too dizzy to resist: sucked the will to resist from his bones, so that he turned and lay, limbs flung wide, hot cheek against the cold stone and yellow linen under his hips. Achilles' hair slid like a girl's against his nape: Achilles' unhesitating hands, nothing like a girl's, wet with saliva and semen, stroking him and opening him. What he felt was too diffuse, too double-edged, to be pain. His body remembered how this went, and he pushed back against the invasion, feeling the pulse in Achilles' burning shaft where it pressed against the skin inside his thigh. Achilles licked, slow and deliberate, from the hollow beneath his ear to the crease where his arm met his shoulder: and then bit, hard enough to draw blood, hard enough that Odysseus choked on an inhalation, and gulped in air as Achilles sheathed himself in one long hot glide. The rhythm of his thrusts sent Odysseus back to the edge of the abyss. He struggled to read the flickering shadows on the wall: the black shape of Achilles rearing above him, head back and long hair wild. A hand snaked beneath their joined bodies to seize his swiftly-hardening flesh as Achilles drove into him relentlessly, his other hand pulling Odysseus back against him so that each stroke seemed to strike more deeply. For a moment the sheer wrongness of it unanchored him from his body: he was letting this boy take him, this long-haired beardless youth with painted eyes... no. There was nothing girlish about the hard body against his, interlocked with his, forcing him to awareness of every point of contact. Odysseus felt the muscles inside him clench and spasm, and Achilles groaned against his shoulder where it was tender from the bite. The rhythm was changing, harder and faster and deeper, rough enough that he'd ache tomorrow but driving him to delirium with the barely-restrained strength in each thrust, with the wicked twist at the end of each stroke and the matched beat of the hand sliding on his own hardness and the sloppy groaning kiss stinging against the broken skin on his shoulder, with the way the sweating skin on Achilles' hard chest slipped and sucked against his back. With every fiery point of the constellation in which they touched. The constellation blazed agonisingly bright, and fell into ashes. * * * Outside, the sentries were whispering to each other. Achilles scowled, and raised an eyebrow at Odysseus sprawled beside him. Odysseus shrugged. \"Let them talk. They won't noise it around.\" \"They had better not,\" said Achilles darkly. There was no trace of demure Pyrrha now. \"What would they say? They saw nothing. They heard little enough. They don't know who... This is between us.\" He stared at Achilles, without whom Troy would not fall, until Achilles met his gaze. These two were gods' playthings, and knew it: there was scarcely anything to be said, even between them. They dressed in silence, and if they looked at one another's bodies, that was no more than men might do at the bath-house or the brothel. If their breath caught, it was weariness at the end of a long day, or the thought of a long and bloody war to come. Only, turning to leave, Achilles -- Pyrrha -- looked back, and touched the bracelet on her wrist. \"May I keep this?\" \"Of course,\" said Odysseus: and because Achilles was young still, he bit his lip and did not say, \"and what will you give me?\" Young men should not be bound: young men should not regret. ---:-:-:--- Pyrrha's bracelet was triple-stranded red gold: fox-head termini forced wide apart by the broad bones of Odysseus' wrist. The metal had been corpse-cold when he took it from Achilles' wrist, and the delicate fox-mouths had been caked with blood. Over the years of voyage the gold has worn smooth and bright again. He wears it always, though it looks too delicate for a warrior-king with whitening hair. It's a keepsake that reminds him of a girl named Pyrrha, who should not be forgotten. It's a relic of a gentler age, before violence and desecration and death. Before Troy. ~fin~",

      "A red-gold bracelet, glinting torchlight as it was cast aside, was simple enough to please her.",
      "She pushed it closed around her wrist, afraid her choice had been too swift.",
      "And what was that, shining silver?",
      "A mirror?",
      "She reached for it anyway, and her hand met Larissa's.",
      "Let her have it...",
      "but Larissa shrieked, turning an accusing eye on Pyrrha even as she raised her bleeding finger to her mouth.",
      "The girls exclaimed: one ran to find water and bandages, and the others clustered around the victim.",
      "Pyrrha saw that it was a small cut, and might not even scar.",
      "She turned her gaze to the weapon that had dealt the wound.",
      "The knife was silver-bladed with an enamelled hilt.",
      "It was no longer than her hand (though Pyrrha's hands were large) and perfectly balanced for throwing.",
      "She tossed it and caught it, twice, before she looked more closely at the enamelling and saw the fish-and-net motif.",
      "Pyrrha looked up, and met Odysseus' sea-blue gaze, closing on her like a trap.",
      "The look she returned him was full of hatred: but he beckoned, and she followed.",
      "He was a king, and she merely the princess' handmaiden.",
      "There was no point in resisting him.",
      "Not then.",
      "Not in front of the still-distracted girls, and the older men with Odysseus, laughing together as they looked at her.",
      "Pyrrha held her head high and followed her captor.",
      "*",
      "* * A heavy striped curtain over the doorway to the guestroom was their only privacy.",
      "Two of Odysseus' household -- she did not recognise them -- stood sentry beyond that curtain.",
      "There would be no interruption, but they would hear every word.",
      "\"You make a pretty enough girl,\" said Odysseus thoughtfully.",
      "He circled Pyrrha, looking her up and down as though she were a slave at market.",
      "Yellow linen chiton, belted with blue cord: finer yellow linen, fringed and knotted, over her bright hair: a red-gold bracelet aching on her wrist with its unfamiliar weight.",
      "\"I am not pretty!\"",
      "Pyrrha said.",
      "On another girl's lips, it might have sounded bitter.",
      "Her voice was dark and smooth like polished wood.",
      "\"Hmm.",
      "Have it as you will.",
      "Perhaps you're right: the jaw is too strong.\"",
      "A single straight vertical line appeared between Pyrrha's savagely-plucked eyebrows.",
      "\"Unfeminine temper, too.\"",
      "Odysseus smiled indulgently.",
      "\"If you have something to say to me, my lord, I wish you would say it.\"",
      "Pyrrha gazed at the pale leaves painted on the wall.",
      "Her disdain was palpable, like a shield.",
      "Odysseus stood behind her, and his warm breath stirred the hairs on her nape.",
      "\"Your name is not Pyrrha.\"",
      "\"And if it's not?\"",
      "\"You make a pretty girl,\" said Odysseus again, mockery stronger now.",
      "\"Are you grown soft, to play the girl so easily?\"",
      "\"If I lie down for you as a girl should, will you leave me be?\" snapped Pyrrha.",
      "Her pale skin flushed with annoyance.",
      "\"You speak as though you could choose to walk away.\"",
      "The tension in Pyrrha's shoulders was unmistakeable.",
      "\"Pretty, painted lips,\" said Odysseus.",
      "Perhaps the desire in his voice was another trap.",
      "\"What would you have from me?\" demanded Pyrrha, sharp-voiced.",
      "Odysseus moved to stand in front of her again.",
      "Her broad hands clenched and relaxed.",
      "\"Come away with us.",
      "You are needed.\"",
      "Pyrrha met Odysseus' gaze for the first time.",
      "Her eyes were ocean-blue, like his.",
      "She shook her head.",
      "\"Why will you not?\" demanded Odysseus.",
      "He raised his hand, reached for Pyrrha's shoulder.",
      "Her hand shot up and closed around his wrist, faster than a snake, stronger than a woman.",
      "\"I said no.\"",
      "Odysseus shook his head, but he was smiling, and there was triumph in it.",
      "He let his hand lie in her grasp.",
      "\"I know you, Achilles.",
      "You may end the pretence.\"",
      "That blue stare, like a statue's painted eyes, met his.",
      "Not ashamed or guilty or flinching.",
      "Angry at discovery.",
      "Angry at him.",
      "\"Troy will not fall without your aid,\" Odysseus said softly, hearing the plea in his own voice.",
      "\"I care nothing for Troy.",
      "Why should I?\" Odysseus shrugged.",
      "\"Of course, if you prefer to play the girl...\" He let his eyes linger on Pyrrha's, Achilles', red-tinted mouth.",
      "He thought of a girl's painted lips on his skin, a boy's hard limbs pinned under him, and did not try to hide his body's response.",
      "The corner of Pyrrha's mouth twitched, he was sure of it.",
      "She -- he said nothing.",
      "\"I told them you could not resist,\" he added, goading.",
      "\"Do you expect me to congratulate you?\" Achilles was laughing at him.",
      "He was sure of it.",
      "It was not the response he had wanted.",
      "His wrist came free from the younger man's loosening grasp, and his hand finished its journey to Achilles' shoulder.",
      "There was hard muscle beneath the fine yellow linen: no need for gentleness.",
      "He did not kiss Pyrrha the way he would kiss his wife, or the way he would kiss a girl, or a pretty boy: some other pretty boy.",
      "Pyrrha, Achilles, returned the kiss as though it were a contest, twisting closer to wrap sinewy arms around Odysseus.",
      "It was not, quite, a wrestling hold.",
      "Odysseus grinned against Achilles' soft mouth, and kissed him back as though victory were already declared.",
      "He felt his captive's hand slide beneath linen to his skin.",
      "There were sword-callouses, still, on the palm.",
      "Then, appallingly fast, the kiss was broken.",
      "Odysseus was crashing backward onto solid stone.",
      "Hot-eyed Achilles followed him down, lithe as a dancer, and his hand pillowed Odysseus' head before it cracked against the floor.",
      "The little enamelled knife was in his left hand.",
      "Odysseus had ordered the sentries to stay on the other side of the curtain: but there was an alarmed enquiry.",
      "\"All's well,\" he called back, almost sure that Achilles would not harm him.",
      "Almost sure.",
      "The knife was not at his throat, nor -- more appropriate, perhaps -- against his groin.",
      "He lay quiet, gauging the tension of the body above him.",
      "\"Soft, you said?\" Achilles' breath tickled his neck.",
      "\"I asked.\"",
      "Their proximity left little doubt.",
      "Pyrrha was athletic, the slender frame as wiry as any youth who went daily to weapons-practice and the wrestling court.",
      "And Achilles had reacted to the kiss as wholeheartedly as to the threat he perceived.",
      "His erection pressed against Odysseus' own, though for the moment neither man allowed himself further response.",
      "\"I would not have it said that you forced me to accompany you.",
      "That you dragged me kicking, screaming, wailing like a maiden from the comforts of court.\"",
      "\"I would not force you to anything.\"",
      "He stared up at Achilles, fighting the smile that might doom him.",
      "\"My honour bids me to Troy.\"",
      "The enamel on the knife-hilt reflected amber lamplight.",
      "A lock of dark red hair escaped the linen.",
      "With a girl, Odysseus would have stroked it back into place, and let his hands travel further over her body.",
      "He did not move.",
      "\"And my manhood bids me prove myself still a man,\" Achilles added after a long, pregnant moment.",
      "Laughter glittered in his eyes.",
      "He stretched deliberately against Odysseus to set the knife aside, almost out of reach.",
      "Odysseus pulled the younger man down against him, and Achilles allowed it.",
      "That second kiss was sweet with complicity, sharp with the tang of blood from a bitten lip.",
      "Achilles' skin was hot and smooth under Odysseus' rough scarred hands, hotter and less smooth than a girl's.",
      "Each touch was like a burning brand.",
      "They twisted together on the flagstones like snakes, and their breath grew uneven.",
      "After a while, Odysseus braced and rolled and got the other man underneath him, grinning crazily.",
      "His lips were red with kissing now.",
      "Their tint was lost, smeared on Odysseus' mouth and throat.",
      "Odysseus began to untie the blue corded belt.",
      "His fingers faltered on the knot when a broad hand, well manicured, covered his.",
      "Achilles was frowning again.",
      "He said softly, \"I'd prove my manhood to you.\"",
      "His arms tensed in Odysseus' grasp, ready to reverse their positions once more.",
      "Odysseus, poised above him, said nothing.",
      "That he was older was obvious and irrelevant.",
      "He wanted to submit, to surrender to this painted boy, this prophesied warrior hiding in yellow linen.",
      "He was alarmed at the strength of that desire.",
      "It had been years...",
      "\"This is the way to bring him to you,\" said someone clearly, so clearly that he thought for a moment that someone else had entered the room.",
      "The sentries would not let a woman pass unquestioned, not even a queen, though from her tone she could be nothing else.",
      "There was no flicker of recognition or of anger in Achilles' eyes, no sign that he heard or that he saw anyone.",
      "They were alone.",
      "None to see disguise stripped away, none to see Odysseus obey this puppy's whim.",
      "None save Pyrrha, Odysseus thought, and smiled to think of a woman looking out through those darkening eyes.",
      "All this struck like lighting, in an instant.",
      "Then Achilles writhed from under him and pulled him to his feet, seized his shoulders for another kiss, wrestled him around until his shoulders met the wall, ungently, and Achilles' teeth in the soft flesh above his collarbone made him gasp and arch against the other man.",
      "Submission was not in his nature, and twisting his hands in that long red hair he drew Achilles' head gradually, implacably, down his body.",
      "Achilles' hands were deft with clasps and ties, and his mouth was wicked on Odysseus' revealed skin.",
      "He traced wet circles around each swelling nipple, teeth teasing before he bit.",
      "When his tongue tasted the clear, thick fluid oozing from Odysseus' straining erection -- wine-dark against his pale palm -- Odysseus dragged one hand free to brace himself against the wall, to stop himself from pressing the shapes of his hands into Achilles' skull as he thrust into the dazzling heat of that mouth.",
      "There was hair caught between the fingers of his free hand.",
      "He felt it tickle as he reached again to Achilles, stroking the curve of his jaw almost tenderly even as Achilles swallowed him ever deeper, hot and slick and clenching around him as lightning started at the base of his spine and he gasped, convulsed, folding forward over Achilles' strong curved back as the fire consumed him, as he heard Achilles gag and swallow and gasp.",
      "Eventually he could stand straight again, breath even.",
      "Some wicked impulse made him speak: \"You use your mouth like -\" Achilles' mouth, strongly flavoured with musk and salt and almonds, fastened over his like a lamprey.",
      "Again, the echo making it like a dream, he was falling slowly to the stone floor, hand pillowing his head and keeping him close in the kiss.",
      "Achilles sucked the breath from his mouth, and he was too dizzy to resist: sucked the will to resist from his bones, so that he turned and lay, limbs flung wide, hot cheek against the cold stone and yellow linen under his hips.",
      "Achilles' hair slid like a girl's against his nape: Achilles' unhesitating hands, nothing like a girl's, wet with saliva and semen, stroking him and opening him.",
      "What he felt was too diffuse, too double-edged, to be pain.",
      "His body remembered how this went, and he pushed back against the invasion, feeling the pulse in Achilles' burning shaft where it pressed against the skin inside his thigh.",
      "Achilles licked, slow and deliberate, from the hollow beneath his ear to the crease where his arm met his shoulder: and then bit, hard enough to draw blood, hard enough that Odysseus choked on an inhalation, and gulped in air as Achilles sheathed himself in one long hot glide.",
      "The rhythm of his thrusts sent Odysseus back to the edge of the abyss.",
      "He struggled to read the flickering shadows on the wall: the black shape of Achilles rearing above him, head back and long hair wild.",
      "A hand snaked beneath their joined bodies to seize his swiftly-hardening flesh as Achilles drove into him relentlessly, his other hand pulling Odysseus back against him so that each stroke seemed to strike more deeply.",
      "For a moment the sheer wrongness of it unanchored him from his body: he was letting this boy take him, this long-haired beardless youth with painted eyes... no.",
      "There was nothing girlish about the hard body against his, interlocked with his, forcing him to awareness of every point of contact.",
      "Odysseus felt the muscles inside him clench and spasm, and Achilles groaned against his shoulder where it was tender from the bite.",
      "The rhythm was changing, harder and faster and deeper, rough enough that he'd ache tomorrow but driving him to delirium with the barely-restrained strength in each thrust, with the wicked twist at the end of each stroke and the matched beat of the hand sliding on his own hardness and the sloppy groaning kiss stinging against the broken skin on his shoulder, with the way the sweating skin on Achilles' hard chest slipped and sucked against his back.",
      "With every fiery point of the constellation in which they touched.",
      "The constellation blazed agonisingly bright, and fell into ashes.",
      "*",
      "* * Outside, the sentries were whispering to each other.",
      "Achilles scowled, and raised an eyebrow at Odysseus sprawled beside him.",
      "Odysseus shrugged.",
      "\"Let them talk.",
      "They won't noise it around.\"",
      "\"They had better not,\" said Achilles darkly.",
      "There was no trace of demure Pyrrha now.",
      "\"What would they say?",
      "They saw nothing.",
      "They heard little enough.",
      "They don't know who...",
      "This is between us.\"",
      "He stared at Achilles, without whom Troy would not fall, until Achilles met his gaze.",
      "These two were gods' playthings, and knew it: there was scarcely anything to be said, even between them.",
      "They dressed in silence, and if they looked at one another's bodies, that was no more than men might do at the bath-house or the brothel.",
      "If their breath caught, it was weariness at the end of a long day, or the thought of a long and bloody war to come.",
      "Only, turning to leave, Achilles -- Pyrrha -- looked back, and touched the bracelet on her wrist.",
      "\"May I keep this?\"",
      "\"Of course,\" said Odysseus: and because Achilles was young still, he bit his lip and did not say, \"and what will you give me?\"",
      "Young men should not be bound: young men should not regret.",
      "---:-:-:--- Pyrrha's bracelet was triple-stranded red gold: fox-head termini forced wide apart by the broad bones of Odysseus' wrist.",
      "The metal had been corpse-cold when he took it from Achilles' wrist, and the delicate fox-mouths had been caked with blood.",
      "Over the years of voyage the gold has worn smooth and bright again.",
      "He wears it always, though it looks too delicate for a warrior-king with whitening hair.",
      "It's a keepsake that reminds him of a girl named Pyrrha, who should not be forgotten.",
      "It's a relic of a gentler age, before violence and desecration and death.",
      "Before Troy. ~fin~"

    "text": "It is quiet here. I am alone. Away from the sweet sighs of souls remembering their time under the sun. I know nothing of living under the sun. I have always lived in the twilight. It is cold here. Dark. Although, the walls give off their own light when I am happy. This place is mine and all that is in it belongs to me. I have known little of warmth, or laughter, or light. I suppose that is why I took her, laughing in that field. But we are not there yet. I have always done my duty. Done what is right and just. I have never chased after nymphs so that they had to become a tree or a reed to escape me. I have never been capricious. I do my job. I weigh the hearts of those that my nephew brings me. And by the weight of their deeds, I judge them. Oh, I have my assistants. Minos, Rhadamnthus and Aeacus. But the final responsibility is mine. I create the punishments for the guilty. That is easy really. People create their own Tartarus. I do my best to weave the Elysian fields. That is harder. What do I know of Paradise? My father ate me when I was a minute old. Not for me a mother's trick. Switching a baby for a rock. I think he knew. I mean, how could he not. A baby tastes nothing like a rock. Or least, so I imagine, never having had a child, much less eaten one. But I think father knew that mother had spirited Zeus away. I think that he knew that no matter what he did, we were meant to be. Not that that stopped him from eating us. One by one. Just as nothing could stop us from springing from his newly opened stomach, fully grown. Odd to think I spent my childhood in my father's stomach. Perhaps that is why I rule the underworld and not the sky. Then again the others were right there with me and it did not seem to change them. I hear that excuse a great deal actually. My father or my mother did not love me. The gods made me do it. I am not responsible. But that is not how I judge the dead and that is not how I am. I could not be my brother Poseidon, lord of the seas. Everything always changing. A 100 wives, a 1000 children. I need the earth. The steadiness. The dark. I just had not realized how much I longed for the light, shining in her hair. Where to begin. At the beginning, I suppose. But it is already too late for that. The middle then. I had been looking for something for some time, but I did not know it. I would visit my brother on Olympus and watch them pull away from me. Not that I am ugly. Unlike poor Hephaestus, I am not lame or crippled. But as they say, black hair, black eyes, black heart. It is just that I do not smile much. My humors are odd. I do not laugh or dance. I do not play a musical instrument, much less invent them. That is why I do not visit the other gods much. Why I never saw her before that day. I was going somewhere. I do not remember where. Odd, how I can remember other things so clearly. The sun was hot and bright and high. The dirt smelled rich and full, pregnant. The earth of my land never smells like that. I am told there were many women in that field. The sirens. Her handmaidens. Apparently, they were singing. I did not notice. She was away from the others, random blobs of women in white chitons. She ran across the field. Well, skipped really. There were flowers everywhere. Red, yellow, white. Her skin was sun kissed. I think you call it that. It shimmered with pollen and all the gold of the earth. Except all the gold of the earth is mine. And she was not. She ran towards me, or so it seemed. Towards the river really. She stopped to smell the flowers. Narcissus transformed for her pleasure. And I knew that all I had to do was take her, like all the other gods are forever doing. Everyone is doing it. That makes it right, right? It was as if a madness had seize me. As if I would accept that sort of reasoning from any mortal who came before me. But I was not thinking about that. I was watching her let the mud ooze between her toes. Feet that had never worn shoes. I watched her smell her flowers, revel in my nephew's light. As I reveled in her light. Watching her watch the world through eyes green for growing things. So, I grabbed her. Easy as that. Drove forward with my golden chariot and my fine black horses. Reached over and picked her right up. Her skin was so soft. Like...would it be wrong to compare it to a peach? Cliched, I know and nevertheless true. She did not even have time to scream before the earth, my earth, the one that lies beneath nature, swallowed us up. Down. Away from the sun. She trembled in my arms. I tried to smile reassuringly at her. That is hard to do when you have just kidnapped someone that you do not quite know what to do with. Zeus would have known. Poseidon. Apollo. Pan. They are always doing that sort of thing. But as I have mentioned, I am not the sort to play those sorts of games. You only break things. We came to the Acheron, the river of woe. No wonder no one wants to come here. A little water splashed as I drove across the river. I do not need the boatman. I could see Charon's face as we crossed. He was surprised. And why not? I never bring women home. She jerked as the water hit her face. And she spoke. Her voice was low and soft and what did my goddess of the spring say, \"Take me back.\" And even though I was just beginning to realize just what I had done, all I could do was shake my head. There was nothing that I could think to say. Past the gates adamantine. Over the plains. We came to the gates of my home. My dog came to greet me, us. Three heads and three times the drool. He is just a great puppy really. He jumped on the side of the chariot. It swayed under his weight. He is quite large. She stiffened a little. And so my first words to my lady were, \"Do not worry, he will not hurt you.\" and to my dog, \"No boy. Down. Cerberus. No.\" And because he is mine and a good boy, he stopped. I let go of her then. Where was she going to go? She pulled away from me. Looked me straight in the eye. Why did I ever think green was a soft color. Rocks can be green too. \"Why have brought me here?\" and then a little lower. \"Take me back. My mother will be worrying.\" I did not have the words for what I wanted. It was too bald. Too stupid. Better to preserve the fantasy for a little bit. So instead I was cryptic, \"Follow me. I have something to show you.\" I started towards my gate. She did not follow. I gestured. \"Come on.\" One perfect brow arched. Just so, \"I'm not you're dog.\" \"No, he is too heavy to carry.\" and for some reason I smiled. I said I have an odd humor. I also said I do not smile much, but she brings out my smiles. \"True,\" she said. And she walked in front of me as if she were going to lead me into my own house. \"Well,\" she cocked her head to one side. The little wretch. Almost half my size. I smiled some more. Probably like an idiot. The gate opened to my touch. My house knows me. I led her down the great hall. Past the throne room where I weigh the souls of the dead. Past the portrait room with its pictures of my brothers and sisters. My mother. And, yes, my father. Down into the black tower's stair well. Each room lighting as I entered. Darkening as I left. We came to the door at the bottom of the stair. The door opened at my touch. We stepped into the room and the walls lit with the light of a thousand candles reflecting on my treasures. I am the god of the under earth. The god of wealth and gold and jewels. I have a great deal of treasure. I took her through my treasury. Past cups and rings. Scepters and crowns. Past things of gold and silver and bone, for I am a god of dead things too. Up a small dais to where I keep my best things. My favorite things. My helmet of invisibility, a gift from my nephew Hephaestus. A braided ring, made from my mother's black hair. My crystal through which I can see all the world, above or below. We stood there in the heart of my country, my city, my palace, my home. My heart. \"I am Hades.\" I said. It seemed like a good place to begin. She just stood there. So beautiful. So warm. \"I rule all of the under earth. The dead come to me when they die.\" She just stood there looking at me straight in the eyes. Waiting. No wonder. I was not making much sense. Perhaps, I should just get to it. I thought. Well, I was not actually thinking much. \"Be my Queen and all that I have, all that you see will be yours.\" As soon as I said it, I wished the words back. Too late. All wrong. Too quick. She kept looking at me. She was so small. So resolute. \"No.\" and then. \"Take me back now.\" Part of me knew that that was that. Story over. And part of me thought, \"Here she is in the center of my power and not afraid.\" I thought, \"Yes, of course. Forget I mentioned it.\" What I said, was \"No. Be my Queen. Rule at my side.\" She took a step back. \"You don't even know my name. You know nothing about me.\" \"True. What is your name?\" I tried not to sound desperate. Pathetic. Insane. Too late. \"No. You can't make me give you anything of me. Now take my back.\" Her hands clenched into fists. I think that she was more worried than she was letting on. But she did not stop looking at me in the eye. There are not many who can. Who will. \"There are no secrets from the dead, you know.\" She just shook her head. \"Follow me then.\" And when she hesitated. \"You are still smaller than my dog.\" She sighed and followed me. I took her back up the stairs. You do not think that I took her home do you? No, of course not. My mind was on fire for her. I say my mind because that is the way that I am. If it only took beauty to win me, well then dead Helen would be my Queen. So, I led her up to the top of the tower. To my room. As always, the door opened at my touch. She stepped through the door and stopped. I think it was the bed that got her attention. It got my attention. Definitely the bed. Again that resolute look. \"I'll fight you. I won't give in.\" \"No.\" I said and I left the room. I asked the door to lock. It almost did not know how. I went down to my stables. I pondered things that I could have said and done. Unsaid and undone. Too late. The straw made me think of her hair. If I were a proper god like Zeus or Poseidon, I felt that I would have been lying tangled in that hair right then. Of course, if I were a proper god, I would have married my sister and by that time have had numerous nymph and mortal and immortal concubines. I laid down in the straw. It smelled of growing things. It made me think of her. I slept a little Around midnight, Charon brought her to me. Wet and dripping. Cold. She shivered. I gave her my cloak. She had tied my sheets together and made a rope. Climbed out of my window. And since Charon has the only boat, she tried to swim the river of woe. She made it half way. Half way not far enough. She would not have drowned. Gods cannot drown really. But there are things at the bottom of the river. She was lucky that Charon saw her and brought her dripping to my stable. Hair flat around her head in clumps. Eyes red from the river. White and shivering in my cloak. Needless to say she was beautiful. As I have mentioned, I am strange. I am also, not one for words. I nodded my thanks to Charon and took her back to my room. This time, I locked the windows and went back to my stable. Now I should explain that I do have spare rooms. But they would have been a little too close to her room. My room. Anyway, the stable was nice. Warm. Full of horses and Cerberus, who loves me, wheezing through three mouths. The next morning, I went to her room. She was trying to pry open the window with my fruit knife. Then she tried to stab me. But it was my knife and it knew me. The knife jerked up and she lost her balance, hard. She glared up at me from the floor. \"Are you done?\" I asked. \"For now.\" She said. I held out my hand to her. She did not take it. She stood up on her own. \"Follow me then.\" and this time she did not argue. A step. Maybe. I knew that I was deluded. I did not care. We walked to the stable and then out one of the gates in my chariot. \"I don't suppose you are taking me home?\" she said. I just looked at her. \"Didn't think so.\" I drove out across the wide waste lands. Across meadows asphodel and out onto the Elysian fields. There the souls of the good wandered through yellow fields of wheat grass and late blooming flowers. The trees were red and gold. Occasionally a leaf would shiver from a tree and drift to earth. The air was full of sighs. The sky whirled with the glowing mist that is the roof of the underworld. I took her by the hand. Her hand in mine. Soft. I pulled her down from the chariot and into the field. I said, \"These are the Elysian fields.\" I waved at the people, the trees, the grass. \"Be my Queen and wander through your fields with the souls of the good.\" She looked around. \"Your flowers have no color. The grass is dead. The trees are going to sleep. My mother could do it better.\" Which meant her mother was Demeter, goddess of Nature. \"So show me how I am doing it wrong. Show me, show the deserving dead what Paradise should look like.\" She looked at me a moment. Looked at the quiet murmuring dead. She rubbed her cheek with one hand. She knelt down and picked up a bit of dirt. Let it fall through her fingers. Kissed one of the flowers. I wished I were a flower. But I have never been much good at that sort of metamorphosis. She was ignoring me. Concentrating. She ran her fingers across the tops of the grass. Then she reached up and pricked her finger on the broach of her chiton. A quick twist of the hand in the air and I could only watch as the color spread out from her in a wave. New grass grew amid the old. Pushing it away. Flowers grew lush and abundant. Even the trees bloomed white and pink and green. The air smelled full of life. \"It is beautiful.\" I said. \"It's still not right.\" she said. \"There's no sun in the sky. Just a sort of mist.\" She held her arms out into the light. It was pale on her skin. \"Growing things need the sun.\" She looked me in the eyes. Again. Always. \"I need the sun.\" She shook her head. \"Let me go. My mother can't make it spring without me.\" \"Be my Queen and make it spring here.\" \"No, they've lived their lives. I need to be with the living. In the light.\" I considered offering to make the sky brighter, but that seemed like a bad idea. So, we stood in my fields, her fields now and we walked a bit. We did not speak or laugh. We just walked. I day dreamed that she was my Queen. That we might kiss among the flowers. Wend grass through her hair. Dust our skin with pollen. We came to the river Lethe, where the souls gather on the banks, waiting. The trees here were still in winter. She had only performed a little magic and this is the center of my forest. The center of what this place is. What I am. Every now and then, one of the souls would step into the river. Duck under the cold icy water and as they rose again, with a long sigh, they would dissolve into the stream. \"What are they doing?\" she said. She sounded horrified. I wondered if she had ever seen ice or snow. \"They are going into the river Lethe to forget. That way they can be reborn. Clean. The ones that wait are not ready yet. \"So, the dead don't stay dead.\" \"Nothing stays the same. No one has to stay. No one has to come. Souls want order. Judgment. An afterlife. Even the souls in Tartarus can leave when they are finished with it.\" She smiled sadly. \"So, the only prisoner here is me.\" and she went back to the chariot and would not walk anymore. We went back to my house of gates and walls and spires. We stood in the courtyard and I looked down at her. Her chiton was very dirty now. I wanted, well, I wanted many things. But I wanted her to have the best. So, I took her to my store room, less grand than my treasury, but still large. One end was full of cloth. Wool and linen. Silk from Chin. Cotton from Araby. Colors solid and patterned. \"Pick whatever you would like.\" She shook her head, \"You can't buy me with a bit of cloth.\" \"No, but your chiton is the worse for your dip in my river.\" \"But the chiton is mine.\" I remember how I felt when she said that. Like a needle in the heart. I had my servants lay a great feast in my banquet room. All of my guests assembled. I always have guests. People always want something from the dead. I sat at the head of my table, with Springtime (I had taken to calling her that) at my side. I offered her the sweetest of wines, the savoriest of meats. But she would not eat a thing from my table. She knew that if she ate my food, she would have to stay. Now, I wish that at this point in the story that I could say that I only kept her for three days or seven or nine. That I soon let her go. But I did not. Every day I took her with me as I did my work. Every day I asked her to be my Queen. And every day she would look me straight in the eyes and say, \"No,\" and \"Take me home.\" She ran away. Got lost in the Elysian fields. Singed herself in the river of fire. Would not tell me her name. Refused all of my gifts. She took off her beauty and put it in a box. I did not know women could do that, but they can. She thought it would matter, but it did not. I loved the way she moved. The way she would rub her cheek with one hand when she was thinking. I loved the way she talked. The way her mind worked. Because she couldn't not talk. She would try. She would sit silent and resolute at my table. Walk quiet at my side. But then she would see something that interested or amused her. And she would ask questions or make comments. She would forget herself and then we would talk, sometimes for hours. Sometimes, she would begin to laugh and then she would remember. Be quiet and resolute again. I loved every minute of every moment that I spent with her. Which was part of the problem. Because I knew it was wrong. How could I not. And yet, I did not let her go. My servants fell in love with her also. She made every room that she was in more beautiful by being there. And although my servants were mine and would not, could not, say anything, they looked at me reproachfully for making Springtime sad. I took to wandering the halls of my home at night. I asked the rooms to remain dark as I walked. And because my house loved her too, I think it understood. I could not sleep for more than a few hours at a time. My face grew gaunt. You would have thought that I was the prisoner. But I was not and I knew it. After awhile, even the dead began to reproach me with their looks. They would come before me, starved and pale because Springtime's mother had taken the life from the world. Would not make the crops grow or the animals fecund. She kept the world above dark and cold. Wept rain and hail and snow. And the people were dying as mortals will when there is nothing to eat and the North wind is allowed to go where he wants. I told myself that it was not my fault. That I was not killing the world. That it was Demeter's choice to abandon her job. That I was doing my job. Sometimes, I would scry in my crystal and watch Demeter wander the world, searching. Watch the wind blow on a world that had never known winter, only spring and summer. It became harder and harder to judge the dead. How could I judge them when I knew myself to be guilty. How could I help the souls in Tartarus purge themselves, when I could not help myself. Although, I could have helped myself. I just did not want to. And time passed. And I knew that soon, let it be tomorrow, not today...that someday I would have to let her go. And then one day my nephew Hermes came to see me. Trickster when he was a day old. Thief. Messenger. The only one who visits me because he brings the souls of the dead to my kingdom. But this was not a visit. That day he had a message from my brother. The message said that Zeus, King of the Gods, Ruler of Olympus, Lord of the Sky and Air, Thunderbolt had decreed that I should release Persephone (her name was Persephone) daughter of Demeter. Or what, I wondered? He will throw thunderbolts at the dirt. He cannot reach me here. Perhaps, he will not invite me to family dinners? Go to war with me? I have my own armies and my defenses are vast. I know where the Titans are kept and I live closer to them than he does. For a moment, I imagined myself at the head of an army storming the gates of fair sunlit Olympus. For a moment, and then I looked in my nephew's eyes. My nephew who always smiles, who was not smiling. And I knew that I would not. In the end, even madmen must be true to their natures. I told him to wait in the room that I keep ready for him. For my house has many rooms and many guests. People always want things from the dead. That night I had a simple table set in a room that overlooks my garden. On it were simple foods: bread, cheese, water, seeds, and fruit. And I had her brought to me in her gray chiton that was once white. Her beauty in a box. Her cheeks pale for lack of the sun. And we ate in silence. Or rather, I ate and she watched. For she would never eat anything from my table. Never take any gift that I tried to give her. I looked at her. Memorizing her face, as if I could ever forget her. All the water in the Lethe would not be enough. The food was like lead in my stomach. So, I stopped eating, gathered my courage and began. I wish I could remember what it is that I said, but I cannot. The words tumbled out, one after the other. Burning my throat and eyes. I apologized. Not because I wanted her forgiveness, though I needed it in my bones, but because that is what the person that I am had to do. What is right. Just. Because it belonged to her, like her freedom, like her green eyes. My own black eyes were full and hot, but I did not take them off of her face. I gave her the ring, braided from my mother's hair. Not to wear as my Queen or wife, but because I wanted her to have it as a remembrance of her time beneath the earth. I hoped that because it was my mother's and not mine, that she would take it when she left. She held it in her hand. Turned it over and over. Looking at it. She rubbed her cheek with one hand, thinking. She put the ring on her index finger. It was dark on her hand. Then she let that hand drift through the bowl of seeds, around the lid of the flask of water, over the rough surface of the bread. She picked up a pomegranate and cut it open with my fruit knife. And she picked out six seeds. And then she looked me in the eyes and she ate them. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Now I am not a quick thinker. Slow and deliberate as the earth. So, you will have to forgive me if I say that I did not quite understand what she had done. She smiled at me, a little watery because she was also crying and all I could think was that she had smiled at me. She shook her head and said, \"Idiot.\" And then she came around the table and pulled me down. And then she kissed me. Butterfly kisses on my eyes. Pomegranate kisses on my mouth. I am afraid at that point, I could not think at all. Sometime later, we stopped. We were sitting. I do not remember sitting. She was in my lap. Her arms around my neck. A couple of strands of her long golden hair were caught in the wool of my tunic. I let them go. She put her hands on either side my head and said, \"Now you know that I have to leave. The world above is dying without me. It needs the spring. And I couldn't be me if I didn't do what's right.\" I nodded. If this was it, well it was certainly more than I deserved. And then she laughed at me, the imp. \"Don't be so solemn, lord of the dead. I'll come back. When the world has had its spring and summer, when I have seen my mother, then the world can have its fall and winter too.\" I did not really believe her. No one wants to come back, but I said, \"When you come return, Charon will ferry you to me. The doors will open at your touch. The lights will come on when you come into the room. And when, you leave, the lights will go out again.\" She cried a little more at that and we said a great many silly things like sweet, and love you, and forever. Then she got up and she cut off a lock of her hair with the fruit knife. And I took her down the stairs to where Hermes was waiting. I did not watch her leave. I went down to my treasury, the heart of my kingdom and wove her hair into a ring. And so I wait, as I wait every year. I can weigh the souls of the dead with an easy heart again because I know myself. I wear her ring on my finger and I sit in the dark and I wait. Sometimes, I see her at gatherings. But on Olympus, we do not speak. The light is too harsh and bright. It hurts my eyes. Instead I wait, as my kingdom waits. For the sound of her quick footsteps on the stair. For the golden flash of her hair. For the warm smell of her skin. For the soft feel of her touch. For the return of spring.",

      "I do not remember where.",
      "Odd, how I can remember other things so clearly.",

      "Red, yellow, white.",
      "Her skin was sun kissed.",

      "Towards the river really.",
      "She stopped to smell the flowers.",
      "Narcissus transformed for her pleasure.",
      "And I knew that all I had to do was take her, like all the other gods are forever doing.",
      "Everyone is doing it.",
      "That makes it right, right?",
      "It was as if a madness had seize me.",
      "As if I would accept that sort of reasoning from any mortal who came before me.",
      "But I was not thinking about that.",
      "I was watching her let the mud ooze between her toes.",
      "Feet that had never worn shoes.",

      "As I reveled in her light.",
      "Watching her watch the world through eyes green for growing things.",
      "So, I grabbed her.",
      "Easy as that.",

      "She did not even have time to scream before the earth, my earth, the one that lies beneath nature, swallowed us up.",
      "Down.",
      "Away from the sun.",
      "She trembled in my arms.",
      "I tried to smile reassuringly at her.",

      "Poseidon.",
      "Apollo.",
      "Pan.",
      "They are always doing that sort of thing.",
      "But as I have mentioned, I am not the sort to play those sorts of games.",
      "You only break things.",
      "We came to the Acheron, the river of woe.",
      "No wonder no one wants to come here.",
      "A little water splashed as I drove across the river.",
      "I do not need the boatman.",

      "And why not?",
      "I never bring women home.",
      "She jerked as the water hit her face.",
      "And she spoke.",
      "Her voice was low and soft and what did my goddess of the spring say, \"Take me back.\"",

      "It swayed under his weight.",
      "He is quite large.",
      "She stiffened a little.",
      "And so my first words to my lady were, \"Do not worry, he will not hurt you.\"",

      "No.\"",
      "And because he is mine and a good boy, he stopped.",

      "I did not have the words for what I wanted.",
      "It was too bald.",
      "Too stupid.",
      "Better to preserve the fantasy for a little bit.",

      "and for some reason I smiled.",
      "I said I have an odd humor.",
      "I also said I do not smile much, but she brings out my smiles.",
      "\"True,\" she said.",
      "And she walked in front of me as if she were going to lead me into my own house.",
      "\"Well,\" she cocked her head to one side.",
      "The little wretch.",

      "Gods cannot drown really.",

      "Hair flat around her head in clumps.",
      "Eyes red from the river.",
      "White and shivering in my cloak.",
      "Needless to say she was beautiful.",
      "As I have mentioned, I am strange.",
      "I am also, not one for words.",
      "I nodded my thanks to Charon and took her back to my room.",
      "This time, I locked the windows and went back to my stable.",
      "Now I should explain that I do have spare rooms.",
      "But they would have been a little too close to her room.",
      "My room.",
      "Anyway, the stable was nice.",
      "Warm.",
      "Full of horses and Cerberus, who loves me, wheezing through three mouths.",
      "The next morning, I went to her room.",
      "She was trying to pry open the window with my fruit knife.",
      "Then she tried to stab me.",

      "Her hand in mine.",
      "Soft.",

      "The grass is dead.",
      "The trees are going to sleep.",
      "My mother could do it better.\"",
      "Which meant her mother was Demeter, goddess of Nature.",
      "\"So show me how I am doing it wrong.",
      "Show me, show the deserving dead what Paradise should look like.\"",
      "She looked at me a moment.",

      "She was ignoring me.",
      "Concentrating.",
      "She ran her fingers across the tops of the grass.",
      "Then she reached up and pricked her finger on the broach of her chiton.",
      "A quick twist of the hand in the air and I could only watch as the color spread out from her in a wave.",
      "New grass grew amid the old.",
      "Pushing it away.",
      "Flowers grew lush and abundant.",

      "For my house has many rooms and many guests.",
      "People always want things from the dead.",
      "That night I had a simple table set in a room that overlooks my garden.",
      "On it were simple foods: bread, cheese, water, seeds, and fruit.",
      "And I had her brought to me in her gray chiton that was once white.",
      "Her beauty in a box.",
      "Her cheeks pale for lack of the sun.",
      "And we ate in silence.",
      "Or rather, I ate and she watched.",

      "Burning my throat and eyes.",
      "I apologized.",

      "What is right.",
      "Just.",
      "Because it belonged to her, like her freedom, like her green eyes.",
      "My own black eyes were full and hot, but I did not take them off of her face.",
      "I gave her the ring, braided from my mother's hair.",
      "Not to wear as my Queen or wife, but because I wanted her to have it as a remembrance of her time beneath the earth.",
      "I hoped that because it was my mother's and not mine, that she would take it when she left.",
      "She held it in her hand.",
      "Turned it over and over.",

      "She picked up a pomegranate and cut it open with my fruit knife.",
      "And she picked out six seeds.",

      "And then she kissed me.",

      "Pomegranate kisses on my mouth.",
      "I am afraid at that point, I could not think at all.",
      "Sometime later, we stopped.",
      "We were sitting.",
      "I do not remember sitting.",
      "She was in my lap.",
      "Her arms around my neck.",
      "A couple of strands of her long golden hair were caught in the wool of my tunic.",
      "I let them go.",

      "I nodded.",
      "If this was it, well it was certainly more than I deserved.",
      "And then she laughed at me, the imp.",
      "\"Don't be so solemn, lord of the dead.",
      "I'll come back.",
      "When the world has had its spring and summer, when I have seen my mother, then the world can have its fall and winter too.\"",
      "I did not really believe her.",
      "No one wants to come back, but I said, \"When you come return, Charon will ferry you to me.",
      "The doors will open at your touch.",
      "The lights will come on when you come into the room.",
      "And when, you leave, the lights will go out again.\"",
      "She cried a little more at that and we said a great many silly things like sweet, and love you, and forever.",
      "Then she got up and she cut off a lock of her hair with the fruit knife.",
      "And I took her down the stairs to where Hermes was waiting.",
      "I did not watch her leave.",
      "I went down to my treasury, the heart of my kingdom and wove her hair into a ring.",
      "And so I wait, as I wait every year.",
      "I can weigh the souls of the dead with an easy heart again because I know myself.",
      "I wear her ring on my finger and I sit in the dark and I wait.",

    "text": "There is a fair and fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled and there are ninety cities in it: the people speak many different languages which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans, Dorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. -Odyssey, Homer 1374 BCE: Beginnings and Promises Knossos Europa held her new-born baby next to her breast and sang to it, sometimes in her own Phoenician tongue, half-remembered songs of her childhood, sometimes in the alien tongue of the Cretans which she was quickly learning, in fragments and hesitant pieces... It didn't matter: it was the singing itself, not the words that were important. Asterius knelt by the bed, and offered a finger to their baby, smiling as it gripped it tightly. He then brushed a dark strand of hair away from his wife's brow and kissed her. \"Decided on a name, yet?\" he asked. She smiled back. \"I always knew the name I'd give him.\" She lifted the baby high and looked at it as if it was the sum of all her hopes. He was. He was also more than a hope, he was a certainty in many ways -- though the labour had been exhausting, she had never doubted that both she and the baby would be all right. After all, hadn't the god who had brought her to this island, and given them the divine gift of Talos promised her that? Wasn't he still watching over them? \"His name is Minos!\" she cried out in joy and thanks, for all to hear, men and gods. He was the first of that name to become king of Crete. But not the only one. 1314 BCE: Departures and Regrets Near Knossos The sphinx alighted near the building. The grey-haired man waiting near the entrance, looked up and smiled. \"I haven't seen you in a while, my lady.\" The sphinx cloaked her wings around her and simply looked at him silently for a moment. \"And you don't plan to ever see me again,\" she said softly. \"Oh, my lady...\" \"You are my friend, Hierax,\" the red griffin-woman insisted. \"My closest one now that my l...\" she fell silent for a moment and bit her lips. \"Do I have to lose my best friend so soon after losing my mate? Why do you go?\" Hierax sat heavily down. \"A number of reasons. Lycastus, for starters.\" \"Lycastus?!\" The sphinx-woman was incredulous. \"He wants you to stay almost as much as I do.\" He smiled bitterly. \"Yes. He almost ordered me to stay. But... I can't replace Minos, my lady. I'm neither Lycastus' father nor can I usurp his kingdom. He is old enough to deal with the grief of his father's death, and he is old enough to be king, even though he himself doubts it. But he mustn't have me around, or he'll trust me more than his own judgement.\" \"I don't believe you,\" she said flatly. \"I don't believe that's the reason. Why aren't you telling me the truth?!\" He neither replied nor looked at her for a long while. \"You are with egg,\" he said at last, changing the subject. Once again she bit her lips, but she nodded. \"You have a mate to mourn,\" he went on, standing up and looking in her eyes. \"Ten years from now, children to bring up. As for me, my lady...\" and his voice dropped to a whisper. \"It would be too difficult to be just your friend. Goodbye.\" He kissed her on the lips, once, briefly, while she stared wide-eyed. And then he left. His estates, the island, her life. But he left a covenant behind. It was his parting gift. 1278 BCE: Bonds and Friendships Knossos The girl was in the stables. On second thought, that's where he should have looked in the first place, mused Kalliphon. He walked to her side and started \"My princess--\" \"Have you ever seen such a majestic beast before?\" she interrupted, admiration in her voice. He looked at the bull she was indicating. \"It's a great animal, my lady. It reminds me of the herds of my hometown,\" he said at last. She gave him a strange look and her voice became more serious. \"What do you want, Kalliphon?\" \"Your father wanted me to tell you that it'll be a little while yet before he can attend the festivities. There has been an embassy from Egypt newly come and--\" \"And father has to listen to all their introductions and greetings and requests and messages. I know.\" She sighed then smiled again. \"He once told me that Egypt is the place of origin of the most boring ambassadors, you know. \" He smiled. \"Is that so, my lady?\" \"Besides Miletus and Phaestos.\" He frowned. \"Is that so, my lady?\" She ignored him. \"What message do you think they'll be bringing?\" Better to contribute something, he thought. \"My guess, princess, is that they bring the news of pharaoh Seti's demise and Ramesses' ascension to--\" The maiden interrupted in a loud voice. \"The new Horus, the good god Pharaoh Ramesses, wants it to be known throughout the foreign -no- throughout the barbarian lands of king Lycastus, that last year his father, good god Pharaoh Seti became the new Osiris. Something ornamented like that, don't you think?\" He sighed. \"I suppose so, my lady. I suppose so.\" \"Pharaoh Ramesses wants to inform you, my lord, of the death of his father. He greets you and extends his friendship.\" Lycastus was surprised. He had been expecting something more elaborate. And far more tiresome. And he'd also expected that the man wouldn't know their language and that a translating scribe would have also been brought along. He coughed and responded in a similarly plain manner. \"Crete wishes the best for the new Pharaoh and grieves for his father's death. Egypt's friendship is much valued by us.\" The messenger nodded grinning. He was a black-haired and black-bearded young man (he couldn't be much older than his twentieth year, Lycastus thought) but his eyes were bright and he had the kind of smile that truly looked genuine, rare though that seemed to be nowadays. The young man went on. \"My lord I'm not going to trouble you for very long, and only the first part of my message comes from the Pharaoh. The second part is a personal request from me.\" Lycastus raised an eyebrow. \"Go on with the message from the Pharaoh, friend. We'll have plenty of time to discuss whatever it is that you want.\" The messenger nodded again and began. The king listened. By the end he was smiling grimly and dismissing everyone except the Egyptian, he sent a servant to call Kalliphon. Kalliphon stepped into the throne room. \"Come in, Kalliphon,\" said the king. \"This,\" he added for the sake of the Egyptian, \"is Kalliphon of the Eteocretans, advisor to the ruler of Phaestos, and guest here.\" He turned towards Kalliphon again. \"This man has brought some interesting news.\" Kalliphon nodded towards the man. \"Yes, my lord?\" \"It seems that a couple weeks ago an Egyptian ship was attacked by pirates not far from the southern shores of Crete. It carried gold -- and one of the sons of Ramesses as well.\" Kalliphon tried to interject. \"My lord--\" The king continued. \"It all ended well fortunately. Two Cretan ships came to the aid of the Egyptians, and the pirates fled. Gold and other gifts of the Pharaoh as thanks have been unloaded in the haven of Phaestos.\" He nodded, smiling. \"The Eteocretans are proud to uphold the bond between Crete and Egypt.\" \"Too bad they didn't have the chance to prove it.\" He was puzzled. \"Lord?\" The king's face became rather harsher. \"Though it was in the south of Crete that the pirates attacked, it was not Eteocretan ships that provided the assistance. They named their captain to be Sarpedon of the Lycians.\" \"Yes, my lord.\" No emotion could be heard in his voice. \"So, though Rhadamanthys has already been informed, I also instruct that Phaestos besides arranging for the transfer of the gifts to Miletus you'll also double and redouble your efforts to cleanse the seas of pirates. The pirates seemed to know about the cargo of the ship -- probably they have made an arrangement with someone in Phaestos or the havens -- some trader perhaps.\" \"It will be done, lord. But may I ask something of our guest?\" \"As you wish.\" Kalliphon turned towards the black-haired man who throughout all this discussion had remained silent, smiling. \"Why make the extra journey and come all the way to Knossos? Surely you could have remained in Phaestos, said all this just to lord Rhadamanthys and be certain that he'd do everything required.\" The man's smile widened. \"Oh, there are two reasons I came here. The second is personal -- I wanted to come to Knossos for my own reasons. But the first reason is rather more simple.\" \"Yes?\" \"I didn't trust him.\" Lycastus nodded thoughtfully but made no comment on this. \"Go away, Kalliphon,\" he simply said. Kalliphon, furious but silent, left. Lycastus watched as Kalliphon departed then smiled as he turned again towards the messenger. \"Walk with me, friend, if you will,\" he said as he rose. There was a time for rudeness, and there was a time for good manners, and he was glad that the latter had arrived. His walk was slow but steady as it always was, and with the slow steps he let his thoughts drift as he led his guest through the palace. There were matters here that were of far greater importance that this man from Egypt could know. The pirates themselves were a small matter: they would most probably be wiped out or driven away before midsummer at the latest. But the rivalry between Sarpedon and Rhadamanthys, between Lycians and Eteocretans... May the gods give me more time... he prayed silently. But he couldn't count on the will of the gods. Not for this, nor for anything else. He mentally shook himself and turned his attention again to the Egyptian guest. Time for a possibly quite more joyful matter. \"You remind me of someone,\" he told the black-bearded man. \"A man whom I knew and admired, an advisor to my father forty or so years ago, when I was still a boy. His name was Hierax and he had the same... impudence in him as you do.\" He paused for a moment. \"And if I remember correctly the same ring as well,\" he added almost as an afterthought indicating the small golden piece of jewellery that the Egyptian was wearing. The man nodded. \"He was my grandfather, lord. He went to Egypt where he had earlier lived as well. His life ended there this last year. He wished me to send his good wishes to you; and I wanted to return to his estates here.\" Lycastus stopped walking and closed his eyes. \"So he's dead. I expected as much of course. He would be a very old man by now. \" He opened his eyes again. \"But you are staying?\" \"Yes, my lord. That was the second matter I wanted to bring before you.\" He laughed, shaking off the brief sadness. \"My friend, I admired Hierax -- and it gladdens my heart to see his grandson. Nor has my father's promise been forgotten -- your estates have been preserved. You'll be shown them tomorrow. But tonight you'll dine with us, and watch the festivities, of course. But you've not yet mentioned your name.\" The man smiled. \"You honour me with your hospitality, lord. My name is Minos.\" \"You were named after my grandfather?\" Pasiphae asked, passing the cup of wine to him. Minos smiled and drank from the cup. \"Something like that, my lady. Your family meant a lot to mine. Hierax never forgot his friendship with your grandfather, Minos, nor with Minos' parents.\" The sixteen-year old princess nodded. She was beautiful, Minos couldn't help but notice. Anymore than he could help noticing the number of men who throughout the festivities had tried to catch her attention. Fools all of them, really. She evidently had the beauty and the position that could attract a god. As her husband she would get nobody lesser than a king. And both Pasiphae and Lycastus couldn't possibly demand anyone less. \"So, what did you think of the sports, lord Minos? And what do you think of our land?\" said Lycastus. \"The bulls were magnificent, my lord. One bull-rider was even more so,\" he replied. Pasiphae grinned and made a mock-bow. Also smiling he went on: \"You can give him my compliments, lady,\" And was satisfied to see Pasiphae choke on her drink. Lycastus laughed heartily and slapped Minos on the back. \"If you wish to get along with my daughter, Minos, I advise you to never fail and praise her adequately for her accomplishments in bull-leaping.\" Pasiphae also smiled with a glint in her eyes. \"But if you want me to like you, never fail to tell me the truth.\" \"Then I'm glad that now I can do both at the same time,\" Minos said, giving back to Pasiphae his own cup. \"I've seen very few people with your skill in the sport.\" Pasiphae gave him a strange look, perhaps searching his words for honesty. At the end she simply shrugged, perhaps figuring out that since it was true that she was one of the best, he'd have no reason to lie no matter his intentions. Lycastus spoke again. \"And of the land?\" \"Well, I've just arrived in Crete a few days ago, my lord. But the land is fertile and the palaces both here and in Phaestos are magnificent. Everyone can see that it's a land that has been blessed by gods.\" Lycastus thoughtfully laid his cup down. \"Three gifts. Three special gifts the gods have given to this island.\" Minos nodded. \"I saw one of them from afar. Talos still patrols the shores as in the days of Asterius and your father.\" The king nodded. \"The second is the javelin-that-can't-miss. I'll have you see it as soon as we finish dining.\" Pasiphae gasped, and Minos couldn't help but also feel surprised. To show him one of Crete's greatest treasures, to him who just arrived there as guest... \"To say that you honour me is an understatement, lord.\" Lycastus ignored it. \"As for the third... every guest here knows of the greatness of Crete's herds.\" Minos gave a careful glance to the king. Lycastus seemed to be expecting something. A test of some kind? \"But at least we two also know of the grace and courage of Crete's daughters,\" he replied. The king smiled, his voice becoming even kinder than before. \"I thank Helius every day, for the gift of my daughter,\" he said slowly, looking at his daughter. Pasiphae squeezed his hand gently. Lycastus looked at her for a few moments then turned to Minos and lifted his cup. \"I'll drink to Hyperion Helius and the Gods for the gifts they have given us.\" Minos and Pasiphae also lifted their cups. \"To Crete's daughters,\" said Minos. Pasiphae smiled. \"And to her returning sons.\" \"He really likes you, you know,\" said Pasiphae, the next day, as they rode with a small escort for the old estates. \"I know,\" he replied simply. \"I never intended it, though.\" Pasiphae laughed. \"It's true!\" he objected. \"My goal was never to appeal to noblemen. I generally find it far more efficient to serve people who don't mind honesty.\" Pasiphae raised an eyebrow. \"I can't believe that Ramesses or his father would go for it.\" \"You'd be surprised,\" Minos mused. \"My father, Mehy, was a great friend of Seti. He didn't mind the honesty of friends. As for Ramesses...\" \"Yes?\" \"... why do you think he sent me away?\" Pasiphae stopped her horse startled. Minos likewise stopped. \"I read the letter that Ramesses sent to my father,\" she said. \"It said that the services of you and your father to Egypt were many and that Egypt was grateful for them. It certainly didn't seem like he was exiling you.\" Minos smiled. \"Ah... yes. But his real message was of course 'keep him, keep him, we don't want him.' Shall we go on, lady?\" Pasiphae, skeptical, spurred her horse onward. Minos and the guards followed. They all rode in silence for a while. \"What do you think of the gods, Minos?\" she said at last apropos of nothing. He was surprised. \"Why do you ask?\" \"Last night... Your name... My father's words...\" She shook her head. \"He truly considers me a gift of the Sun-god,\" she said finally, her voice more steady. \"My mother -- she lost two children, born prematurely or dead, before she had me. My parents went to pray in the temple of Helius and... Well, let's say they attributed my coming to him.\" She sighed. \"And then again there's the stories about my great-grandmother.\" \"Europa.\" \"Europa,\" she agreed. \"She came out of Phoenicia riding a great white bull -- they say it was a disguised god, perhaps even Zeus himself. And that her child, my grandfather, your namesake Minos, was not by Asterius, but by the king of the gods.\" \"And what do you believe, my lady?\" \"No,\" she said, \"what do you think, my lord? Am I a descendant of the gods?\" He was the one to stop his horse now. He thought for a moment, his gaze downcast. He finally raised his head again. \"My lady, please approach.\" She led her horse next to his. He smiled for a moment, then startled her as he suddenly leaned over and whispered in her ear. \"The gods are petty, my lady. The gods are small. For every Prometheus, how many Heras do we have? For every Athena, how many Areses?\" He sat back straight again and now spoke in a normal voice. \"I think you are fully human. I think that the sun-god has no idea you even exist. Take pride in that. Shall we go on?\" She hesitantly nodded. They rode in silence for the remainder of the journey. \"Away, intruders!\" The middle-aged balding man was bravely waving a spear at their direction. Pasiphae seemed surprised and the two guards moved forward ready to intervene. But Minos laughed it off. \"This is Pasiphae, old man. The daughter of the king, I'm sure you've heard.\" The man was undaunted. \"And these are the estates of Hierax under my care, by order of the king, as I'm sure you've heard. So only the king, or the gods, or Hierax himself can remove my guardianship.\" \"Or his heir, my man.\" He slowly removed his ring. \"I am his heir, Minos, son of Mehy, son of Hierax, and this ring is the arranged token as my grandfather said to yours when you were but a child.\" He threw it to him, a glint of gold tumbling in a high arc. The man caught it effortlessly, his expression still skeptical. Then he squinted down at the ring and saw the emblem inscribed on it -- a pyramid with a single Eye blazing out of its apex. He lowered the spear but didn't seem to relax. He stuttered briefly and seemed helpless as he looked around. Other people had started to gather by now and Pasiphae couldn't hold back her annoyance. \"My lord,\" she said addressed to Minos, but looking directly at the man, \"I am the princess of this land, and you the owner of these estates. If these slaves don't welcome you at once, I advise that we all return swiftly and bring my father's army to clear them away.\" She expected fear; she expected them to submit. What she did not expect was the cold anger that appeared on the man's face and his irresolution seeming to melt away as he half raised the spear again. And while she suddenly grew afraid she also couldn't help but be surprised at Minos' reaction: for as the guards once again moved forward, he turned towards them lightning fast with a glare. \"Leave,\" he said quietly but with a hint of menace. Minos spoke again. \"Leave. Your task was to ensure the lady's safety in the journey. Leave.\" She tried to interrupt. \"My lord--\" But Minos would have none of that. \"I'll ask, my lady, that you send your men away from these estates. You are invited to remain here, of course, as long as you wish.\" Pasiphae was silent in thought. He was not afraid...? She was intrigued. \"Tell my father that I'll return on my own,\" she said to the guards. \"Leave.\" After a few more objections they finally left and Pasiphae turned towards Minos again. \"My lord--\" Once again he interrupted her. \"These are not slaves,\" he commented gently, but the hardness of his eyes hadn't left. \"This is as much their home as mine, or more so, for decades now ever since their old lord gave them their freedom before departing.\" He turned now towards the gathering people, his voice loud. \"My ancestor made an agreement with you, did he not? You'll hold this land as long as you won't deny it. You'll get the help of his heirs, as long as you so accept it. His heirs will be worthy of trust, as long as you trust them. And this bond will hold, as long as you keep the other bond -- the one between this household and Hierax's old friends.\" The people now murmured among themselves in surprise, but the old man was still uncertain. Pasiphae prepared to speak again, when surprised once again she saw Minos get off the horse. He waved away the spear with a hand, and placed the other on the servant's shoulder. \"My friend, by your courage you've proven your bond still holds. The bond of my family stands as well. I've been a friend of the sphinxes all of my life.\" There was a sigh, a release: The tension melted away and the man lowered the spear. \"My apologies, lord. Come in, and join us eating.\" Four griffins were inside, their majestic forms captivated in their daytime stone forms. While eating, Pasiphae couldn't help but glance at them every so often. There were two larger males, one whose wavery hair seemed almost to surround him like a lion's mane, the other completely bald and both taller and thinner. There were also two children: One was what seemed to be a young girl (she can't be more than fourteen she estimated) seemingly frozen while laughing. On her shoulders an even younger boy (two? three?) was caught pulling a strand of the girl's hair. All of them had feathered wings, and hands and feet that seemed to be a cross between a lion's paws and human members. And all of them were completely naked. \"Creon did suggest, my lady,\" Minos whispered in her ear, \"that a piece of cloth be put over them but I said you wouldn't mind their nudity.\" To her horror she felt herself blushing. \"It's not that, my lord,\" she said quickly to remove the grin from his face. \"I was wondering about the people here. I'd never imagined...\" she waved her hands around vaguely. \"Aren't these people afraid?\" she whispered back to him. Minos shook his head. \"They were worried, my lady, that they'd fail their guests. That we'd hate the griffins and bring in the army to smash them. And that they'd fail thus of their bond.\" He emptied his cup and laid it aside. \"Sphinxes come in a hundred different forms -- and a thousand different names. In Egypt it's not sphinx but shesepankh, the living statue. Gryphon is properly the name for only those among them whose heads are eagle-like -- though it's often used for all. Up north they are harpies -- certainly not the kindest of names. Far better is the one they have among the Babylonians and the Hebrews: there they are the Cherubim. \"But they are all equally sphinxes, no matter the name or form. And sphinxes protect, my lady. Yet even more than that, they often need protection. My family has protected and been protected by sphinxes for centuries.\" Creon -- the man who had first met them -- sat down next to them. \"This is their clan's Second-in-command,\" he said indicating the one with the mane. \"The other is a mentor for their younger generations. It's a long story, but a couple of years ago the young boy was... lost and in danger. While the rest of the clan was searching for the child in the woods, the sphinx-girl had the idea to come and recruit our help instead. Obviously we eventually found him. Since then and every so often, some sphinxes come for visits -- though it's usually just the girl and a rookery brother of hers.\" \"Lady Pasiphae is anxious to talk to them, Creon,\" said Minos. She looked at him with a mixture of amazement and horror, and Creon turned his gaze towards her in obvious wonder and doubt. \"You are, my lady?\" Her surprise turned suddenly to anger. Did Minos and this servant think she'd be afraid of the sphinxes or any other monster? Was Minos making fun of her? \"Yes,\" she said looking directly at Minos, daring him to contradict her but Minos didn't react. \"Yes, I am. I've never talked to sphinxes before, and I look forward to it. You'll introduce them to me. What are their names?\" Creon hesitated. \"They don't have names of their own,\" he said at last. \"Call them Second, Teacher, Girl and Boy if you'd like. Or White, Grey, Golden and Blue. Or nothing at all.\" Minos finally spoke again. \"But not monsters. Of all their names that's the one they resent the most -- almost as much as the free resent being called slaves.\" Her anger vanished as fast as it had come. \"I'm sorry,\" she said and Creon nodded. \"She's not as bad as I first thought, my lord,\" Creon said a few hours later. \"She's uncomfortable but she's getting the hang of it.\" The wings of the sphinxes formed capes now which served adequately for decency and thus removed at least one problem. Pasiphae had timidly started talking with the young sphinx girl. \"No, she isn't,\" Minos agreed full-heartedly. \"She's a bit arrogant, but not spoiled. She's... hard, but not cruel, not in the slightest. It's not too late for her to learn.\" Creon moved away and Minos was left with his thoughts. It had been a good two days, he thought, and couldn't help but smile. He had already made friends of the king and his daughter, enemies of a lord, renewed the alliance with this household and with the griffins. He looked on as Boy now pulled with a fierce yank the long hair of Pasiphae, who startled gave off a short scream, lost her balance and fell down before she laughed realising what had happened. And he had also helped a princess start getting over her petty, if few, prejudices. Yes, it was a good two days indeed. He was home. 1275 BCE: Coming of Age Near Knossos Minos slowly walked to the top of the hill, the grey monstrosity of a hound running and yapping playfully by his side. Laelaps (that was the name that Creon had given to the strange beast), was the only sphinx-hound to his knowledge which remained flesh throughout the day. Neither Creon nor any of the sphinxes knew how that happened or why -- they hypothesised that the beast might be in part divine. Reaching the top, Minos sat down on the grass (with barely a glance at the statue by his side) and waited patiently watching the sun go lower and lower on the horizon. When it set, he heard a great roar beside him as Golden awoke. \"Uh, where was I? Oh, yes. And Coeranus said that I have a talent for magic, can you believe it?! And that if I want he can teach me magic, and then I'd be able to, to...\" the excited griffin-girl floundered for a moment then regrouped: \"... to do anything I want. Can you believe it?!\" Minos coughed to hide his smile. \"I can believe it. What are you going to do?\" Swiftly Golden plopped herself next to Minos and held her chin in her hands, her face becoming troubled. \"Eh... I don't know. I mean I'll have to spend more time on the city, which means less time with my clan, and less time free for hunting or fishing (why can't Coeranus live in the mountains anyway? I asked but he said no) and less time--\" \"--less time spent with that cute griffin-boy I constantly see you with.\" Golden blushed for a moment but wouldn't let herself be stopped. \"Eh, yeah that too. And I'll have to learn how to read, (and what's the need for that I don't know), and Coeranus tells me that he won't have me around naked so if I want to learn magic I'll have to wear clothes, can you believe it?\" Minos laughed loud. He didn't know the new magician very well and hadn't trusted his motives. He was a bit more relieved now -- hardly completely assured but a bit more so than earlier. \"I'd follow his advice if I were you,\" he said still laughing. \"How many times have I told you myself to start wearing the clothes I gave you? I don't like the way some of the folk here are looking at you, especially when they think that I or Creon can't see them.\" \"But they are so uncomfortable when I'm flying! And as if I couldn't rip out any of their organs and beat them to death with it! And besides, you have never looked at me that way.\" He simply smiled now. \"You are too young for me.\" Her expression turned to mock-anger. \"Hey, I'm twenty-eight years old! I'm older than you!\" Minos replied in mock-exasperation. \"Half of which you spent as a statue, I must remind you. They don't count, I might add. And you are a restless fourteen-year old who never imagined herself as a witch.\" Golden became rather more serious -- a rare event for her. \"So... what do you think I should do?\" He sighed. \"Magic can't do everything, you know. It doesn't bring joy, it doesn't bring success, it doesn't bring love. It doesn't preclude them, but it doesn't bring them either.\" \"I know,\" she said but seemed not to believe it entirely. \"Beyond that I can tell you little more. Magic can bring knowledge, sometimes. And some small power perhaps. Decide by yourself. But don't get far from your clan, and certainly not from that boy. Mating season only one year away, you know.\" She blushed even more strongly than before but this time found nothing to say -- an even more rare occurrence. Minos smiled roguishly. \"And try out some of those clothes. Now, scram. I think there's someone coming.\" She nodded, still orange from embarrassment, and glided away from the hill, Laelaps following her along the ground. Soon afterwards a messenger arrived, the light of the torch illuminating his face. \"Yes?\" \"My lord Minos, \" he said out of breath. \"I come from Knossos. King Lycastus.... King Lycastus died suddenly less than an hour ago.\" Less than a minute later Minos was on his chariot and speeding for the city. Xenia, an old servant woman with a plump figure and steel grey hair, was expecting him when he arrived, leaning casually on a pillar. \"She knew you'd come,\" she said. \"And so did I.\" \"How could I not?\" he said as he stepped off the chariot. \"Where is she?\" \"In her chambers. But she won't see you. She told me to tell you.\" With a groan he tried to step past her but she grabbed his arm and held him with unexpected force. She leaned toward his ear and whispered furiously. \"I know you love her. And I know she loves you. But you won't help. You can't help. She needs to be alone. It's who she is.\" He stared at her in silent wrath for a moment and she stared back. He was the first one to break away with a long breath. His shoulders sagged. She nodded and her voice was more kind now. \"She'll want to see you at her own time and then you'll have to be close by. I'll show you to your room, my lord.\" Despite his sympathy for Pasiphae's grief and his own sorrow for Lycastus's death, he managed a thin smile. Xenia had already served two kings but both of them had only ruled the realm that extended from the palace walls outwards. Inside them it was she who was absolute ruler by force of personality and long habit alone. He nodded and they walked inside and through the long corridors and many rooms. \"How did he die, Xenia?\" She sighed. \"His heart gave out soon into the banquet. As always, he poured out the first of the wine to the gods -- but soon afterwards he clutched his arm and fell. None of the doctors could save him.\" He stopped walking. Could it be? Xenia gave him a puzzled look. \"Lord?\" He looked at her startled out of his thoughts. \"Thank you, Xenia, but I think I'll wander for a while. I'll ask you if I need anything,\" then left her. His steps took him to the banquet room. Servants had already picked up the cups and the dishes. He swore under his breath, even though he should have known that this would have certainly been done. \"I know what you are thinking,\" said a man from the shadows. Minos hadn't noticed him earlier. \"I thought it immediately myself.\" \"And?\" Daedalus shrugged indifferently. \"No way to tell. The food was harmless, I gave from it to a dog and it's still healthy. Same with the wineskin. That leaves the cup itself but he had drained it and no strange scent remained -- if one had ever existed. But that's not conclusive of course.\" Daedalus thought for a moment then mused speaking more to himself now. \"Pasiphae sat on the right of the king; but I think we can exclude her from our suspicions. On his left was the mother of Sarpedon, Laodamia, and next to her the advisor to Rhadamanthys. The magician was further away on the right. Various minor lords were around but I don't recollect their exact positions. But of course you know how cups are handed around in such feasts. It makes a poisoning more risky and more safe at the same time. Funny that.\" Minos sat down wearily but didn't speak. He should be pleased that his inventor friend had covered all the bases but instead felt rather annoyed; and not with the inconclusiveness of his search. It was the indifference in the man. For Daedalus this, as everything else, was just a puzzle to be solved, an idea that he followed and researched as any other. For him there was no possible murderer to be found, no victim to be mourned. The inventor spoke again. \"So, there will be a new king. There aren't that many choices.\" \"None of which appeals to me,\" groaned Minos. Daedalus lifted an eyebrow but then simply shrugged again. \"So, what are you going to do?\" Minos lowered his head. And thought. And he could see the city -- this city of cities -- being built in a few seconds. Quick as lightning, tiny as ants, the men and women built and stored and gave birth and died, again and again and again and again, but the white-walled city remained, and beyond it other cities grew, and beyond them other kingdoms. And he thought, \"Once more they will pass. But I shall remain. I should have never loved them.\" And he wept. Rhadamanthys, lord of the Eteocretans, awoke. He sat up and brushed his long hair away from his eyes. The day must have dawned hours ago but it was still dark outside due to the clouds and the storm that was gathering. He had dreamt but he couldn't remember the details -- he almost never did. Almost all that remained were half-remembered images and emotions: first unconcerned joy and then great grief; and then determination and contentment and passion and sadness again and joy and sadness and sadness and-- --and the willing sacrifice of the Divine Bull. He shuddered and it wasn't because of the bitter cold. He got up and dressed himself then walked into the garden, outside. Kalliphon was waiting there and the first thing Rhadamanthys felt was relief. He valued his advisor greatly and dreaded the idea of having to judge the many cases brought before him every day without him by his side. The second thing he felt was surprise. \"I thought you'd spend a couple more days in Knossos, my friend.\" Kalliphon shook the head. \"I could do no more good there. Both Lycastus and Pasiphae would prefer you to promote your goal yourself.\" \"No luck convincing Lycastus to give me his daughter, then?\" \"None.\" Rhadamanthys thought. \"And you advise that I go there myself.\" He didn't like the idea very much. \"That's your decision to make, my lord.\" \"You will come along, I trust,\" he said hopefully. \"If you wish, my lord. But you'll have to choose someone to rule Phaestos in your stead.\" He casually waved a hand, indifferent. \"Choose someone yourself. You make all the right choices.\" He thought for a moment. \"We'll head out tomorrow morning. I'll manage to convince Lycastus somehow to give me his daughter.\" \"He's dead.\" Rhadamanthys stopped dead on his tracks. \"What?!\" he said stunned and turned around. Kalliphon had vanished. \"He's dead,\" whispered the wind and the world collapsed around him. Rhadamanthys, lord of the Eteocretans, awoke. It was still the middle of the night and a tempest was out in earnest. Under the light of a lightning he saw a falcon that had perched on the window and was now looking at him curiously. He rolled his legs out of the bed and unsuccessfully tried to untangle his muddled thoughts when a servant rushed in and stopped as he saw his lord already awake. \"Yes?\" he snapped. \"My lord, a messenger has come from Knossos. King Lycastus is dead.\" Rhadamanthys shuddered. The falcon flew away. Sarpedon, lord of the Lycians, slept. There was once an unimportant cave in an insignificant mountain on an unremarkable island. That was the very reason it had been chosen. Secretly, quietly they had started arriving in many different shapes. The old woman welcomed them -- some she bid into the cave so as to help the pregnant goddess -- others she asked to remain outside. \"Are you sure you are strong enough to do this? Only recently you gave birth to Three,\" the old woman -- a goddess herself, Sarpedon suddenly realised -- asked a newcomer. The girl -- Sarpedon had never before seen a more beautiful woman -- nodded. Her skin was pale but her long hair was darker than Night itself and her black eyes were stars. \"Aset was my sister-in-the-soul. I'll help avenge her murderer. I'm strong enough.\" The old woman's eyes fell on the even younger boy -- no more than ten, thought Sarpedon -- that was holding the girl's hand. The boy stared back angrily. \"And she was my best friend.\" A smile full of sadness. \"She used to call me insufferable. I won't be left out.\" \"How many have gathered, Grandmother? Are we enough?\" asked the girl. Another woman stepped suddenly from the cave and suddenly both the girl and the boy felt joy as they recognised her by the single feather on her hair. \"Metis!\" \"We are enough,\" the goddess of truth and wisdom said and smiled. \"And we must begin.\" They all held hands, Metis and the dark-haired boy and the beautiful girl and the old woman and all the others who had come for this occasion. And they danced. Round and round they went, round the cave, round the mountain, with loud music and singing voices and the beat of bare feet against grass and rock. But besides the music and the voices, beyond what mortal senses could perceive, they all wove their magic, magic which would be believed insignificant -- believed to be the reasonable excess magic which was the outcome of any such festivity. But which would serve to hide the magic that was taking place inside, to cover up the birth of Zeus. Sarpedon opened his eyes as the captain of the ship shook him gently. \"We are entering the haven of Miletus, lord,\" said the captain. Sarpedon rose and shakily went to the prow. He could feel there was something wrong here. He was certain about it but couldn't put it into words. \"Father... what's going on?\" he whispered. And his dream... it hadn't been a dream, he was certain of it. As he stepped off the ship he saw his mother awaiting him on the dock. And looking at her he somehow knew what was wrong. \"I understand now. It wasn't a dream. But this is one.\" The image of his mother looked surprised but nodded. \"Are you ready to be a king?\" she -it- asked. Sarpedon looked at her. \"I think so,\" he said at last. \"Why do you ask?\" She folded her arms and spoke without emotion. \"King Lycastus is dead.\" He stared for a moment. \"How?\" The shade ignored him. \"What are you going to do?\" He thought for a while, then shrugged. \"I hadn't expected to be doing this for another couple of years. But I'll vie for the kingship of course.\" The world vanished. Sarpedon woke up -- he knew it was for real this time. A falcon was watching him and he stared at it intently until it decided to leave, out of embarrassment perhaps. \"How far from Miletus, captain?\" he asked. \"Less than half an hour.\" Sarpedon nodded. And shivered. There was something going on here and he didn't like it. He'd find out what it was, though. He'd find out. Minos didn't sleep that night. Daylight found him staring outside his window in contemplation. He didn't turn as the door opened and closed behind him. Pasiphae hugged him softly from behind and leaned her head against him. He kissed gently one of her hands, then lifted her off her feet and placed her on the room's bed. He kneeled by its side. \"Have you slept at all?\" he asked her. She shook her head weakly. \"No. I couldn't. I didn't want to, anyway.\" He found nothing to say except... \"I am sorry.\" Her voice was but a whisper. \"Make love to me.\" He kissed her on the forehead then shook his head. \"No. Today it'd feel as if I was using you.\" Suddenly she grew furious and grabbing a pillow swung it around and hit him wildly time and again with it. \"I would be using you, you courteous fool!\" He tried to stop her gently and succeeded to get a hold on her hands but only for Pasiphae to yank on him and pull him onto the bed as well. He smiled softly and looked at her. \"Then I wouldn't be used that way. Not even by you. Not even today,\" he said as he wiped off Pasiphae's tears with the back of his hand. She turned towards him. Her next words shocked him. \"I'll never marry you,\" she said softly. Minos just stared for a moment. \"What?\" She gulped. \"Sarpedon or Rhadamanthys. You knew those were the choices all along.\" He grew furious. \"For the kingdom! Not for you.\" 'It... it doesn't matter. It's good for the kingdom that the chosen king be in the family of the kings.\" He couldn't believe his ears. She went on relentlessly. \"Whoever is chosen by the assembly of the lords, to him... to him I'll offer myself in marriage.\" He turned his face away. She whispered. \"Please don't hate me. Eteocretans and Lycians, Pelasgians and Achaeans and Cydonians. There has to be peace. Balance. My father knew that.\" \"Your father!! Your father supported me. He wanted us to get married.\" She closed her eyes. \"And I wish we had done so, earlier. If so you would have become king by now. But it's too late now.\" \"So, you'll ignore both your heart and your father's wishes.\" It seemed like a bad joke. She stared back at him. \"Yes. For the good of the kingdom. Neither his nor my own wishes matter.\" He looked at her in silence. Oh, my poor princess, he thought, I knew that you were hard. But I never guessed how much. \"Make love to me,\" she repeated. Her voice was steadier this time. He looked into her eyes. I could do it. I could let myself use and be used. He kissed her deeply and she closed her eyes savouring the taste of his lips. When she opened them again he had already left. Silently she wept. \"Where are you going?\" Xenia had shouted at him as he rode the chariot away. \"Away!\" he had simply shouted over his shoulder, and indeed that was his only thought at the moment. He didn't know where he was going and that had been rare for him. Or, depending on how you looked at it, way too common. And now, he had found himself before yet another palace. He stepped lightly off the chariot. After wavering for a moment, he walked in. He knew of course what this place was, as did all of Knossos and possibly all of Crete. It was the first palace, a palace far older and at one time far grander and more beautiful than the one he had just fled from. And, like the civilisation that had built it, it had seen far better days. Crete had once been mighty, in some ways surpassing even the splendour of Kemet. Not in armies of course: surrounded by the wide sea it had rarely needed to defend itself against invaders, and even more rarely had desired to invade others. Wealth would be a rather closer comparison -- a wealth gained through commerce for in those times Crete had ruled all the seas all the way north to Troy and east to Phoenicia and south to the delta of the Nile. But what had been the glory of Crete was its joy. (He lightly passed his hand over the wall where had been drawn an image that made him smile -- two young children, a boy and a girl, boxing, each with one hand gloved, one bare. Such sports were the mark of the Cretans.) It had been a land of artists and athletes and builders. And in the midst of a whole realm of light, the palace had been the brightest place in it all, the kingdom's centre and symbol. The Deluge, now centuries past, had killed thousands. It had demolished the land with earthquakes, it had drowned her with tidal waves, it had caused her to starve when it covered her with volcanic ash. He snorted. That catastrophe had been nothing compared to what he considered the worst disaster of them all. The Argives. Great Mother, how he hated the Argives! Compared to the Cretans, Tectamus and his fellow invaders had been nothing but a horde of uneducated savages, a warrior civilisation with no knowledge of beauty except where they had learned from the Cretans themselves. But nonetheless they came and they killed and they burned. And the palace, this mighty palace of the labyrinthine passages and the wall-to-wall paintings and the architecture that astounded even Daedalus, they turned into a symbol of slavery. That had been the beginning of the end though it would not be for many decades more that the island would be rocked by Asterius' rebellion and the palace would be burned down, an event that the Cretans would celebrate for a long time. They had a right to do so. It was the fall of the symbol of tyranny. And alongside it the fall of the symbol of Old Crete. He knew he was getting dismal all over again, but for the moment he didn't care. Asterius proved a far more worthy and gentle king than his father, of course. He treated Achaeans and natives equally and indeed he was considered by many to be more Cretan than Argive. He united the island once again and managed to hold his own against further invasions. As for his own namesake, Asterius' son, Minos, he was a figure to be respected once more throughout the seas. A figure to be respected... as the Argive ruler of a land filled with Argives of course. It was a lost cause. It didn't matter that Crete was strong once more, for its inhabitants were no longer the same. Even Rhadamanthys and Kalliphon, so proudly bearing the name Eteocretan, \"true\" Cretan, never even considered the possibility that Pasiphae could rule by herself, Priestess and Queen, and that her husband should be nothing more than an advisor, normally would be nothing more than a consort. He leaned heavily against a pillar. He would leave; he had to leave. Pasiphae didn't want him, this island didn't want him, this was now an Achaean place filled with as much strife as Mycenae or Tiryns, marriage served politics and poisons ruled, and kings were murdered so that others replaced them, and he... He suddenly opened his eyes wide and stood straight. What a fool he had been. What a fool she had been. A sweet fool. \"Oh, my princess...\" His eyes took in the room he had just wandered into. The throne room. How fitting. He walked across the room and touched the stone chair. And then he sat. His eyes glinted and his mouth twisted into a hawkish smile. Pasiphae had been afraid that were he to marry her and thus claim the throne, he would be quickly murdered. Perhaps she was afraid that he would be quickly murdered even if she remained unwed and he stayed on the island at all, a dangerous candidate to be removed. He would show her, show the island that he feared neither Rhadamanthys nor Sarpedon. And if that was what it took to have her as wife, he would become a king on his own. And he would make Crete great again. His smile failed for a moment. There would be a price, a personal price, to pay. And it wouldn't be small. But he had rarely been a creature of long plans. That was later, and he would deal with it at the time. \"Will I ever see him again?\" she asked when Xenia walked into the room. She was not crying anymore. \"Do you even doubt it? Even I know him better than that. Do you think he'll just give up?\" \"He didn't even want to make love to me,\" she mumbled, more to herself than to Xenia. Xenia smiled with pity. Xenia had seen Pasiphae grow from childhood into maturity. After the queen's death it was she who had spoken to a young girl concerning the ways of women -- to a young woman concerning the ways of men. And in turn Pasiphae had confided everything to her, her dreams, her desires -- even when her mother was alive that happened and nowadays she didn't even realise she was doing it. For that trust, even if for nothing else, Xenia loved her. And now her princess -- her child really -- was being loveably dense. \"You wanted him for tonight and for never again. You wanted a memory. He wants the whole of you.\" Pasiphae's eyes narrowed. \"He can't have me!\" Xenia sighed. He walked over and touched Pasiphae in the shoulder. The girl shuddered at the touch and her eyes glittered with unshed tears. \"How long will I mourn for my father?\" she said -- her voice trembled. Xenia smiled bitterly. \"For the rest of your life. But it will get better.\" \"And for Minos -- how long will I grieve for him?\" She tilted her head. \"You haven't lost him.\" \"Yes, I have.\" \"You hav--\" \"Better away than dead,\" she mumbled. Ah. Now she understood the child. It did make a kind of twisted sense, especially in times like these. You are proud, my daughter. You are strong. And you blame yourself. You will make a great Queen. And a lousy wife. Minos himself doesn't know what he's getting into. She smiled with the thought. \"He doesn't need your protection, child.\" \"He'll go away. He'll leave -- he has friends everywhere. Let him go back to Egypt, or Colchis or the Phoenicians or the Maryandynians or Athens or whatever other place he has or hasn't visited already. Just not here.\" \"Child... I know people. And Minos deserves every bit of his name. He'll stay. \" Pasiphae's temper flared briefly. \"And what do you know about me, Xenia?\" But it was a silly anger and they both knew it. Xenia smiled. \"I know you deserve it also, child. My pasiphae child. All-shining daughter.\" Pasiphae looked away. \"A stupid name - an arrogant one.\" \"A perfect fit for an arrogant princess. My Heliada. Daughter of Helius Hyperion. My bright Moon.\" \"You are getting ridiculously close to hubris.\" But she also couldn't help but smile. Outrageous flattery usually annoyed her -- Xenia and Minos were the only ones who somehow managed to pull it off. Her father also. Suddenly she threw her arms around Xenia's neck and cried openly in sobs and gasps. \"I miss my father already.\" Xenia just held her. \"I know, child... I know.\" The leader of the clan stared silently at the man. She knew she was getting old -- ninety years wasn't a youthful age, not even for a sphinx. She had raised two generations of hatchlings -- she would soon help raise a third. But her memory was still sharp, and right now it flew back to a time thirty-nine years ago. \"Your... grandfather, Hierax, was a very good friend to the clan.\" Minos nodded. \"And a very good friend to me. I... owe him a lot,\" she said again and smiled. This time he didn't react. \"And he was your grandfather.\" Again he didn't speak. The sphinx laughed suddenly and jumped to her feet. Going to the cave's mouth she looked below where a number of griffins were gathered. \"Daughter! Come up for a minute.\" Golden climbed and entered the cave. The leader smiled at her and motioned her to sit. \"Who are your mother and father, daughter?\" Golden seemed a bit surprised but answered. \"Your generation, of course, and the ones older than it -- you, our mentor, the elder who tells all those stories, your rookery sister with the three curving horns--\" \"Daughter!\" said the leader, stopping Golden's recitation. \"Not your rookery parents. Your mother and father. Who mated to lay your egg?\" The look of surprise on Golden's face was replaced by what seemed like disgust. \"I wouldn't know.\" The leader barked a laugh while Minos smiled. \"Of course you wouldn't. That's all, daughter. Sorry for troubling you.\" Golden left, confused, and Leader looked back at Minos. \"All our hatchlings are taught to consider the whole clan as their family -- their older generations as parents, the younger ones as children and little siblings. But you know all that of course.\" Minos looked at her in the eyes. \"Yet one has eyes to see. You two have the same horns that curve around the ears. The same hair.\" She nodded. \"But she has drunk the milk of many mothers -- and I have given suck to many children.\" She looked at him straight in the eyes. \"In all our talks I've never asked you if that bothers you.\" He shook his head. \"In Egypt, my lady, the Pharaohs often marry their own sisters -- a thing which would be anathema in the whole of Crete and Argos. In Phoenicia all young women partake in sexual feasts; in other lands absolute chastity is required before marriage. I've been in so many places that differences in custom don't bother me any more.\" It was a while before she finally spoke again, a bit more fiercely now and cloaking her wings around her body. \"For Hierax I would do anything. His grandson means nothing to me.\" His shoulders slumped; he closed his eyes. \"But his heir... his heir I'll help.\" Eyes still closed, he smiled. One Week Later In her dreams she was visited by all the people she had lost. She saw her father and cried in his arms. She met her mother there, who was but a kind voice and a gentle hand -- with a pang of pain Pasiphae realised once again that she could no longer remember her face. She saw Meriander, the first boy she had ever loved -- or at least been infatuated with. The last time she had seen him in the waking world he had been pierced by the horns of the bull he had challenged, the flowing red blood all too clearly imprinted in her mind. Since his death and before now, she had only dreamt him once -- in an erotic dream so vivid that it had left her flushed and short of breath in the morning. She saw Minos. Startled, Pasiphae awoke. She had heard a sound -- someone was in her room. But no servant would be so indiscrete as to enter her personal bedchamber; could an assassin-- \"Are you sleeping?\" whispered a familiar voice over her. Pasiphae let out a long, relieved breath. Turning to her side, she regarded the young sphinx with a look of amused exasperation. Then she sighed exaggeratedly and sitting up, brushed a long golden lock from her eyes. \"Not anymore. And would you bring a torch from the corridor? You know I don't have your eyes.\" Golden scurried lightly out and a moment later was back with a flaming torch which she placed on a stand. Pasiphae watched her with what she realised was tenderness -- the girl was silly, often annoying, sometimes infuriating. But she was always fun and would remain young and carefree even when they would all have gone old and grey. She was glad to realise that for that she loved the young sphinx more than she envied her. It was always good to see more than selfishness in your soul. \"What?! What are you staring at?\" Golden demanded. Youth, Pasiphae wanted to say. But she couldn't -- no chance the girl would realise how one could feel old while not yet twenty. \"Your dress. A little bit overdressed, aren't you?\" she said instead, teasingly: The girl wore a skirt and blouse that seemed specially tailored to suit her tail and wings. They were quite revealing for Achaean (though not Old Cretan) standards -- but they were certainly far more than she usually wore. \"You are telling me! But Minos insisted I have to wear clothes -- and, can you believe it, the Leader agreed! Not to mention Coeranus -- if I am to be his apprentice, I'll have to wear them almost all the time. What is it with humans, can you tell me? Why can't I go like always?\" \"The men would get distracted, the women would get envious, and from what I hear the little children would go blind.\" She chuckled and leaned back. Golden looked at her toes -- she was almost blushing. \"Nothing you could envy,\" she seemed to mumble, so low that Pasiphae almost didn't hear her. Don't be so sure, my sweet little girl. You have a whole clansful of parents. But again she couldn't say it; instead she only smiled. \"Did you come here just for a visit?\" she said at last. The sphinx-girl hesitated. \"He said it would be good for you if I were to come.\" Pasiphae's smile faded. \"Minos.\" \"He told me to carry you to him if you agree. He wants to talk to you.\" Does he, now? A pause. \"I won't go.\" Now Golden was becoming fidgety. \"He told me to remind you of Colchis if you refused.\" Pasiphae glared. And then she closed her eyes and breathed out, once. \"Very well,\" she sighed. Golden clapped her hands happily and immediately pulled her from under the blankets and out of the bed; she was already heading for the window, before Pasiphae managed to protest. \"Hey!\" \"What? Didn't you say you are coming?\" \"Yeah, but... I should get dressed first.\" Golden stared blankly for a moment uncomprehending, then looked down at the princess's naked body and rolled her eyes. \"You are such a human.\" Sarpedon always considered himself a man of deeds -- a warrior, not a scholar. But often you had to know before you acted, to speak before you moved. If only to decide which way to point your sword. And events seemed to tell him that through his absence from Knossos this last year he had missed out on a lot. \"And this? What is this for? Is it for a statue?\" He was examining a weird drawing. A naked man drawn from various different angles: but lines crossed the body in different directions without apparent meaning. Daedalus raised his head from his work and glanced at it briefly. \"It can help in one,\" he admitted -- \"but mainly it's a study of anatomy.\" Sarpedon let it slide. After all there was far too much in this workshop of the Athenian inventor that he couldn't understand. And those things that he could understand... he wasn't certain he always liked them. Nearby a bed-sheet covered an object of almost man-height. \"May I?\" Again the inventor glanced briefly from his work. \"Go ahead. But it's not yet finished.\" Sarpedon removed the sheet, almost dreading to see what kind of contraption would be hidden under there. This time it was simply the statue of a woman, carved in wood. Unfinished, yes. But the intent was obvious -- the woman was running; her half-torn dress exposed a breast. But she was not fleeing -- there was something on the face which despite its crudity (and the statue was crude in a sense which had nothing to do with its being unfinished) showed clearly that this was no damsel in distress. This was a goddess on the Hunt. \"Britomartis,\" he breathed. Daedalus nodded happily -- his eyes shone. \"It will be my best statue yet. Had a live model for that one. Minos brought her to me; I haven't ever --\" But Sarpedon was no longer listening. He was trembling. There was something here that was... alien. Or at least unknown. It had disturbed him from the moment he had stepped inside but he hadn't recognized it until now. He covered the statue again and stepped away from it. This man, this Daedalus. Where were his thoughts coming from? He had shown him such weird contraptions that ranged from that ridiculous folding chair all the way to this thing of crude... genius. Medicine, magic... even divination -- those could all be taught. But you couldn't train to think like this man -- inventing things that had not existed before; and not doing it once by accident, but repeating it time and again... He understood now it was closer to art than anything he had ever seen -- and yet unlike art it could give power to creator -- and ruler. This man... the gods could fear this man and others like him. \"Are you all right? You seem ill,\" Daedalus said. Sarpedon managed to smile. \"I'm fine. What are you working on now?\" \"Come and see.\" Sarpedon walked over. There was a wooden construction on the bench before the inventor -- no more than one palm in height or length. And Sarpedon couldn't of course understand it one bit. \"I call it a 'thrower'. It's a miniature of course, but it will suffice for demonstration when it's ready.\" \"What does it do?\" \"Throw things.\" The inventor laughed at Sarpedon's look. \"Rocks on ships or walls for example.\" \"Like Talos.\" \"Perhaps,\" Daedalus said with a forced smile. Sarpedon sensed he didn't like the topic -- perhaps the inventor disliked things like Talos that he couldn't comprehend. We have that much in common, at least. He went and looked out of the window, trying to think even though he felt like an idiot by simply being in this room. From here he could just see a large shape leap from a window in the palace and glide away, passing briefly in front of the full moon. Back to the business at hand. \"Tell me, friend,\" he said making his voice amiable. \"What do you know about the griffins?\" Golden let her down on the rooftop of the old palace. He walked from out of the shadows. \"Don't go too far. You'll be needed to take the lady back.\" Golden and her grey-skinned brother nodded and glided away. Minos and Pasiphae looked at each other in silence for a while. She saw how he wore the white clothes that queen Idyia had given him in Colchis -- the ones which seemed to glitter under the light of the moon and stars. The ones he had been wearing the night when they had first made love. Feeling manipulative tonight, Minos? Or simply regretful? He broke the silence. \"My queen.\" \"Only a princess, lord Minos.\" He ignored the correction. \"Tomorrow the games in honour of your father will begin, my lady. I will be there to compete also.\" \"Certainly.\" \"And I'll also be there to present myself among the contestants for the throne.\" She glared at him for a moment. \"They won't even notice you,\" she said at last, slowly. \"Oh, I think they'll do more than that. I think they'll also crown me. But I didn't bring you here to tell you that.\" She took a deep breath. \"What, then?\" Minos sighed and turned his back. He lowered his head for a moment. \"I don't know where to begin. I think that's why I came here. To find a beginning.\" She looked at him questioningly. He turned his head and looked at her, suddenly smiling. \"I mean this palace. A beginning. But I was foolish of course, this is but a place. I should have looked closer.\" She shook her head. \"I don't understand you.\" Minos' smile remained on his face, but his shoulders sagged somewhat. He sat down and stared across the plain. \"Never mind. But I wanted to explain to you why I am doing this. I myself didn't understand it for a few days. I thought it was just stubbornness, or my desire for you. But that would be foolish. It's far more than that...\" His eyes took a faraway look. \"I can feel it everywhere. There's a sense of decay in the air, in the ground. A sense that what is to come in the next century, perhaps in the next few decades, is all that there will ever be. In a sense, anyway.\" She hesitated. Then she sat down by his side. \"I really don't understand what you mean,\" she said, more softly now. He shook his head. \"The Hittites are warring with the Egyptians. It will be a long war and will lead both nations and other neighbouring ones into decay and death. In the Achaean country the descendants of Perseus are going into war over Mycenae.\" He paused again for a moment, then sneered. \"And, as if that wasn't enough, there's a time of heroes ahead.\" He had put such contempt into the word that Pasiphae shivered and moved away slightly. \"I don't...\" \"Heroes need enemies, my lady, heroes need monsters. And when enemies aren't coming to them, my lady, to what country will they bring their war? And when dangers are lacking, whom will they label as monsters and whom will they kill?\" He leaned towards her and she shivered again. \"Do you see them, my lady?\" he whispered in her ear. \"Golden and her young lover dancing in the currents of the wind? Will it be they, or will it be their future children that will be smashed in their sleep?\" She reacted to the certainty in his voice. \"It won't happen! I won't allow it!\" she shouted at him. He smiled bitterly. \"And who are you, my lady, to so ensure it?\" \"I am the queen!\" He stood up and looked at her in sadness. \"No, you are not. You are just a princess, my lady, though in better times you'd have been more than that. But whether queen or princess, you'll have no power over your husband or your realm. And if heroes cut off Golden's head, as Perseus did with Medusa's, you'll have no way to stop it from being dishonoured, no way to stop them from being worshipped.\" Her eyes glittered with tears. Whether it was for the future he was describing or for her father, she didn't know. But she hated herself for having been so affected by his words, for letting him see it, as she knew he could. He kneeled by her side again and touched her softly on the shoulder: his touch was suddenly too much to bear and she breathed in sharply in what was almost a sob -- her tears flowed freely from her eyes. Minos let her be for a while then slowly lifted her chin and stared into her eyes. He was hesitant now. \"I'm not a seer, my lady. I am not saying what will be.\" She suddenly laughed among her tears. \"I think I'm crying more for myself, than for any possible future of Golden.\" He smiled and wiped away her tears with the back of his hand. \"Don't. For either. No need. For though I'm no seer, my lady, I know that I will be king -- and Golden will live to have children and grandchildren.\" She smiled at his certainty. They looked at each other and he suddenly leaned over and kissed her deeply. \"I think you should be heading back. They may be searching for you,\" he said as they broke off the kiss. He helped her to her feet and waved at the two young sphinxes who turned in their aerial games and headed back for the building. \"Are they truly lovers?\" Pasiphae whispered at Minos. \"They are so young...\" He chuckled. \"I don't think they've even kissed actually. But they will be mated before year's end. And two years from now the obnoxious rascal will have an egg laid in the rookery!\" She threw an inquiring look towards him but he didn't notice it. Golden and her rookery brother alighted on the roof and once again Pasiphae let herself be lifted by the young sphinx-girl and as they flew off again she cast a last glance towards Minos. And she saw him shining motionless in the moonlight, silent and serious, wearing the clothes he had been wearing in that dance in Colchis when she had seen him and first understood she loved him, and he stared back; and his eyes shone like stars, and -- --and for a moment she truly believed beyond logic that he would indeed become her king and husband, that there was nothing that this man couldn't do. But the moment passed -- history doesn't work that way, no matter what the poets said. \"It doesn't work that way\" she whispered. Golden heard it. \"What doesn't work that way?\" Pasiphae turned towards her and smiled. \"Did you know that Minos has been making prophecies?\" \"He has? Hah. No fair. I am supposed to be the witch around here. What did he predict?\" Pasiphae felt light-headed. Her mood had already become better. \"Oh, nothing much. That he'll become king, that I will marry him, that by next year you and your rookery brother will be lovers,\" she said and instantly regretted it as Golden almost lost her hold on her and veered in her path before regaining her balance. The griffin-boy flew anxiously closer. \"What's wrong?\" Golden looked at him, turned instantly orange, tried to stammer a response and finally gave up and simply looked straight ahead. Pasiphae had turned pale, and now she tried to hold on more tightly. Nevertheless she somehow managed to laugh. \"Perhaps she'll tell you. But most probably she won't. Now, shoo! Girl-talk here.\" As the boy glided further away, Golden breathed in and out deeply. Then she glared at the smiling princess. \"If he had heard you, I'd really have dropped you,\" she hissed. \"A-ha.\" Pasiphae thought that she indeed might have, if only by accident. It might be the first time one truly died of embarrassment; though it would not be the embarrassed party that would fall to their death. \"As for Minos's prophecies, two out of three isn't that bad.\" Pasiphae lifted an eyebrow. \"Your meaning?\" Golden grinned. \"That it's my turn to prophesise: Less than a month from now I will be dancing in your wedding, princess. If I'm allowed to, that is.\" \"Only as long as I'm allowed to dance at your mating ceremony, little sister!\" \"Shut up!\" Great Mother, how he hated the Argives! This had once been a bright city in a majestic land. The centre of the Cretan civilisation, from where they had ruled all the known seas and occasionally reached the unknown ones beyond the straits of Hesperia near where Oceanus touched all mortal streams. A great city of a great land of a great people. And then the Argives had come, killing and burning and pillaging, a horde of crass barbarians with less respect for greatness or holiness than animals. And they imposed their foreign language and they erected their ugly buildings. He looked from the balcony of the palace at the city beyond. Yet even the Argives hadn't managed to destroy its beauty. Not entirely. Not irreversibly. Four kings. Tectamus. Asterius. Minos. Lycastus. It had lasted four kings and more than a hundred years -- but the Achaean dynasty of kings had finally ended. The next king would be Cretan. \"What are you thinking about, old friend?\" said a voice behind him. Kalliphon smiled. \"You, actually. You will make a great king, Rhadamanthys.\" \"So I hope, with the gods' help -- and yours!\" Rhadamanthys said. Kalliphon shook his head but he still smiled. \"The gods do as they do beyond my power to know or control -- but I'm honored that you think I helped you, lord.\" Rhadamanthys didn't comment on that one. Despite Kalliphon's words they both knew how much he owed to the man. He walked to him and also looked outside. \"It's a beautiful city, Rhadamanthys. Treat her well.\" \"I've not yet become king, old friend.\" Kalliphon shrugged. \"Who else? The Lycians are too few in number. And Sarpedon is no king -- only an insolent brat whose mother decided a descent from Zeus would be good for her son.\" Rhadamanthys smiled thinly at this. \"There's no one else. It's you. Our people.\" He was tired; he was old. But for the first time in a long while, Kalliphon felt... content. \"Let's go and get some sleep. It will be a busy day tomorrow.\" The Leader pulled herself up onto the roof. \"Decided where you are going to roost?\" Minos asked her. \"Here on the roof. \" Minos turned towards her. \"In public view? You are certain?\" \"We may be denied the sight of the Sun, but we prefer not to deny him the same courtesy. Will you protect us?\" \"Yes,\" he breathed. \"That settles it then.\" There was a long silence. \"Lady, are you certain about this?\" He was not speaking about their roosting place anymore. She smiled, wickedly. \"People think that we have no names of our own. But it's the opposite -- we have many and try to honour them all. I am Leader; shall I not lead my clan with pride? For Hierax I was once friend. Should I not honour that one either?\" Minos looked away. \"I won't hold you bound to any promise, given to me or any other.\" \"I remember this place well. I had last been here almost forty years ago. It's here that I mated for the last time -- when I conceived the only egg I ever laid.\" Still he didn't look at her. \"Your mate... I... have heard how brave he was.\" \"I remember how he called me my love. Of all my names that was my favourite until the time when my children first called me mother.\" At last he turned towards her, smiling. \"Beautiful one, mother of beautiful children.\" She also smiled, but it held sadness. \"Perhaps so, though beauty is lost, and youth goes away, and children grow up.\" \"And Azrael knows all our names,\" he whispered -- to himself, but she heard it. \"Yours and mine also.\" Next Night They came. All of them did from the ninety cities of Crete. There came fat Aedonius, lord of Cydonia. There came Dorianthus of Gortys and Epiander of Rhytium. From Lyctus came Bremus, and his father Hyperanthus. There came the Eteocretans. Many they were and fully dressed in armour, as was their custom to honour the dead king. In front of them went the young lord, golden-haired Rhadamanthys and on his side it was the grey-bearded advisor, general of old wars, wise Kalliphon, who held the reins of the chariot. They went with easy confidence and stern looks. There came the Lycians. Sarpedon rode in front of them, raven hair flowing in the wind, and laughter on his lips; youth was in his piercing blue eyes, and strength of war in his hands -- those who saw him that hour could easily believe his claim to be a son of Zeus and more than worthy to be counted among the grandchildren of Bellerophon, him who had dared to ride his flying steed all the way to Olympus and into an unknown destiny. There came Minos. Pasiphae had been taught the ceremony long ago -- when she was a child in the temple of the sun-god -- for she was indeed a heliad. She was a princess, she had been an athlete; but she had also been among the young women who had been initiated into the worship of Helius. Her tasks were few -- she was not fully devoted to the god, she was not a priestess in training. Up to now, it had influenced her life only briefly -- sporadically; when she was simply one of many who every year conducted the Midsummer ceremony; a few other smaller ceremonies throughout the year. And of course in Colchis last year. She closed her eyes against the memory... The thought of Colchis brought back memories of her friends there of course -queen Idyia and king Aeetes- but it mainly brought back memories of Minos too joyful, too intense to recollect without regret and grief. And she had to maintain her dignity. She had to keep her mind on the job at hand. The next stage of the... ordeal was beginning. The lords of the island would present themselves to announce their participation for the games tomorrow -- and some of them would undoubtedly announce their claim for the throne. She hoped against hope that Minos wouldn't be among them. She ignored the large majority of lords, acknowledging their words mechanically, as if she was an automaton no more alive than Talos. But now came one who she knew would lay the first claim. \"I am Rhadamanthys, son of Hephaestius, son of Calos. May the gods provide me with victory in the games -- may I be trusted with the rule of this land.\" Are you the one who killed my father? Are you the one I'll marry? As with the others, she gave him to drink from the sacred cup -- the wine and water mixed with blood from the sacrificed bull. The man stood and giving one last bow, stepped back. Rhadamanthys, you were seeking my hand in marriage. Perhaps you'll have it. But if you killed my father, the next cup I'll give you will hold poison. A few lesser lords announced themselves in turn -- all of them prayed for their victory in the games; but predictably none laid a claim on the throne. Pasiphae searched for Minos in the crowd, trying to not be obvious about it... His absence worried her: he was planning something. Xenia was right: he wouldn't abandon the-- The man that came forward now was Sarpedon with the dark hair and piercing blue eyes. She wondered briefly if the man would be so unbelievably bold as to name his father as Zeus. It seemed a lose-lose situation for him -- would he indirectly admit himself a bastard by stating no patronym? Or would he infuriate many by proclaiming himself semi-divine? \"I am Sarpedon, son of Laodamia, daughter of Philonoe. May the gods provide me with victory in the games -- may I be trusted with the rule of this land.\" She smiled -- she had momentarily forgotten this Lycian custom of naming mothers instead of fathers. No matter. They-- There was a commotion in the crowd -- someone was pointing and shouting something. Many faces were turned towards where the hand was pointing. And they all saw the many forms on the top of the temple. And then the sphinxes leaped and swooped over the crowd. The general reaction was surprise. Awe. Fear. Some fell to the ground, even though the sphinxes were flying far above their heads. Others still stood, seemingly dazed. Kalliphon was silent and unmoving, an indiscernible expression on his face -- but certainly not fear. Some took out their swords. Some guards lifted their bows and prepared to shoot. And seeing this, something suddenly clicked inside Pasiphae, a bit of half-forgotten lore mixed with a touch of fear for her friends. \"MAKE WAY FOR THE SACRED BEASTS! HONOUR TO THE MESSENGERS OF THE GODS!\" Her voice held authority. The other priestesses took the cue from her. \"MAKE WAY! HONOUR TO THE SACRED BEASTS!\" And reluctantly, fearfully, the people listened -- no arrows were fired, and when the leader of the clan (Pasiphae stood on her toes trying to see her tall form in the night) landed beyond the crowd, no one attacked her. \"MAKE WAY!\" she shouted again. And she was obeyed -- a corridor opened, through which the red sphinx passed. Pasiphae noted two things: first the sphinxes all wore clothes (varying from full armour all the way down to simple loincloths) and; second, that besides the leader walked Minos. Figures. \"My lady,\" he spoke to her, a step behind the sphinx, \"in the funeral games for Lycastus's father, forty years ago, the clan was there to pay their respects. Why was it not invited today?\" What is your game, Minos? \"An oversight,\" she told him curtly and turned to the leader. \"Since you were not awake to witness the funeral I did not think you'd desire to attend the ceremonies after. My apologies.\" The leader nodded pleasantly and extended a hand. They held wrists. Pasiphae could feel the stunned looks from some of the lords around -- but the most educated ones knew of the old pacts between Asterius or king Minos and the sphinxes. To them this was surprising in that it was unexpected, not in that it was unheard of. The leader stepped back. Minos moved forward and kneeled in front of her. \"I am Minos. May I be trusted with the rule of this land.\" He took the cup from her reluctant hands and drained it. \"Got you,\" said Sarpedon and smiled. Next Day They paused for a while before the fight to look at each other. \"Taking part in almost every sport. And almost always victorious. Why are you doing this?\" Sarpedon asked. \"One does what one must.\" \"Running. Boxing. Wrestling. In archery you defeated even Rhadamanthys. Did you know he was considered an unsurpassed archer in the whole of this island?\" \"I'm not from this island.\" \"Indeed! And though you have eyes of a hawk,\" continued Sarpedon, \"and strength of a bull, what good do you think it will do to you, a stranger in a foreign land? Who will want a foreigner as king, be he the best athlete and champion? Being a warrior is not enough.\" \"Are you describing me or you?\" Sarpedon chuckled. \"Indeed! Defend yourself!\" And he leaped ahead with spear at hand and they fought. \"Stop! Stop!\" the heralds cried. The fight had lasted only a little while but it had been so intense that the spectators had become very worried that death would be the result. \"The gods will punish us all if such a fight between obvious equals is continued. Let the prize be shared -- let no blood be spilled.\" Minos and Sarpedon stopped their fight and threw down their weapons. \"The gods? You think they'd care?\" Sarpedon whispered to Minos with a grin before moving away. \"Perhaps some would,\" Minos said softly to himself. \"It's not enough!\" said Sarpedon again. \"You know that, as well as I.\" \"Indeed.\" It's not enough. There will be a price. Minos breathed in deeply. It would be risky, but there was no -- He stopped short, briefly disgusted at his previous thought. There was a choice, there was always a choice. If there was no choice, all that remained was blind destiny or luck; and he'd never believed in either. So it was his choice. Be it so. He leaped onto the rock and cried out for attention, then waited for the gathered crowd to fall silent. He could feel Sarpedon's blue-eyed gaze intent on him. Rhadamanthys and Kalliphon also looked at him. \"PEOPLE OF CRETE!\" he shouted again when he was sure he had everyone's attention. \"Soon you will be asked to choose among us three contenders. You will have been asked to choose among three men you know almost nothing about.\" There was a small murmur but no protest yet. Patience. \"We've taken part in the games -- you now know of our skills in archery, in running, in chariot-races, in fighting. Yet what is this? Will the future king be required to do anything of these? Or will you try to judge us through our past deeds? Do you think that either of us has had experience with such a realm?\" If he remained at this, he would be in essence arguing against himself -- for he was the only one of the three who (to the lords' knowledge) hadn't ruled even a city -- while both Sarpedon and Rhadamanthys had. Even a minor Cretan lord often ruled over a territory larger than many an Achaean king. But not he. \"You know that it's ignorance that guides you. And it can be no other way.\" Several voices finally arose. He let it a few seconds until they were loud enough- \"Who are you to judge us\"-\"What do you want to do then?\" \"LET THE GODS DECIDE!\" he cried out. \"LET THE GODS DECIDE!\" The voices were silenced. \"Tales speak of what happens to those who don't have the favour of the gods -- and what happens to their realms. Misery and destruction. Tales speak of those who do have it -- we call them heroes.\" \"What do you want us to do then?\" It was Epiamus -- a minor Eteocretan lord with a booming voice. \"A lottery? An oracle? The gods aren't obliged to give us answers to our problems, nor do we want to invite their anger by constantly asking them to do so.\" \"BE IT SO!\" Minos shouted again. \"Let it be me alone who shall invite their anger -- or their blessing. For if some gods cared enough about our realm to give us the bronze Talos, it may be that they still care enough to give us a sign for the future king. If I have the favour of the gods, then may the same sign be given as a hundred years ago. Let a white bull come out of the sea -- let it pass through Knossos and be seen by all, so that all know who's favoured by the gods to be king under their blessing.\" He grinned at the silent faces and now spoke softly. \"If Rhadamanthys or Sarpedon desire it, let them also invite signs. But it is not necessary. By this time tomorrow you'll all have seen -- and you all shall know.\" He leaped down from the rock and walked through the skeptical crowd. \"Lord, why did you do that?\" Minos's voice was soft. \"Don't you believe in the gods, Creon?\" \"Of course I do, but...\" \"But?\" Creon's shoulders fell; but he could see the humour in his response. \"But not enough to bet anything of importance on their will.\" Minos laughed softly. \"Good for you. Now, please, you and the rest go home. I'll also be along. If the sign is enough, they'll send for us. \" Creon hesitated for a moment then walked away. Minos thought briefly about Creon's words... He was right of course. Trusting the gods was a sucker's game. He wondered if he was providing a bad example, then shrugged away the thought. He walked all the way to the cliff and felt the sea's wind on his face. He stripped himself of his clothes. As he went to remove his golden ring, he paused: it had once belonged to a king far above this kind of petty feuding. A man who he'd once held as dear as any grandfather. He left it on. And then taking one last look at the great drop before him, he leaped. \"What is he planning? Why is he doing this?\" Pasiphae's voice was almost pleading. Creon shook his head. \"I don't know, lady.\" But the sphinx leader smiled. \"He's Minos,\" she said. \"He does the... forbidden.\" Her expression sobered. \"And sometimes he regrets it.\" He expected the water to be as cold as Tartarus, as cold as death. But instead it was simply cool. Refreshing. Rejuvenating. He swam straight down, feeling the coolness in his body, letting its calming powers surround him. Why did he do it? What is he planning? That's the question everyone wondered about. The question that everyone would have forgotten by the next day. Because it had a ridiculously easy answer. Because everyone would be too awed to remember it. If they wanted to understand him, other questions should be asked. Questions where he himself wasn't sure he had the answers. For starters... why had he come here, three years ago? Why here? Crete was far from being the only place in the world where the name of Hierax or Mehy would be remembered... He could have chosen Phoenicia. Or Colchis where his sister and friend would arrange a kingly welcome for him. He could have stayed in Egypt: Ramesses anger was directed at Mehy -- he wouldn't care either way about a son. And of course he could always just go... home -- if it could still be called such. Truth is he had wanted to see the sphinxes again. He had wanted to see the men and women who had once befriended Hierax. The king Lycastus, a boy when Hierax had left, a strong king when Minos returned almost forty years later. The red sphinx-woman who had once been loved by Hierax. Her daughter. His body was now starting to ache for air, his lungs in pain. Still he pressed downwards. Why three years ago? Why not sooner or later? Why had he lingered and why had he hastened? The answer again presented itself: The death of Pharaoh Seti. Of my friend. Am I fleeing mortality? I've been in so many battles where the blood reached up to my knees. I've led a war against my own brother. In the dark streets of a ravaged city I've shouted in anger and anguish against the death of the firstborn. And though it was long ago, it was with my own will that I held the executioner's mace. But I can't avoid the truth. It was Seti's death that made me leave the land of Kemet; and he was far from being the first man whose death so affected me. When I leave here, whose death will I be fleeing? Laodamia looked at her son who was grinning. \"Your thoughts?\" \"Minos is betting everything on the will of the gods,\" said Sarpedon. Laodamia snorted. \"I was the lover of Zeus. But even I couldn't pray for a favour and know -or even hope!- that it would be fulfilled.\" \"A man must depend on himself. Only an idiot depends on the gods.\" Laodamia nodded. They stayed silent for a moment. \"Hmm... mother?\" he said at last. \"Yes?\" \"Minos is no idiot.\" His lungs were burning. He forced his body to remain calm -- to fight the instinctive panicky responses as he had long ago trained it to. The sharp feel of pain, the urge to find air, to swim to the surface -- he savoured it for a moment, before consciously choosing to swim upwards. All the sensations that a body could provide -sometimes even that of pain- were to be treasured. A body was to be treasured: Not everyone had one after all. As he strove to the surface, he wondered how each would be treating his words... With puzzlement certainly... with some disdain. Sarpedon, always full of blasphemous pride, would certainly consider him a fool. Rhadamanthys was more respectful of the gods but like almost everyone had learned to not expect their interference. Pasiphae, Creon, Leader... they'd just be puzzled. As they should be, really... Gaining the favour of a god was difficult. Practically impossible. He felt and savoured every sensation. The dark coldness of the water, the agony of his lungs... the sting in his eyes, the tiredness in his hands and legs. His body.... from head to toes, he knew it. And still below the surface of the water, he changed it. He came charging out of the water -- now owning the form of a great white bull. Gaining the favour of a god was difficult and rare. Being one was rather easier. It was early afternoon when he reached the city of Knossos. The Bull stepped forward, a form more majestic than any earthly beast, a creature obviously sent by Poseidon or Zeus himself. And everyone saw. And everyone believed. And myths were born. In a long existence he had had many names and many forms. He was Minos. He was Mehy. He was Hierax. He was Min, the phallic deity, and falcon-headed Montu, the warrior god, and he was Horus the Elder, avenger-of-his-brother. He was Menes, first humaniform Pharaoh of Mortal Egypt. He was the divine hawk. And right now he was the Bull From The Sea, sign of the gods. He passed through the city. Walked slowly among the streets and among the awed crowds. None dared touch him. Then slowly, purposefully, he headed outside the city and towards his home. In the stables he turned himself back to human, and picked out a normal bull. He changed its colour to a spotless white and then went inside and dressed. Many forms, many roles, many names. So be it. That Night It had begun rather playfully. \"Yet another name to add on your admirers list, sister?\" her rookery brother asked as he threw a grape at her. He'd somehow obtained a huge cluster of them and the two of them were quickly devouring them as they were leaving the city... \"I have a list of admirers?\" she laughed catching the grape easily and popping it into her mouth. \"Why am I not informed of these things? You'd think they'd let me know, wouldn't you? Is it a long one?\" \"Huge.\" Was there a small edge in his voice, or had she imagined it? \"There's that servant boy in Minos's home, Andromachus.\" \"He does glance my way, I admit...' \"If he stared any more intensely, his eyes would fall out of their sockets.\" Another grape thrown, caught and eaten. \"Then there's Polyidus, the wizard's son. He lost his words when he first saw you.\" \"And fumbled a spell because of it.\" She giggled. \"Right. And now it's Daedalus!\" She shook her head. \"You are wrong.\" \"I saw him staring. You even went to confront him about it. What did he say?\" Again she laughed. \"His exact words were 'Can I study your flight?' \" \"What!?\" \"Of all the men who've admired my body--\" \"--the dozens of them--\" \"-shut up- he's the only one fascinated by my wings. \" He fell silent for a moment, then grinned mischievously. \"Kinky.\" She let out an incoherent cry and attacked him in mid-air even as he smirked. His eyes widened slightly and he tried to evade. But it was too late: she pushed him off balance with her feet and letting out a grunt of pain he lost his hold on the cluster. Swooping down she caught the grapes with a triumphant shout. Which quickly turned to a yelp of surprise when the boy landed on her back and pinned her three lower limbs together with his tail. \"Give it back,\" he growled softly in her ear as they were both falling with an uncomfortable speed... and she was suddenly acutely aware of the feel of his body. She felt as if she was blushing and paling all at once; her breath halted. \"Please...\" she managed to get out. \"Huh?\" \"Let go...\" His tail's hold on her loosened abruptly... and not trusting herself to glide, she landed and leaning against a tree she tried to control her breathing -- and thoughts. She didn't look at him when he also landed by her side. There was a silence for a long while... \"Want us to go get washed?\" came his soft voice -- it startled her and she looked at him blankly for a moment. He waved a hand vaguely and awkwardly -- the poor boy was so embarrassed through no fault of his own that she couldn't help but smile -- but she also understood what he was indicating... they were both covered in grape juice. \"Yeah... or Creon will have us eaten, rather than welcomed.\" She winced at the lameness of her own joke; nevertheless it remained a good idea to bathe. For starters, she could use the cold water. They climbed: there was a small stream that came down from the nearby mountain to join the Caeratus river; it was too shallow to bathe in, but five body-lengths up the mountain it fell over a small precipice to create an even smaller waterfall. She went under the stream first and moved to clean the grape juice off her body, while her rookery-brother sat nearby on a small ledge, his chin in his hands. The water was icy cold as she had thought it would be. But she smirked at her own thoughts of a few minutes ago: hadn't she been silly? True, the touch of her rookery brother's... anatomy had made her uncomfortable. And true she couldn't help but notice how it had... grown in the last few years. (She could feel herself blushing again and turned her face away) But (she hastened to add), so had they all grown. All her brothers and sisters, and she as well. And if their growing anatomy made some games uncomfortable, then they'd have to play other games. And those... feelings she'd felt had nothing to do with her rookery brother in particular, only the awkwardness of the position. There. Logical as that. Nothing to worry about. Then why could she almost see Minos's smirk, making fun of her and her attitude? Because of his \"prophecy\". Ignore it. And make conversation. Even as she spoke she knew she'd chosen the wrong topic: \"Really brother, what is it with all the humans -- I mean they are fine and all... but you'd think it would be sphinxes that should be admiring me, wouldn't you?\" There was a long pause. Her tail started twitching in nervousness. \"One already does.\" Her tail stopped twitching. \"I...I think I love you,\" he said suddenly, his voice quick, all hope, all fear... She had frozen. She remained silent, practically unmoving, her back turned to him for a long time... She didn't dare turn to look at him; she suddenly didn't want to meet his gaze which was surely piercing her all the way through... \"I'm sorry!\" he shouted suddenly and his voice made her turn in time to see him glide away in a half-panic. She almost cried out to stop him, but she didn't: she didn't know what to say. She was still standing awkwardly under the water and wondered if she looked like the idiot she felt. Why didn't I tell him something? She sat down and hugged her knees. What do I tell him? He's my friend, not my mate! Not in his mind, said a different thought. And not in yours either. Not anymore. I never treated him as anything more than a brother. Except for brief moments, hidden stares, contemplations so secret you didn't admit to yourself... Except for that time but a few minutes ago. Oh, hell! She felt like crying, but didn't know if it was out of sadness, out of joy, or out of sheer frustration. What do I tell him? That you love him, too. Do I? I... want him. That has to be different... And for the first time, she recognized that part of her mind as the most insightful one. What do I tell him? It was then that she saw the soldiers pass by, through the valley below. Heading straight for Minos's house. They moved quickly but silently in dark clothed formations. Their clothes were dark, and the darkness was their ally; for the clouds covered the light of the moon and stars. And though they were all brave men of Crete, who would not hesitate to charge in the full heat of battle, they recognized the usefulness of stealth. They were not far now. They could see the megaron from here. It would be easily taken -- the handful of servants that were there would be taken by surprise. It was then that they saw the sphinx, gliding over them and beyond them, hastening to the house, giving out a shrill cry of warning. Their leader frowned -- his face became terrible for a moment. Then he raised his sword. \"Attack!\" he shouted. And the soldiers charged. He fought. It was the first real battle of his life: up to now he had trained with the rest of his brothers and sisters as their Leader and their Teacher demanded, but real battle... he'd never experienced that. He ducked under a spear that was thrust towards his direction; then he leaned forward swiftly and grasping the hand that held it he pulled. As a result the soldier was sent flying head over heels into the nearby wall; he fell to the floor unconscious. Catching his breath he checked the situation around him. No one moved in this room; two soldiers unconscious and an old servant of the house who was still awake but incapable of fighting further -- he sat against a wall and held in pain his bleeding side. The soldiers had managed to break into the house quickly. Though at least three of them lay dead outside, killed by the arrows that the human boy Andromachus had hastily shot at them, they hadn't managed to close the doors before the enemies approached. And that could mean defeat. Even as he thought, he rushed on all fours through the corridors of the house. Someone suddenly leaped before him with naked sword: but the soldier's eyes widened when he saw a running sphinx rather than a running human. The boy used the man's surprise and hesitation to his full advantage: Even as he run past the soldier he extended his tail and used it to catch a leg and send him off balance and onto the floor. He then grabbed the man's head and hit it on the floor, sending him to dreamland. Then he resumed his run. The banquet room was a mess with tables overthrown, pots broken, and a number of men lying unmoving on the ground -- he guessed that most of the fallen enemies were the result of his sister's actions: the human residents of this house were mostly untrained and unprepared for combat. Then his eyes widened. Among the fallen there was... Andromachus. A mere boy, no more than seventeen years; and quite certainly dead. His clothes were red with blood -- a sword-wound had been his death -- his bow and arrows lay idle at his side... He gulped and steadied himself against the table. He should have been here. Here where -- He suddenly remembered that his sister had last been by Andromachus' side and he paled. \"Sister!\" he bellowed. \"Here!\" the voice came weak and exhausted from the rooms upstairs. He strode upstairs and into the first doorway there: he should have never let himself be separated from her. Three soldiers were there: they were driving his sister towards the end of the room: she had grabbed a small table and vainly tried to defend herself against the attacks of all three -- she was already bleeding from wounds in her arms. He felt his eyes glow as he rushed unthinkingly towards them. With all the force he could muster he pushed one of them into the wall -- but the other two had already turned, swords drawn. And the man whom he still held seemed only mildly dazed: he had the strength to painfully hit him on the back with his cuffed fists. Thinking rapidly, he did the only thing that crossed his mind. Grunting he managed to suddenly turn around so that it was the man who would first face the threat of the sword blades rather than his own back... He didn't know if it was actually right in any way to use a human as shield, but he'd hoped the others would hesitate to attack when they'd endanger their own-- --when the man sucked in his breath and his eyes suddenly took a look of amazement. As if by common agreement they both looked down to see the edge of a sword sticking out of the man's chest -- who had been pierced all the way through -- unknowingly accepting the strike that had been intended for the sphinx. The man died. The boy let him fall slowly to the ground and then looked up in horror to face the equally horrified soldier who'd just killed one of his own. They both stood unmoving for a moment, gasping. The other human still standing didn't waste time, though. With a cry the large warrior raised his sword -- and was promptly knocked to his knees, hit by the table that his rookery sister still held, and after that driven unconscious by her fist. The last soldier still stood uncertainly, bloodied sword in hand. Then he turned around and ran. And the boy sank to his knees and cried. And even in this sorrow, even as she knelt by her brother's side, to soothe and comfort him as much as she could, even then a part of her mind still managed to think: \"Now I love him.\" Supporting each other they stood up. And went back to the battle. The hawk alighted on a hill far from the megaron so that no one would see it, and changed back into human form. After putting on the clothes that he had left there, he started walking the rest of the distance on foot. His appearance as Bull (let alone the well-noticed direction it had taken) had caused quite a stir in the city which he hadn't wanted to miss, so he had listened in to it using his other favourite form. On the whole there was no question about it -- in the morning the throne would be his. Minos wondered if it could even be called trickery. \"Let the gods decide...\" -- one of them indeed had. And if other gods objected... he'd cross that bridge when he came to it. Distracted with such thoughts he headed back for the megaron and was unprepared when the hiding (and far more alert) warrior jumped on him and threw him to the ground. It was Sarpedon. The man fought. And killed. Damn! He had wanted this to be near bloodless. But those sphinxes ruined everything. He gathered news from his soldiers: he had lost about ten of his thirty, and on the defenders' side five or six had been killed, those who had fought too furiously to be captured safely. But the battle was nearly over. He checked out the half dozen servants in front of him and ordered three of his soldiers to escort them down to the cellars. Then he sent another three to guard the main entrance, and gathering the remaining six around him he headed for the banquet room. Hardly had they entered when the sphinxes fell on top of them, knocking him to the side in the ensuing confusion. He cursed himself again -- he had never before fought against airborne opponents. Two of his men were already down before he had even known what had happened, first stunned by the sudden weight of the sphinxes on their shoulders and then punched into unconsciousness. The remaining four of his men had already divided the two sphinxes among them as he stood up. He focused his eyes on the seemingly weaker pair -- they fought the snouted grey male who held them away with a shield he had picked up. Helyon's spear was grabbed by the beast's tail and broken as the soldier was thrusting it forward -- as the man tried to take out his sword, the sphinx's tail moved again and tripped him up. \"Helyon, Termon, aside! Let me!\" They leaped aside and away. They were good men, but hadn't learned patience or caution. And neither had the sphinx. The male sphinx just leaped at him, its eyes glowing fiercely, claws extended. And Kalliphon raised quickly his spear and let the grey creature impale itself upon it, the spear tearing through its stomach and all the way to the other side. Behind him, the golden-skinned female screamed. She heard herself scream, wordlessly. And then she rushed forward, barely stopping to scratch at a soldier's face before leaping on Kalliphon. She landed on his fist. As with her brother, it was Golden's own inertia that did the most damage -- Kalliphon felt as if he was punching a wall, but Golden was no less hurt. And then his foot kicked her hard on the stomach and, as the breath went out of her, the two men behind her grabbed one of her arms each and one of them had stepped on her tail. And she couldn't move and another one punched her again and again, and as she lost consciousness her last thought was her grey skinned brother, friend, love dying on the floor. \"She's out,\" said Taphius lifting the female's chin ungently. Kalliphon leaned heavily on the wall and gasped catching his breath. Damn that Egyptian wizard. Damn his sphinxes. \"She gave us a great deal of pain.\" That was Helyon. \"Well, now she's going to give us a great deal of pleasure,\" growled Taphius. \"Hold her for me.\" He placed a hand on the unconscious female's left breast, while the other grabbed coarsely her crotch. And then his eyes widened, and he toppled to the side, with an expression that was more confused than pained: Kalliphon had just slit the would-be rapist's throat. He still held the bloodied knife in front of him, sternly, and the other soldiers stared at it as if hypnotized. \"We... are... Eteocretans,\" Kalliphon intoned, emphasis on every word. \"We are not monsters.\" \"Get off me!\" \"Stay down! Stay down, you fool. They placed guards -- they'll shoot you full of holes before you even see them.\" Minos pushed him away. \"What are you saying?\" Sarpedon gestured towards the megaron. \"The Eteocretans.\" Minos's eyes widened. There will be a price to pay. A personal price, dammit! He clenched his fists, and quickly stood up and started for the megaron ahead. \"I've sent for help! They'll be here soon,\" whisper-shouted Sarpedon at him. Minos didn't pause. \"Then wait for them,\" he growled. \"You can't defeat them all. Not alone! Not in human form!\" Minos stopped. His lips briefly formed a grim smile. He half-turned and regarded Sarpedon seriously for a moment. \"Then follow me!\" He leaped from the hill and his body glowed briefly -- weapons flashed into existence in his hands. Sarpedon's eyes widened and then he too charged down. And none could hinder them two, the teacher and the son of Zeus. He was Minos. He was Hierax. He was Min, the phallic deity, and he was Horus the Elder, avenger-of-his-brother. He was Menes, first humaniform Pharaoh of Mortal Kemet. He was the scion of the Divine Bull, he was the half-human god. He was Montu, warrior god of Egypt. And he had fought in hundreds of battles. He hadn't even been born for the First War, when Apep Ahriman was thrown down and El Aranu (or Helius Uranus, or Lord Ra, or a number of other names in many lands) took his place as Great Mother Mab's consort and king of all gods. But when Aset was lost -- when Cronos overthrew Aranu, Min was there. And though he had been no more than a child, he had clenched his fist and sworn an oath of vengeance. And he killed. It was like a dance, and he let the rush of the battle take hold of him -- to feel drunk with the blood, with the exertion, with the death. Like Odin's berserkers, like Sekhmet in her blood-frenzy, like Kali. Except that he still held on to a part of sanity, lest he kill all, friends and foes alike. And he had danced so as to hide the birth of Zeus. And he had helped teach him. And in the war that came, he had fought at his side. And he killed. He moved like the wind, and his sword was like lightning. And he laughed. As he would fight at the side of another young pupil and kinsman many centuries later when brother would slay brother and he'd once again be turned into teacher and into warrior, into king and into avenger. And he ki... \"MINOS! Not him.\" And he blinked. And it was over. \"Kalliphon,\" he growled as he lowered his sword. The man had been disarmed and thrown to the ground ready for the kill, before the interruption. \"Rhadamanthys!\" He clenched his fist. Sarpedon was standing at the doorway, somewhat out of breath. \"Actually, no, I don't think so. My guess is it was solely him.\" He indicated Kalliphon. \"Rhadamanthys probably has no idea, or he wouldn't dare allow him--\" \"Help me! Someone HELP!\" It was Golden, more desperate than Minos had ever heard her. Kalliphon forgotten, he rushed out and towards her voice. Creon was already standing over them when he reached the room. She was cradling the boy in her arms. A boy who was obviously bleeding to death. His eyes were becoming unfocused even as Golden urged him to look at her -- his entire body was shuddering. \"Lord... there's no way he's going to survive till dawn,\" Creon told him as he approached. All his former energy had drained away. Minos suddenly felt tired. And old, very old. He let his sword drop. \"Andromachus is dead. Pandeia and Chaleion too. And more. I won't know for sure how many until we make a count.\" Creon's voice was flat, a mask for grief. \"DO SOMETHING!\" Golden wailed at them. Sarpedon appeared in the doorway. \"Only the gods can save him now.\" His voice was bitter, sarcastic. Minos slowly turned his head towards him. \"And gods forbid that gods shall care to enter into lowly mortal affairs!\" Once they did. It wasn't much better. \"Who do you think you are?\" said Creon, aghast. But Minos wasn't listening anymore. He kneeled to the side of the griffin-children. \"DO SOMETHING!\" she yelled at him. Her body was covered with bruises -- her eyes were filled with tears. And Minos suddenly felt love. He took her hand in his own and placed them both on the boy's open wound. \"...do something...\" \"My... girl does love this boy grey, So turn to stone before the day.\" Golden turned to look at her brother as he lay in her embrace -- and then her face's agonised expression froze. With a loud crackle they both turned into stone, and would remain so throughout that night and the following day. It was done. He knew that there would be a price. But it was his own to pay and he wouldn't suffer others to pay it for him. He walked away, while Creon still stared, dumbfounded. Sarpedon grabbed his upper arm as he swept past. They stared into each other's eyes. \"Well done.\" \"Let go.\" Sarpedon let him, but as Minos walked away, he followed. \"So, what was the justification for bending your kind's law this time?\" Minos clenched his fist. \"This is my home. And those are my clan's children. And it was my deeds that had caused this. I wasn't bending anything.\" \"I see. And for bending it earlier today?\" Minos's eyes flickered with an undiscernable expression. He stopped where a couple of servants were guarding Kalliphon and gave them further instructions. Then he walked away again. \"Why did you help me, Sarpedon?\" \"It was the honourable thing to do? A virtuous deed in an evil world?\" \"Stop.\" \"Very well. It was because of your eyes.\" Minos waited for more, and Sarpedon obliged, smirking. \"They were the same as the eyes of a child that I dreamed had once helped save my father. The least I could do was try and repay the favour.\" The hint of a smile appeared on Minos's lips. \"That was long ago.\" \"I only heard about it recently.\" They walked outside into the clean air. The smell of death and blood was strong inside. Minos sat down and leaned his head back to the wall. \"Going for the kingship was wrong, wasn't it? Bloodshed's the very first thing it caused.\" Sarpedon shrugged. \"Who would you have as better ruler?\" \"Pasiphae.\" \"Hah! For the Amazons, perhaps, \" Sarpedon smiled, \"though not all their customs would appeal to her. But this is the Crete of later times and you are no fool.\" Minos closed his eyes. \"You, then.\" \"I'm a warrior. And a foreigner. And a bastard. I somehow think the greatest difference between us is that you have a lot more experience being all three.\" Minos froze. And then he threw his head back and chuckled softly. \"Ah!\" Sarpedon said again. \"They are here.\" \"Your soldiers?\" \"Your sphinxes. And your princess. \" Minos snapped his eyes open even as the red leader let Pasiphae down. More griffins were landing around them. \"Minos! Sarpedon's men told us--\" \"It's over.\" He stood up and walked away from them. \"My children, Minos! Where are they? Don't play games with me,\" the Leader growled. \"They are inside,\" he heard Sarpedon answer. \"They are healing in stone. Minos changed them.\" Pasiphae stared uncomprehending. \"Stone by night? Minos did what?!\" He fled. Leader regarded the man for a moment, then turned to the princess. \"After him.\" Pasiphae was still confused. \"What?\" \"After him. If you want to see him again within the decade, after him, NOW!\" \"I have a horse nearby,\" offered Sarpedon. Pasiphae made up her mind. \"Take me to it.\" Another time, more than a century ago. He found her on the beach, as he had hoped. Europa liked walking by the seashore, under the light of the full moon. \"Hello, my lady.\" She didn't turn, but even so he could feel the joy of her smile. \"I was hoping to see you again.\" \"How could I leave without a last goodbye?\" \"You are Min. You often do the forbidden.\" She turned and they looked each other directly in the eyes. There were no lies between them. No deception. \"I've wished you joy, since the very first time I met you. It does my heart good to see you happy.\" She smiled at that. \"Did you ever love me, my friend and saviour?\" Min considered this for a moment. \"I did love you. But I'm a god of passion, not of love. I loved you less than you loved me. And it wasn't even a tenth of the love you have for Asterius. I could burn in your love. You wouldn't be even mildly scorched in mine.\" He smiled. And then there was very little to be said aloud. As if by unspoken agreement they moved forward and hugged for a long moment. \"I will look after you. You and your son both, as much as I can.\" Europa's hand rested on her swollen belly. \"I will name him after you.\" \"Goodbye.\" And then he stepped back and, with his eyes still on her, he changed into hawk shape and flew away, towards the full moon. Rhadamanthys stepped down from his chariot. He knew, long ago he had been taught, that each man was required to do three things on any moment of decision. To learn, to gather all info pertaining to the situation. To choose among all possible options. And finally to execute his decision once it had been taken, swiftly and without hesitation. Learn, choose, execute. He had also been taught that a ruler, since his cares are so large, does all three with help from others. He gathers all info with help from spies and messengers. He decides with help from his advisors. And lastly, he has his soldiers and servants to execute his commands. And sometimes this doesn't apply and even a king must do these things by himself. Learn. He saw the pile of the dead Eteocretan soldiers as they had been dragged uncaringly outside by the servants of the house -- among the corpses were way too many faces he recognised. He saw the blood being cleaned from the floors and walls with sponges and water. Soon sulphur would be brought to purify the house. If such a thing can ever really be done. He saw the statue of two griffin-children. The girl held in her arms a boy, which was dead or dying. Care and pain and love was carved in her features -- the statue had managed to capture a moment of ultimate pathos. Rhadamanthys shuddered as he understood it was no statue at all. His voice was soft and he didn't even look at the fettered man. \"Tell me what has happened here, Helyon. Leave nothing out, or die.\" Choose. \"Kalliphon.\" The bound man raised his head at the voice. \"Hello, my lord.\" \"What did you try to do here, old friend?\" Rhadamanthys' voice was tinged with horror. \"To destroy the Egyptian. I failed.\" In contrast, Kalliphon's voice was calm. And regretful. \"Why didn't you come to me?\" Kalliphon didn't look at him. \"You... would have said no. And it was unfitting that you should begin your kingship so.\" Rhadamanthys clenched his fists. \"The deed would be the same whether I knew about it or not!\" he growled. \"But the doer would be different. You'd make a good king, Rhadamanthys. I'm sorry.\" Rhadamanthys staggered, and leaned heavily on the wall. He had to think. \"It wasn't worth it, Kalliphon. It wouldn't be worth it, even if you had succeeded without a single loss.\" Kalliphon's eyes flared briefly. \"It was worth it. This is the land of the Eteocretans!\" He breathed in deeply and closed his eyes before continuing. \"It was too much. More than a hundred years of Achaean rule. And now an Egyptian! Befriending the king. Courting the princess. Aiming for the throne. Lycastus was prepared to name him as his heir.\" Rhadamanthys didn't want to believe the thought that had crossed his mind \"You didn't...\" Kalliphon opened his eyes and looked up at the man. \"Lycastus? Yes. I did.\" Oh, old friend! When Rhadamanthys spoke, his voice was steady. \"Minos has surrendered you to my care. To my judgement.\" Kalliphon felt a flicker of surprise. \"I... see. By waiving the right to judge...\" He didn't like what he was going to say and he stopped. Rhadamanthys's eyes hardened. \"Yes. All comes with a price. By waiving the right to judge you, he's now into a position to judge me. By making me responsible for you, I am now responsible for you. By making me judge, he made himself king. \"And my judgement will reflect on us all.\" Kalliphon didn't speak. \"Tell me something. Anything,\" Rhadamanthys said again, still striving for control but despair threatened to creep into his voice. Kalliphon looked old, tired. Defeated at last. \"Do not exile me. Away from Cretan soil, I'll slay myself.\" Anything, old friend... Anything! \"I hear that Taphius was going to ravish the sphinx. You killed him.\" Kalliphon's eyes once again flashed as if with their last strength. \"We are Eteocretans. We do not mate with beasts!\" It was not the answer that Rhadamanthys had been hoping for. Tears in his eyes, he kissed the older man on the forehead. And then he raised his sword. Execute. \"Minos!\" He didn't turn. He just kept on walking, walking fast. Not towards something, Pasiphae understood, just away. \"Minos!\" She swerved her horse to stand on his way. \"Where are you going?\" He raised his head to look at her. There was blood, unwiped blood, on his face but it wasn't his own. \"Why, Pasiphae? Do you even know where I have been?\" \"Why are you going?\" \"Why did I ever stay?\" He stepped around the horse and kept on walking. Pasiphae leaped down and grabbed his arm. \"I had thought it was because of me.\" Minos smiled bitterly. And shook his head. \"No. I think it was because of another. And she almost died because of me.\" He shook off her hand. \"And you, my lady, don't know me.\" And, in front of her astonished eyes, he transformed into a bull, his clothes ripping and falling at his feet. And then he turned and galloped away. She stood motionless for a moment, staring. And then she clenched her fists. \"Then you don't know me either,\" she said and gave chase. Sarpedon was sitting on the stairs, when Rhadamanthys stepped out of the megaron. The red sphinx-leader was nearby; her arms crossed, deep in thought. \"Want to sit with me?\" Rhadamanthys seemed not to understand. \"Only if you want to,\" shrugged Sarpedon. Rhadamanthys sat on the stairs next to the Lycian. He seemed vaguely lost. Even Sarpedon knew how to respect a man's grief. But he felt he had to say something. \"It was... well done. Well done by Minos. Well done by me also, I think. And in the end it was well done by you as well.\" He felt Rhadamanthys's body go tense with anger next to him, and he hurried to continue. \"Don't misunderstand me. I mean it was far better than it could have gone otherwise. And you also know that.\" \"It's far worse than what could have been.\" \"I... don't think so. Unless Kalliphon had never been.\" Rhadamanthys's anger again flared and he stood up, hand on the hilt of his sword, but Sarpedon had tired of this. He also stood up and looked at the man. \"Think of this, Rhadamanthys,\" he told him. \"Would you want Kalliphon as king? Who saw all Achaeans as enemies? That was the only other alternative. Not me. And never you. It was Minos and Kalliphon, and just the two of them.\" And then he walked away. The red sphinx looked at Rhadamanthys. \"I disagree with him, you know.\" Rhadamanthys looked at her. He wasn't in the mood for conversation. \"You do?\" \"Yes. It was always Minos and Minos. And just the two of them. And the winner has not been decided yet.\" She smiled. \"Minos is always and ultimately a man in conflict with himself.\" Another time, almost forty years ago. It was the Fall Equinox. It was also an equinox that came only once every twenty years. The sounds of mating were carried on the wind, the smell of life was in the air. The agony of loss was in her heart. The red sphinx-woman was gliding away as fast as her wings could take her. Not towards anywhere, just away. She couldn't stand to be anywhere near her mating sisters and brothers, when her own love was so recently dead -- her tears were mingling with the soft rain. Through her blurred vision she thought she saw movement at the edge of her sight, but when she turned there was nothing. Had it been a week already? \"The human king honored our brother so much,\" they had told her, \"that he lost his own life trying to save him.\" What did she care? Her sisters' comfort was hollow, her clan's grief seemed but a mockery of her own. Her heart was dead inside her. It was as if she had been sleepwalking through the entire time -- barely eating, almost never talking, as much dead to the world as her golden-skinned love was. She could feel nothing. But this night, at mating season, there was no griffin above the age of ten that could feel nothing, when the earth, their bodies, their very souls cried out Mate! Breed! Love!, when they were all tense with desire, their eyes in a semiconstant bright glow that revealed their state of mind as much as their bodies did. Again she thought she saw something, someone, the shape of a sphinx gliding in the rain just a bit further than she could recognize the one. In anger that anyone (who? a widowed elder? A mateless youth?) would intrude in her grief, she turned towards his direction. But the shape disappeared before she could reach it. She envied the ten-year-olds. Their blood didn't beat hot against their veins, their bodies weren't going stiff or moist. When she had been their age, during mating season they had all been placed in the rookery, where they played simple games all night long, with only a few widowed elders supervising them, and no knowledge of what was taking place outside. Twenty years later (and fifteen years old with the human count) she had felt all too well the boiling blood, the urge to mate. But though she had already fancied the golden boy who would later become her lover, she hadn't dared to even go near him during the season, lest she could not control her actions. She had instead found a secluded spot and (though with shame and guilt) had tried to satisfy herself with her own tail. It hadn't worked much. She had once thought that tonight, fifty years old and at the very peak of her youth, she would pity her teenage self, but instead she was envying her with all the strength of her heart. And now she half-landed half-crashed on the roof of the building in front of her (the abandoned palace it was), and there she lay and waited and held the pain inside her, until she was trembling with the unreleased sobs and finally she gave out a terrible wail of grief and anguish. And as if her wail had summoned him from the lands beyond, he walked out of the rain. In the beginning he was just a unidentifiable figure, blurred by both the rain and her tears. And then as she strained her eyes, the golden colour of his wings could be seen, and as he approached further she gasped and almost swooned, for it was her golden-skinned love that appeared in front of her. She struggled for her voice but he silenced her with his eyes. \"Say that it never happened,\" they were saying. Any other night she would have sought for answers. Any other night she would miss most his soft voice, and his light sense of humour, and the simple touch of his hand as they looked at the stars. Tonight, though, she just wanted his body against her own, making passionate love to her with no word spoken by either until dawn came. She pulled him close, and they both gasped as their bodies collided, entwined, merged into one. And yet, even as she gave and received pleasure, there were still tears in her eyes. For a part of her mind already knew that this was not her love, whom she would never see or touch or talk to again. And that like most gifts of this kind it would vanish with the dawn, little proof that it ever happened remaining behind. But nonetheless she let herself be deluded. And although the next night she would wake up indeed alone, it turned out that the egg she'd lay six months later would be proof enough. The Bull ran, and behind him Pasiphae was pursuing, even as the moon pursues the sun. How can you chase a god? You can't. Not if he really wants to go away. But Minos was exhausted. And more importantly he was always, and ultimately, a man in conflict with himself. A man of two natures. A man of many names. They ran through forest and over stream -- through glade and over hill. The occasional shepherd or farmer who'd see them would wonder with awe at the spotless white colour of the bull, at its majestic form. They were even more amazed with the golden-haired young woman that followed the bull at full speed first on horse, and then (when the terrain proved too uneven) on her own feet, as fast as they could take her. Some god must have maddened her, they said. Poseidon, perhaps, who must have sent the bull in the first place. Or Aphrodite who oft instills unholy passions into the heart. They were perhaps getting close with that last one, but only metaphorically speaking. She didn't really know why she was chasing Minos. A part of her mind, the proud, regal, perhaps arrogant part, was telling her that it was demeaning to run after any man, be he king or not, be he even a god. But also demeaning to be left behind. The part of her which was in love, said that since even Minos didn't really seem to know why he was running in the first place, it was all right for her to run as well. Then again it had never thought very logically. And a yet third part of her mind, a part which was perhaps way too influenced by the griffins, was saying teasingly that chasing down your future mate was a fun and invigorating element of the courting process. So, with all three, angry pride, and annoyed love, and grim amusement, she pursued him. Another time. Another place. Four years ago. The pharaoh strained his eyes to look at the arrival. Then, ever so slowly, he smiled. \"Mehy...\" The man kneeled by the bed where the aged king was resting in the last days of his mortal life. \"No, my lord. Don't you remember? Mehy is no more -- I am his son.\" Pharaoh Seti stared at the ceiling. Then slowly he chuckled -- a broken sound. \"Mehy...\" he said again when he stopped laughing. \"Don't lie to a dying man.\" Minos was silent for a moment. \"I'm sorry,\" he said, and then he closed his eyes and changed. His youthful face became suddenly wrinkled and older -- his hair turned grey. \"Hello, my friend,\" he said. \"Ah!\" said the Pharaoh. \"There's the man I know.\" Mehy smiled. \"When did you find out?\" Seti made a gesture -- waved it away as inconsequential. \"Gradually. It doesn't matter.\" He coughed and leaned back on the pillow. \"As man I've loved you, \" he said, \"as god I've worshipped you. And I'm glad to see you one last time.\" \"Of the two, it was the man's love that I most valued,\" said Mehy. They were both silent for a long time. \"Goodbye, my friend,\" said the Pharaoh at last. \"May I see you again when Osiris returns to earth, taking with him all those worthy of his servants.\" \"Until we meet again,\" said Mehy. Seti didn't speak further -- he had closed his eyes and seemed to be sleeping. Mehy stood and turned to go. As he was leaving, he assumed again the youthful appearance of Minos. At the door he paused. \"Behold him, \" he whispered as if talking to himself, \"he comes to you without sin, without guilt, without evil, without a witness against him, without one against whom he has taken action.\" It was part ritual and part eulogy, and as such far more generous than accurate. But Minos's heart beat loudly as he spoke the words -- his voice cracked with emotion for his friend. For all the friends that he had lost or was still doomed to lose. \"He lives on truth and eats of truth. He has given bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty, clothing to the naked and a boat to him who could not cross the River.\" And now he departed from Kemetic custom -- and concluded with a prayer that only the gods spoke among themselves, the prayer which could be both curse and blessing: \"May Azrael be tender with you.\" And then she was on him. He had descended a steep hill while she, out of breath, hadn't even started hurrying down -- the bull's head turned to look at her. And then, knowing in her heart that this might be the last chance she got, she did the only thing she could think of and jumped onto him. How do you catch a god? You hold onto him. And you don't let go. And she was now riding the bull trying to stay on him -- a trick more dangerous than any leap she had attempted during the sport of bull-jumping. He can throw me off at any moment, a part of her mind was still able to think, and kill me with the simple force of his toss against the rocks. Let's just assume he won't. Instead of tossing her away, the bull simply run away at full gallop, and Pasiphae just held on with all her remaining strength. By the neck, by the horns, by the very hair on the bull's back, by any and every purchase that her hands could find. In front of her she could see a cliff coming up. The drop down to the sea below was far too steep for anyone to climb, yet the bull didn't seem to slow down -- didn't seem to even see the drop. The part of Pasiphae's mind which could still think, wondered whether beneath the bull's form there might now exist an equally bovine intelligence. No, she thought, for any bull would have tossed you off and killed you. Trust he won't kill you now, either. And the bull kept on running until he reached the cliff. And then he fell over it, Pasiphae still holding onto its neck, and this time no part of her mind was able to think coherently. And the bull changed. \"You were correct, then? About Minos?\" Laodamia asked her son. \"Yes,\" Sarpedon replied. Laodamia closed her eyes. A memory came unbidden to her mind -- herself of long ago, a young woman which Zeus himself was making love to. Unlike so many other women that the king of the gods had loved, it had not been deceit or force. It had been freely given and likewise received, as was fitting for the daughter of Bellerophon. So, she didn't feel loathing at the memory -- but she was still entitled to feel regret. She sighed. \"Poor Pasiphae. May she be able to accept the bitter alongside the sweet.\" How do you catch a god? Decades later, the same would be done by a man named Peleus -- capturing a goddess doomed to give birth to one greater than his father, and starting a thread of events which would eventually lead to the downfall of Troy. Millennia later, a young woman named Janet would manage, in the same way, to claim and win her lover from the Queen of Faerie herself. You hold onto them. They'll change into different shapes and forms, they'll become beasts and monsters within your grasp. They'll turn into fire and burn you, or ice and freeze you. You'll feel their tremendous power as you hold them, and you'll know that they could kill you in an instant. You'll get scared. You'll want to let go. Don't. Trust they won't hurt you. Surrender yourself fully to their power. Your weakness is your only advantage. She had closed her eyes against the fall. She opened them at the sound of wings. He was now Horus the Elder, the hawk-headed god. His feathered wings beat behind him, even as she held on from his neck. In the past she had let herself be carried by sphinxes. But this creature was no sphinx and the experience was wholly different -- with the sphinxes (whether it was Leader or Golden) she was carried in their arms, and held on to them herself. The sphinxes had to glide on the currents of the wind and most ascents were slow and steady. And you also knew that behind the eyes of the sphinxes there existed a friendly humanlike mind which wouldn't let you fall. But now they were ascending almost vertically with the steady beat of the god's wings, and she held onto him desperately. And they kept on ascending until she started wondering whether they'd rise so high that she's be burned by the flame of the sun, like wax melts under too hot a fire. And then Horus started glowing. He was a solar deity and as such he glowed as bright as the sun at high noon. Even with her eyes shut the blinding brightness pained her as it pierced her skull. But she held on. He changed. He now turned into a full hawk, but of huge size, and swooped down to the earth. But she held on. And then they were back on the earth. He changed. He was now a gigantic bull-headed man who ran and thrashed around, but she clung from his neck with all her strength. He changed. Back into the full form of bull he turned, and she was still on his back. She held on. It was part wrestling, and part courtship. And suddenly it was over. He was back in human form, naked in her arms. And he was looking at her smiling. \"You are stubborn,\" he said. \"And I am conquered.\" And then, in the form of a man, and in the form of a bull, and in an infinite number of forms in between, he made love to her. The sun set and they awoke, stone fragments flying from their bodies. And the golden-skinned sphinx wept for joy. \"I thought I'd lost you...\" The grey boy in her arms smiled at her and passed a hand over her brow-ridges. \"I thought I...\" she said again but suddenly knew she couldn't continue. She just leaned her head on his chest for a long minute. And then she turned and looked at him, and her expression was different from any she ever had before. It was the red Leader who had advised Creon to ensure their privacy when they next awoke. \"They may have things to talk about,\" she had simply told him. Very little talking took place. It wasn't as either of them had ever expected it to be. It wasn't that passionate. It wasn't carefree. It was a bit awkward, and neither of them had been prepared. But it was tender. And it was theirs. And that would for the moment suffice. And when they had ended and they rested in each other's arms, Pasiphae, exhausted, slept. And then she awoke and he was still by her side, holding her in his arms, and they had a long talk about all the things that Minos had hidden from her, and about his long life. Well... not about all the things. That would have required years of storytelling. But about most of the important things concerning him. Some of them, anyway. And then, half-jokingly, they decided to choose a name. \"If it's a boy, I was thinking 'Lycastus'.\" Pasiphae smiled at him. \"Lycastus, son of Minos, son-in-law of Lycastus, son of Minos? Bad idea.\" Minos laughed. \"Then... Asterius.\" Pasiphae nodded, slowly. \"I think I like the sound of that. Asterius.\" But at that moment Minos shuddered and he somehow knew that this wouldn't be the name that their firstborn son would be widely known with. There will be a price to pay. 1275 BCE: Prices and Punishments Knossos \"Hail the rising Sun, hail the new Moon! Hail the King and Queen, Minos and Pasiphae!\" They were married the very same day that Minos was crowned king of Crete; and the two celebrations were merged into one. Both Sarpedon and Rhadamanthys had withdrawn their own claims for the kingship in favour of Minos, and in public all three swore brotherhood and loyalty to each other. And then as the darkest part of the night approached, Minos and Pasiphae sneaked away, supposedly to their bedroom -- in reality away from the city and to the mountains. There they partook into yet a third celebration, smaller perhaps but no less joyful, where two young sphinxes exchanged their mating oaths before the clan. \"Hello, old friend. You aren't dancing.\" Minos didn't turn. \"It's a dance of youth.\" From his vantage point on the hill, he looked down at the many sphinx (and one human) forms, male and female, that were dancing under the light of the moon. Pasiphae was also there -- fulfilling a promise that she had made a while ago. \"It's a long time since I felt young,\" he said. The Leader sat down beside him. King Minos let his hand pass lightly over the walls, as he passed through the corridors of the palace. The Old Palace, that is. He had entertained brief notions to have it restored, to return the center of the island's government to where it had once been. But the old Palace contained now too many ugly memories for the people; and evil superstitions as well, not all of which were necessarily untrue. So, that plan would have to wait for another time if ever. Besides, there were too many other things that required doing, much more urgent and much more important. First of all, he'd have to arrange for a journey throughout the whole of Crete, see the real needs himself-- \"Hey, Minos! There you are.\" He smiled but didn't turn around. \"Haven't seen you in a while.\" Golden grinned at him. \"I was rather... busy these last few weeks.\" Minos stopped himself from barking a laughter. He cleared his throat. \"Ahem. Yes. I can imagine. Stuff to think about, stuff to do...\" \"My daughter tells me that you knew she'd be mated with her rookery brother even before she herself knew it. Within the year, you said.\" He smiled. \"I had thought it too risky to say a month. Foolish of me -- I should have said a week.\" She also smiled, crookedly. \"In this past week they have been going at each other like sex-crazed rabbits. It's like a unending mating season for them two. Can't get them to think about anything else.\" Minos chuckled. \"And she used to blush even at the idea of mating! Pasiphae wondered why they forgot to come to our own wedding.\" \"I don't think I ever had so much passion.\" \"I don't think I ever had so much love.\" \"The best of both worlds in our offspring.\" A long moment passed in silence. \"You wear clothes,\" Minos observed. \"Which means you didn't come here just for me or Pasiphae.\" Golden grinned. \"Do you have any idea how perverse that sounded?\" Minos didn't reply, just looked at her gravely, and she also became serious. \"I also came to talk to Coeranus. I'll be taking up his offer.\" He stopped walking and turned to face her, looking deep into her eyes. \"To learn magic.\" Golden nodded, smiling gently. \"I thought you had practically forgotten about that. That you'd want to spend all your time with your clan. With your mate. Magic--\" \"Magic can't do everything. You've told me that before, Minos.\" \"I have.\" \"Magic can't bring love. Magic can't bring joy.\" She clenched her fists. \"It can't.\" \"But magic brought my boy back from death's threshold, Minos. So, when you tell me these things, I can only conclude that you are an idiot.\" Her voice was now trembling with emotion. He touched her on the forearm, and she suddenly started crying. \"Thank you, thank you...\" she kept saying. He hugged her and kissed her forehead. \"It's all right.\" \"You saved him. I can never thank you enough.\" I almost killed you both. I can never forgive myself for that. For that and for many other things. \"Yes, old friend,\" she continued at last. \"I know. I always knew, even that very night. I don't believe that the spirits of the dead travel back to the living; certainly not for reasons of lust. So, whether it was a god, or a dream, or a delusion of madness -- I always knew that it was not my love.\" \"I... used you.\" \"And I used you.\" \"I took your dead mate's form. I used you.\" \"You did what you wanted. But also what I needed. You allowed me to share in the pain of birth. Gave me one more daughter to take joy in.\" \"It was inexcusable.\" She smiled bitterly. \"My daughter will never treat you as anything other than a friend or older brother -- even if you tell her this. Consider it punishment enough.\" She stood up and gazed at the moon. Another long silence. After a while, they broke the embrace and he wiped her remaining tears with his hand. She smiled up at him. \"Pasiphae's with egg, isn't she?\" \"Pregnant. Humans call it 'pregnant'. Yes, she is.\" Minos could sense it before even Pasiphae herself could. Before the first hint of a heartbeat, the pulse of magic already flowed inside her, revealing the child's partial divinity. It'd be a boy. Asterius. And Golden also sensed it somehow. Coeranus had been right: She did have talent. \"It feels weird. She's almost like a rookery sister to me. And she'll be a mother already. Is she ready?\" \"Are you ready?\" he asked in turn. \"You'll be yourself with egg in less than two years,\" he reminded her. She made a face. \"But I won't be a mother for another ten, Minos! I have a while, yet!\" \"Of course. I'm sorry.\" She bit her lips, hesitating. \"Don't be. It's twelve years away and I'm already terrified with the prospect.\" Minos laughed -- and Golden also did so nervously. \"You'll be a fine mother,\" he said at last, ruffling her hair. \"Your children will really love you, my lady.\" Golden blushed, but managed to giggle nonetheless. \"You've never before called me 'my lady'.\" Minos smiled. \"You've never before looked so grown-up.\" Grinning, she leaned closer. \"You know something? Neither have you.\" Minos laughed. \"You may be r--\" And then he felt it. And he froze. \"My lady...\" he whispered, his eyes not on her. \"Go. There's... someone coming.\" She looked at him quizzically, but he turned and looked at her intensely. \"Scram! Now!\" She obeyed. He went to the stone throne and waited. It was Minos who spoke in the end, slowly and with eyes on the ground. \"You will die. So will our daughter. And Pasiphae. And our unborn child. And I will have to live on and see it all happen.\" \"Poor little you.\" He raised his head, angry for the first time -- but though her words had been sarcastic, her look was one of compassion. Straining himself he smiled. \"So you haven't completely forgiven me.\" \"I guess I'm not perfect after all.\" She extended a hand. \"Come, old friend. For our children's sake.\" He let himself be carried down. And then they joined the dance together, old friends, old lovers, half-human god and sacred beast. Half-human means half-divine. Half-anything means a hybrid, a bastard, an outcast. One who belongs to both and thus belongs to neither. A creature of two natures and more than one name. Minos awaited. It could not be seen, it could not be heard, it could not be smelled or touched. But nonetheless he felt it with the sense of the gods -- a rip across the worlds. A doorway was opening from the Blessed Isle. There will be a price to pay. Minos wondered who would be the one to come. A grim mood made him desire Raguel as the emissary. He had enough cold hatred for him and his entire pantheon that he'd not avoid a confrontation, no matter what it might cost him. And then his thoughts abruptly, irrationally, leaped to another, to Mithras -- to Mithras and the willing Sacrifice of the Divine Bull -- and he shuddered as he knew that there was at least one god that he did not want to face. But neither his desire nor his fear was to be -- when he heard the voice, he immediately knew who had been sent. \"Hail, hail, responsible trickster.\" The words, the sound; they were almost, almost, verging on the affection of a Grace. But he knew full well, and so did they, that this was not the role they had come to fulfil. \"Hail, hail, oh servant king!\" The impartiality, the ambiguity, the arrogance of a Fate. But fate was his and theirs to make: They might like to disguise their deeds with the sham named 'fate'. He would not. \"Hail, hail, half-human bastard son of Nut!\" And with that the Sisters, the Furies, appeared. He nodded. \"Greetings, nieces.\" They surrounded him. \"You've broken Hyperion's law.\" \"You flatter me. Am I that powerful?\" \"No god shall become a king of mortals.\" \"I already was, once. So none became.\" \"No god shall interfere with mortal kind.\" Minos glared at the one in front of him. \"You've addressed me, Hekate's daughter, and named my species; and you didn't call me god. Say that I'm not.\" In his mind the godly race had kicked him out a long time ago. He still had two sisters and the memory of brothers; he still had a family of sorts. But he had no species. They smiled, predatorily. He felt them closing in. \"You said it,\" they chorused, and at that moment he knew what his punishment would be; and he felt cold inside. Hyperion had never forgiven him. He attacked first. And he could see his loved ones; generations of them stretching in front of him, like the ocean before a shore. Many and beautiful, they'd live and give birth, and build, and die; and when he himself was forgotten, the memories of them would live on. And he thought, \"They shall do so many things that I will never get to see. I should have never loved them.\" And he wept. \"Minos!\" Golden ran to the fallen man. She had left when he had ordered her away; but before she had glided far, she sensed more than she heard the battle that was taking place. She hurried back as fast as she could. She couldn't have possibly helped, so it was a blessing that she arrived when all had ended. \"Minos!\" He groaned, and blinked his eyes, then slowly pulled himself up into a sitting position. The sphinx-girl searched him for wounds. She could find none -- but still... there was something wrong here. \"You can sense it, can't you?\" Minos asked her, smiling sadly. She could sense something, but she didn't know what it was: It felt as if Minos himself had... changed. But she didn't see or hear or smell or touch anything different on him... \"You are sensing that I cannot sense,\" he didn't explain, \"ever again. \" And Minos, fully mortal, stood up and walked away on unsteady feet. 1274 BCE: Epilogue -- Decisions and Constraints Mount Dicte, Crete The man carefully placed his offering among the coals of the small altar in front of the cave, then stepped back. It would burn quickly; soon nothing would be left but ashes scattering in the wind. Now there was just one more thing left to be done here. Slowly, with his newborn son in his arms, he began ascending the slope of the mountain. My name is Minos. It wasn't my first name -- far before I ever was Minos, I was Hierax and Min and Horus and many other names. But it is going to be my last; the only one that will matter from now on. I'm writing this letter, as a sort of promise to myself. I'm writing this to you, my son, but you are never going to read it. If I live long enough, my doings shall fulfil my words and make this letter redundant. If, on the other hand, Azrael calls me soon, another shall make the choices that will decide your destiny and the letter will be useless. \"Diktynna!\" he called as he climbed. \"Diktynna Britomartis!\" There was no answer of course. He hadn't expected any. He was mortal now; and few gods would ever appear to a mortal because they were simply called by name -- even in such a place. \"Zeus! Storm-god!\" he called once more. Again no answer. But inwardly he smiled. That nobody answered didn't mean that nobody was listening. Or that no one would pay attention. I am now fully human. Fully mortal. I expected punishment, but never guessed how quickly it'd come or how severe. Hyperion's to blame for the latter -- he doesn't easily forgive disobedience. As for the former... I suspect Poseidon. He is even more petty. It doesn't matter. I am now fully human... More mortal than Golden or even Pasiphae. Indistinguishable from other humans. But you will not be. He climbed on. The first time he had been here, the first time he had climbed these slopes, the place had been nameless; unremarked and unremarkable. That was after all the very reason it had been chosen. It would never again so be so considered. A god, a king of gods, had once been born here, and the downfall of another was begun. The place was sacred. The place was powerful. Even the humans could sense it, or at least the most gifted among their kind. He himself couldn't, not anymore. And though once again he hadn't expected anything different, he couldn't help but feel pain at the realisation. But inside his arms, the small baby's breath was slow -- its eyes wide open and its tiny body seemed tense with rapt attention. The child was sensing what the father no longer could. You were conceived when I was still a god. You were conceived when I had the form of a bull. You are far from the first one who has been likewise conceived: gods mate in a plethora of forms. There are centaurs, and fauns, and mermaids to declare the truth of this. But always, always, the only children who retained in their forms any sign of their mixed heritage, were those whose divine parents didn't know them, didn't care about them. For all others there was no problem: they would be transformed back into human form as soon as they were born -- or even before. A deity could perhaps see beneath the disguise -- a wizard might sense something vaguely wrong. But no one else would ever know. You... and me... will be the exception. I know about you, and care about you, and love you. But I have no more magic to transform you into human. And no other god, friend or foe, will be allowed to do it for me. You can never be king. You can never even be human. My deeds have deprived you of either. And lest my deeds also take away your life, I'll have to partially deprive you of your freedom as well. Soon after your birth, you will have to go and stay in the old palace. And as far as I can guess you will never be able to openly leave it. He remembered well the first time he had been here, the dance he had participated in. He remembered the fire of his anger, the ice of his hate, the emptiness of his grief. He remembered well the child Zeus feeding on the milk of Amalthea. The Storm-god - how strongly power flowed through him! He was the fulfillment of their hopes; he was their avenger. He remembered the bright blue eyes. Many of Zeus's children had the same eyes. Athena did. So did poor Zagreus; brief though his life had been by the count of the gods. Sarpedon also. And as he thought of the Lycian he smiled in grief. The blue-eyed man had left Crete. Summoned back to his own land, to take up the throne after the death of his uncle Isander in the struggle against the Solymi. So Sarpedon would also be a king, the warrior king that his people required at the time. As for Rhadamanthys, he went back to Phaestos; but Minos openly referred and treated him as the vice-ruler of the entire island. He'd be a good ruler and judge of his people: For he had many advisors, both ready and eager to help him with the tasks of leadership -- but there was no one among them whose judgement he trusted more than his own. If it only made decisions easier -- to know that there's no one else who can decide on your behalf! You may not understand this. You may hate me. You are free to do so - wholeheartedly I accept it. But there's no other place where you will be able to live in as much relative comfort. Your birth can't remain a secret, and there's no nation or people who will be able to accept you as one of them. You have no species. You are a new species. The old palace will be your home. Your mansion. Your prison. I will instruct Daedalus and he shall so modify it so that for you it will be a rich dwelling, but anyone else who enters it will encounter nothing other than a maze. He'll manage to do it. You'll have friends which will come from the sphinxes, and those people of Creon who can be trusted, and any siblings you may later have. As for enemies... I'll try to ensure that you won't have any enemies either. That though the Cretans will fear you, they will also respect you and admire the divine power seen through your continuing existence. In short, I'll turn you into a symbol. You are free to hate me for that as well. I deserve it. Minos pulled himself up. He hadn't reached the mountain's peak; but neither would he try to do so. He wasn't certain he could climb further without risking the child's safety. This far was enough. A wind was blowing - a wind which would blow the ashes of the burned letter throughout the island and beyond. Minos smiled grimly. If anyone had seen, they could think that he had destroyed it, left it to be consumed by the fire. But it all depended on one's point of view. It hadn't been destroyed. It had been taken to a place where no hand could unwrite it. Let it feed the fires there, let it feed the flame within. And now, only one thing was left to be done. He smiled down at the child. The calf-headed baby smiled back at him. I will make up a story that shall give me the blame for your form; and as such be as true as possible for the people to understand. I don't want any of them to think that Pasiphae is the one being punished by the gods with this birth. Pasiphae... I love Pasiphae. But as always, I love her less than she loves me. Yet when I tell her all this, Pasiphae will surely hate me, hate me five times more than she ever loved me. Hate me for your form, hate me for your confinement. I fear the ice of her hate, more than I remember fearing anything before. I can only hope it'll melt before it slays me. Don't worry, though. You she'll love, regardless of form. As will I. Are you watching, Britomartis? Are you here, Storm-god Zeus? Poseidon? Hyperion? All of you. Hear me. From such a place, he could have once raised such a voice that would echo throughout the worlds, a voice that would perforce be heard by all who had ears to listen. Now, even here, his voice would be nothing more than a whisper. But still... it would travel far enough. If nothing else it would be heard by him. He lifted the baby high. Something more. An afterthought. The sphinxes have it wrong in a sense -- and completely correct in another: Names are important. Names define us. Not by telling us who we are, but by telling how we are perceived. By others, or by ourselves. I don't know how the people will name you. Something evil probably, something ugly. It is beyond my power to control. But I want you to remember that you already have a name, given you in love and not in fear or hatred or even awe. I want you to use it for yourself, for it will be the name used by all who love you. Remember it well. \"HIS NAME IS ASTERIUS!\" he cried out in defiance, for all to hear, men and gods. And all the infinite forms in between. THE END",

      "\"Then I'm glad that now I can do both at the same time,\" Minos said, giving back to Pasiphae his own cup.",
      "\"I've seen very few people with your skill in the sport.\"",
      "Pasiphae gave him a strange look, perhaps searching his words for honesty.",
      "At the end she simply shrugged, perhaps figuring out that since it was true that she was one of the best, he'd have no reason to lie no matter his intentions.",
      "Lycastus spoke again.",
      "\"And of the land?\"",
      "\"Well, I've just arrived in Crete a few days ago, my lord.",
      "But the land is fertile and the palaces both here and in Phaestos are magnificent.",
      "Everyone can see that it's a land that has been blessed by gods.\"",
      "Lycastus thoughtfully laid his cup down.",
      "\"Three gifts.",

      "Pasiphae gasped, and Minos couldn't help but also feel surprised.",
      "To show him one of Crete's greatest treasures, to him who just arrived there as guest...",
      "\"To say that you honour me is an understatement, lord.\"",
      "Lycastus ignored it.",

      "\"He really likes you, you know,\" said Pasiphae, the next day, as they rode with a small escort for the old estates.",
      "\"I know,\" he replied simply.",
      "\"I never intended it, though.\"",
      "Pasiphae laughed.",
      "\"It's true!\"",
      "he objected.",
      "\"My goal was never to appeal to noblemen.",
      "I generally find it far more efficient to serve people who don't mind honesty.\"",
      "Pasiphae raised an eyebrow.",
      "\"I can't believe that Ramesses or his father would go for it.\"",
      "\"You'd be surprised,\" Minos mused.",
      "\"My father, Mehy, was a great friend of Seti.",
      "He didn't mind the honesty of friends.",
      "As for Ramesses...\" \"Yes?\"",
      "\"... why do you think he sent me away?\" Pasiphae stopped her horse startled.",
      "Minos likewise stopped.",
      "\"I read the letter that Ramesses sent to my father,\" she said.",
      "\"It said that the services of you and your father to Egypt were many and that Egypt was grateful for them.",
      "It certainly didn't seem like he was exiling you.\"",
      "Minos smiled.",
      "\"Ah... yes.",
      "But his real message was of course 'keep him, keep him, we don't want him.'",
      "Shall we go on, lady?\" Pasiphae, skeptical, spurred her horse onward.",
      "Minos and the guards followed.",
      "They all rode in silence for a while.",
      "\"What do you think of the gods, Minos?\" she said at last apropos of nothing.",
      "He was surprised.",
      "\"Why do you ask?\"",
      "\"Last night...",
      "Your name...",
      "My father's words...\" She shook her head.",
      "\"He truly considers me a gift of the Sun-god,\" she said finally, her voice more steady.",
      "\"My mother -- she lost two children, born prematurely or dead, before she had me.",
      "My parents went to pray in the temple of Helius and...",
      "Well, let's say they attributed my coming to him.\"",
      "She sighed.",
      "\"And then again there's the stories about my great-grandmother.\"",
      "\"Europa.\"",
      "\"Europa,\" she agreed.",
      "\"She came out of Phoenicia riding a great white bull -- they say it was a disguised god, perhaps even Zeus himself.",
      "And that her child, my grandfather, your namesake Minos, was not by Asterius, but by the king of the gods.\"",
      "\"And what do you believe, my lady?\"",
      "\"No,\" she said, \"what do you think, my lord?",
      "Am I a descendant of the gods?\"",
      "He was the one to stop his horse now.",
      "He thought for a moment, his gaze downcast.",
      "He finally raised his head again.",
      "\"My lady, please approach.\"",
      "She led her horse next to his.",
      "He smiled for a moment, then startled her as he suddenly leaned over and whispered in her ear.",
      "\"The gods are petty, my lady.",
      "The gods are small.",
      "For every Prometheus, how many Heras do we have?",
      "For every Athena, how many Areses?\"",
      "He sat back straight again and now spoke in a normal voice.",
      "\"I think you are fully human.",
      "I think that the sun-god has no idea you even exist.",
      "Take pride in that.",
      "Shall we go on?\"",
      "She hesitantly nodded.",
      "They rode in silence for the remainder of the journey.",
      "\"Away, intruders!\"",
      "The middle-aged balding man was bravely waving a spear at their direction.",
      "Pasiphae seemed surprised and the two guards moved forward ready to intervene.",
      "But Minos laughed it off.",
      "\"This is Pasiphae, old man.",
      "The daughter of the king, I'm sure you've heard.\"",
      "The man was undaunted.",
      "\"And these are the estates of Hierax under my care, by order of the king, as I'm sure you've heard.",
      "So only the king, or the gods, or Hierax himself can remove my guardianship.\"",
      "\"Or his heir, my man.\"",
      "He slowly removed his ring.",
      "\"I am his heir, Minos, son of Mehy, son of Hierax, and this ring is the arranged token as my grandfather said to yours when you were but a child.\"",
      "He threw it to him, a glint of gold tumbling in a high arc.",
      "The man caught it effortlessly, his expression still skeptical.",
      "Then he squinted down at the ring and saw the emblem inscribed on it -- a pyramid with a single Eye blazing out of its apex.",
      "He lowered the spear but didn't seem to relax.",
      "He stuttered briefly and seemed helpless as he looked around.",
      "Other people had started to gather by now and Pasiphae couldn't hold back her annoyance.",
      "\"My lord,\" she said addressed to Minos, but looking directly at the man, \"I am the princess of this land, and you the owner of these estates.",
      "If these slaves don't welcome you at once, I advise that we all return swiftly and bring my father's army to clear them away.\"",
      "She expected fear; she expected them to submit.",
      "What she did not expect was the cold anger that appeared on the man's face and his irresolution seeming to melt away as he half raised the spear again.",
      "And while she suddenly grew afraid she also couldn't help but be surprised at Minos' reaction: for as the guards once again moved forward, he turned towards them lightning fast with a glare.",
      "\"Leave,\" he said quietly but with a hint of menace.",
      "Minos spoke again.",
      "\"Leave.",
      "Your task was to ensure the lady's safety in the journey.",
      "Leave.\"",
      "She tried to interrupt.",
      "\"My lord--\" But Minos would have none of that.",
      "\"I'll ask, my lady, that you send your men away from these estates.",
      "You are invited to remain here, of course, as long as you wish.\"",
      "Pasiphae was silent in thought.",
      "He was not afraid...?",
      "She was intrigued.",
      "\"Tell my father that I'll return on my own,\" she said to the guards.",
      "\"Leave.\"",
      "After a few more objections they finally left and Pasiphae turned towards Minos again.",
      "\"My lord--\" Once again he interrupted her.",
      "\"These are not slaves,\" he commented gently, but the hardness of his eyes hadn't left.",
      "\"This is as much their home as mine, or more so, for decades now ever since their old lord gave them their freedom before departing.\"",
      "He turned now towards the gathering people, his voice loud.",
      "\"My ancestor made an agreement with you, did he not?",
      "You'll hold this land as long as you won't deny it.",
      "You'll get the help of his heirs, as long as you so accept it.",
      "His heirs will be worthy of trust, as long as you trust them.",
      "And this bond will hold, as long as you keep the other bond -- the one between this household and Hierax's old friends.\"",
      "The people now murmured among themselves in surprise, but the old man was still uncertain.",
      "Pasiphae prepared to speak again, when surprised once again she saw Minos get off the horse.",
      "He waved away the spear with a hand, and placed the other on the servant's shoulder.",
      "\"My friend, by your courage you've proven your bond still holds.",
      "The bond of my family stands as well.",
      "I've been a friend of the sphinxes all of my life.\"",
      "There was a sigh, a release: The tension melted away and the man lowered the spear.",
      "\"My apologies, lord.",
      "Come in, and join us eating.\"",
      "Four griffins were inside, their majestic forms captivated in their daytime stone forms.",
      "While eating, Pasiphae couldn't help but glance at them every so often.",
      "There were two larger males, one whose wavery hair seemed almost to surround him like a lion's mane, the other completely bald and both taller and thinner.",
      "There were also two children: One was what seemed to be a young girl (she can't be more than fourteen she estimated) seemingly frozen while laughing.",
      "On her shoulders an even younger boy (two?",
      "three?) was caught pulling a strand of the girl's hair.",
      "All of them had feathered wings, and hands and feet that seemed to be a cross between a lion's paws and human members.",
      "And all of them were completely naked.",
      "\"Creon did suggest, my lady,\" Minos whispered in her ear, \"that a piece of cloth be put over them but I said you wouldn't mind their nudity.\"",
      "To her horror she felt herself blushing.",
      "\"It's not that, my lord,\" she said quickly to remove the grin from his face.",
      "\"I was wondering about the people here.",
      "I'd never imagined...\" she waved her hands around vaguely.",
      "\"Aren't these people afraid?\" she whispered back to him.",
      "Minos shook his head.",
      "\"They were worried, my lady, that they'd fail their guests.",
      "That we'd hate the griffins and bring in the army to smash them.",
      "And that they'd fail thus of their bond.\"",
      "He emptied his cup and laid it aside.",
      "\"Sphinxes come in a hundred different forms -- and a thousand different names.",
      "In Egypt it's not sphinx but shesepankh, the living statue.",
      "Gryphon is properly the name for only those among them whose heads are eagle-like -- though it's often used for all.",
      "Up north they are harpies -- certainly not the kindest of names.",
      "Far better is the one they have among the Babylonians and the Hebrews: there they are the Cherubim.",
      "\"But they are all equally sphinxes, no matter the name or form.",
      "And sphinxes protect, my lady.",
      "Yet even more than that, they often need protection.",
      "My family has protected and been protected by sphinxes for centuries.\"",
      "Creon -- the man who had first met them -- sat down next to them.",
      "\"This is their clan's Second-in-command,\" he said indicating the one with the mane.",
      "\"The other is a mentor for their younger generations.",
      "It's a long story, but a couple of years ago the young boy was... lost and in danger.",
      "While the rest of the clan was searching for the child in the woods, the sphinx-girl had the idea to come and recruit our help instead.",
      "Obviously we eventually found him.",
      "Since then and every so often, some sphinxes come for visits -- though it's usually just the girl and a rookery brother of hers.\"",
      "\"Lady Pasiphae is anxious to talk to them, Creon,\" said Minos.",
      "She looked at him with a mixture of amazement and horror, and Creon turned his gaze towards her in obvious wonder and doubt.",
      "\"You are, my lady?\"",
      "Her surprise turned suddenly to anger.",
      "Did Minos and this servant think she'd be afraid of the sphinxes or any other monster?",
      "Was Minos making fun of her?",
      "\"Yes,\" she said looking directly at Minos, daring him to contradict her but Minos didn't react.",
      "\"Yes, I am.",
      "I've never talked to sphinxes before, and I look forward to it.",
      "You'll introduce them to me.",
      "What are their names?\" Creon hesitated.",
      "\"They don't have names of their own,\" he said at last.",
      "\"Call them Second, Teacher, Girl and Boy if you'd like.",
      "Or White, Grey, Golden and Blue.",
      "Or nothing at all.\"",
      "Minos finally spoke again.",
      "\"But not monsters.",
      "Of all their names that's the one they resent the most -- almost as much as the free resent being called slaves.\"",
      "Her anger vanished as fast as it had come.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" she said and Creon nodded.",
      "\"She's not as bad as I first thought, my lord,\" Creon said a few hours later.",
      "\"She's uncomfortable but she's getting the hang of it.\"",

      "\"No, she isn't,\" Minos agreed full-heartedly.",
      "\"She's a bit arrogant, but not spoiled.",

      "It's not too late for her to learn.\"",
      "Creon moved away and Minos was left with his thoughts.",
      "It had been a good two days, he thought, and couldn't help but smile.",
      "He had already made friends of the king and his daughter, enemies of a lord, renewed the alliance with this household and with the griffins.",
      "He looked on as Boy now pulled with a fierce yank the long hair of Pasiphae, who startled gave off a short scream, lost her balance and fell down before she laughed realising what had happened.",
      "And he had also helped a princess start getting over her petty, if few, prejudices.",
      "Yes, it was a good two days indeed.",
      "He was home.",

      "Laelaps (that was the name that Creon had given to the strange beast), was the only sphinx-hound to his knowledge which remained flesh throughout the day.",
      "Neither Creon nor any of the sphinxes knew how that happened or why -- they hypothesised that the beast might be in part divine.",
      "Reaching the top, Minos sat down on the grass (with barely a glance at the statue by his side) and waited patiently watching the sun go lower and lower on the horizon.",
      "When it set, he heard a great roar beside him as Golden awoke.",
      "\"Uh",
      ", where was I?",
      "Oh, yes.",

      "What are you going to do?\"",
      "Swiftly Golden plopped herself next to Minos and held her chin in her hands, her face becoming troubled.",
      "\"Eh... I don't know.",
      "I mean I'll have to spend more time on the city, which means less time with my clan, and less time free for hunting or fishing (why can't Coeranus live in the mountains anyway?",
      "I asked but he said no) and less time--\" \"--less time spent with that cute griffin-boy I constantly see you with.\"",
      "Golden blushed for a moment but wouldn't let herself be stopped.",
      "\"Eh, yeah that too.",
      "And I'll have to learn how to read, (and what's the need for that I don't know), and Coeranus tells me that he won't have me around naked so if I want to learn magic I'll have to wear clothes, can you believe it?\" Minos laughed loud.",
      "He didn't know the new magician very well and hadn't trusted his motives.",
      "He was a bit more relieved now -- hardly completely assured but a bit more so than earlier.",
      "\"I'd follow his advice if I were you,\" he said still laughing.",

      "It doesn't bring joy, it doesn't bring success, it doesn't bring love.",
      "It doesn't preclude them, but it doesn't bring them either.\"",
      "\"I know,\" she said but seemed not to believe it entirely.",
      "\"Beyond that I can tell you little more.",
      "Magic can bring knowledge, sometimes.",
      "And some small power perhaps.",

      "Now, scram.",
      "I think there's someone coming.\"",
      "She nodded, still orange from embarrassment, and glided away from the hill, Laelaps following her along the ground.",

      "\"How did he die, Xenia?\"",
      "She sighed.",
      "\"His heart gave out soon into the banquet.",
      "As always, he poured out the first of the wine to the gods -- but soon afterwards he clutched his arm and fell.",

      "Same with the wineskin.",
      "That leaves the cup itself but he had drained it and no strange scent remained -- if one had ever existed.",

      "Sarpedon, lord of the Lycians, slept.",
      "There was once an unimportant cave in an insignificant mountain on an unremarkable island.",
      "That was the very reason it had been chosen.",
      "Secretly, quietly they had started arriving in many different shapes.",
      "The old woman welcomed them -- some she bid into the cave so as to help the pregnant goddess -- others she asked to remain outside.",
      "\"Are you sure you are strong enough to do this?",
      "Only recently you gave birth to Three,\" the old woman -- a goddess herself, Sarpedon suddenly realised -- asked a newcomer.",
      "The girl -- Sarpedon had never before seen a more beautiful woman -- nodded.",
      "Her skin was pale but her long hair was darker than Night itself and her black eyes were stars.",
      "\"Aset was my sister-in-the-soul.",
      "I'll help avenge her murderer.",
      "I'm strong enough.\"",
      "The old woman's eyes fell on the even younger boy -- no more than ten, thought Sarpedon -- that was holding the girl's hand.",
      "The boy stared back angrily.",
      "\"And she was my best friend.\"",
      "A smile full of sadness.",
      "\"She used to call me insufferable.",
      "I won't be left out.\"",
      "\"How many have gathered, Grandmother?",
      "Are we enough?\" asked the girl.",
      "Another woman stepped suddenly from the cave and suddenly both the girl and the boy felt joy as they recognised her by the single feather on her hair.",
      "\"Metis!\"",
      "\"We are enough,\" the goddess of truth and wisdom said and smiled.",
      "\"And we must begin.\"",
      "They all held hands, Metis and the dark-haired boy and the beautiful girl and the old woman and all the others who had come for this occasion.",
      "And they danced.",
      "Round and round they went, round the cave, round the mountain, with loud music and singing voices and the beat of bare feet against grass and rock.",
      "But besides the music and the voices, beyond what mortal senses could perceive, they all wove their magic, magic which would be believed insignificant -- believed to be the reasonable excess magic which was the outcome of any such festivity.",
      "But which would serve to hide the magic that was taking place inside, to cover up the birth of Zeus.",
      "Sarpedon opened his eyes as the captain of the ship shook him gently.",
      "\"We are entering the haven of Miletus, lord,\" said the captain.",
      "Sarpedon rose and shakily went to the prow.",
      "He could feel there was something wrong here.",
      "He was certain about it but couldn't put it into words.",
      "\"Father... what's going on?\" he whispered.",
      "And his dream... it hadn't been a dream, he was certain of it.",
      "As he stepped off the ship he saw his mother awaiting him on the dock.",
      "And looking at her he somehow knew what was wrong.",
      "\"I understand now.",
      "It wasn't a dream.",
      "But this is one.\"",
      "The image of his mother looked surprised but nodded.",
      "\"Are you ready to be a king?\" she -it- asked.",
      "Sarpedon looked at her.",
      "\"I think so,\" he said at last.",
      "\"Why do you ask?\"",
      "She folded her arms and spoke without emotion.",
      "\"King Lycastus is dead.\"",
      "He stared for a moment.",
      "\"How?\"",
      "The shade ignored him.",
      "\"What are you going to do?\"",
      "He thought for a while, then shrugged.",
      "\"I hadn't expected to be doing this for another couple of years.",
      "But I'll vie for the kingship of course.\"",
      "The world vanished.",
      "Sarpedon woke up -- he knew it was for real this time.",
      "A falcon was watching him and he stared at it intently until it decided to leave, out of embarrassment perhaps.",
      "\"How far from Miletus, captain?\" he asked.",
      "\"Less than half an hour.\"",
      "Sarpedon nodded.",
      "And shivered.",
      "There was something going on here and he didn't like it.",
      "He'd find out what it was, though.",
      "He'd find out.",
      "Minos didn't sleep that night.",
      "Daylight found him staring outside his window in contemplation.",
      "He didn't turn as the door opened and closed behind him.",
      "Pasiphae hugged him softly from behind and leaned her head against him.",
      "He kissed gently one of her hands, then lifted her off her feet and placed her on the room's bed.",
      "He kneeled by its side.",
      "\"Have you slept at all?\" he asked her.",
      "She shook her head weakly.",
      "\"No. I couldn't.",
      "I didn't want to, anyway.\"",
      "He found nothing to say except...",
      "\"I am sorry.\"",
      "Her voice was but a whisper.",
      "\"Make love to me.\"",
      "He kissed her on the forehead then shook his head.",
      "\"No.",
      "Today it'd feel as if I was using you.\"",
      "Suddenly she grew furious and grabbing a pillow swung it around and hit him wildly time and again with it.",
      "\"I would be using you, you courteous fool!\"",
      "He tried to stop her gently and succeeded to get a hold on her hands but only for Pasiphae to yank on him and pull him onto the bed as well.",
      "He smiled softly and looked at her.",
      "\"Then I wouldn't be used that way.",
      "Not even by you.",
      "Not even today,\" he said as he wiped off Pasiphae's tears with the back of his hand.",
      "She turned towards him.",
      "Her next words shocked him.",
      "\"I'll never marry you,\" she said softly.",
      "Minos just stared for a moment.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "She gulped.",
      "\"Sarpedon or Rhadamanthys.",
      "You knew those were the choices all along.\"",
      "He grew furious.",
      "\"For the kingdom!",
      "Not for you.\"",
      "'It... it doesn't matter.",
      "It's good for the kingdom that the chosen king be in the family of the kings.\"",
      "He couldn't believe his ears.",
      "She went on relentlessly.",
      "\"Whoever is chosen by the assembly of the lords, to him... to him I'll offer myself in marriage.\"",
      "He turned his face away.",
      "She whispered.",
      "\"Please don't hate me.",
      "Eteocretans and Lycians, Pelasgians and Achaeans and Cydonians.",
      "There has to be peace.",
      "Balance.",
      "My father knew that.\"",
      "\"Your father!!",
      "Your father supported me.",
      "He wanted us to get married.\"",
      "She closed her eyes.",
      "\"And I wish we had done so, earlier.",
      "If so you would have become king by now.",
      "But it's too late now.\"",
      "\"So, you'll ignore both your heart and your father's wishes.\"",
      "It seemed like a bad joke.",
      "She stared back at him.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "For the good of the kingdom.",
      "Neither his nor my own wishes matter.\"",
      "He looked at her in silence.",
      "Oh, my poor princess, he thought, I knew that you were hard.",
      "But I never guessed how much.",
      "\"Make love to me,\" she repeated.",
      "Her voice was steadier this time.",
      "He looked into her eyes.",
      "I could do it.",
      "I could let myself use and be used.",
      "He kissed her deeply and she closed her eyes savouring the taste of his lips.",
      "When she opened them again he had already left.",
      "Silently she wept.",
      "\"Where are you going?\" Xenia had shouted at him as he rode the chariot away.",
      "\"Away!\"",
      "he had simply shouted over his shoulder, and indeed that was his only thought at the moment.",
      "He didn't know where he was going and that had been rare for him.",
      "Or, depending on how you looked at it, way too common.",
      "And now, he had found himself before yet another palace.",
      "He stepped lightly off the chariot.",
      "After wavering for a moment, he walked in.",
      "He knew of course what this place was, as did all of Knossos and possibly all of Crete.",
      "It was the first palace, a palace far older and at one time far grander and more beautiful than the one he had just fled from.",
      "And, like the civilisation that had built it, it had seen far better days.",
      "Crete had once been mighty, in some ways surpassing even the splendour of Kemet.",
      "Not in armies of course: surrounded by the wide sea it had rarely needed to defend itself against invaders, and even more rarely had desired to invade others.",
      "Wealth would be a rather closer comparison -- a wealth gained through commerce for in those times Crete had ruled all the seas all the way north to Troy and east to Phoenicia and south to the delta of the Nile.",
      "But what had been the glory of Crete was its joy.",
      "(He lightly passed his hand over the wall where had been drawn an image that made him smile -- two young children, a boy and a girl, boxing, each with one hand gloved, one bare.",
      "Such sports were the mark of the Cretans.)",
      "It had been a land of artists and athletes and builders.",
      "And in the midst of a whole realm of light, the palace had been the brightest place in it all, the kingdom's centre and symbol.",
      "The Deluge, now centuries past, had killed thousands.",
      "It had demolished the land with earthquakes, it had drowned her with tidal waves, it had caused her to starve when it covered her with volcanic ash.",
      "He snorted.",
      "That catastrophe had been nothing compared to what he considered the worst disaster of them all.",
      "The Argives.",
      "Great Mother, how he hated the Argives!",
      "Compared to the Cretans, Tectamus and his fellow invaders had been nothing but a horde of uneducated savages, a warrior civilisation with no knowledge of beauty except where they had learned from the Cretans themselves.",
      "But nonetheless they came and they killed and they burned.",
      "And the palace, this mighty palace of the labyrinthine passages and the wall-to-wall paintings and the architecture that astounded even Daedalus, they turned into a symbol of slavery.",
      "That had been the beginning of the end though it would not be for many decades more that the island would be rocked by Asterius' rebellion and the palace would be burned down, an event that the Cretans would celebrate for a long time.",
      "They had a right to do so.",
      "It was the fall of the symbol of tyranny.",
      "And alongside it the fall of the symbol of Old Crete.",
      "He knew he was getting dismal all over again, but for the moment he didn't care.",
      "Asterius proved a far more worthy and gentle king than his father, of course.",
      "He treated Achaeans and natives equally and indeed he was considered by many to be more Cretan than Argive.",
      "He united the island once again and managed to hold his own against further invasions.",
      "As for his own namesake, Asterius' son, Minos, he was a figure to be respected once more throughout the seas.",
      "A figure to be respected... as the Argive ruler of a land filled with Argives of course.",
      "It was a lost cause.",
      "It didn't matter that Crete was strong once more, for its inhabitants were no longer the same.",
      "Even Rhadamanthys and Kalliphon, so proudly bearing the name Eteocretan, \"true\" Cretan, never even considered the possibility that Pasiphae could rule by herself, Priestess and Queen, and that her husband should be nothing more than an advisor, normally would be nothing more than a consort.",
      "He leaned heavily against a pillar.",
      "He would leave; he had to leave.",
      "Pasiphae didn't want him, this island didn't want him, this was now an Achaean place filled with as much strife as Mycenae or Tiryns, marriage served politics and poisons ruled, and kings were murdered so that others replaced them, and he...",
      "He suddenly opened his eyes wide and stood straight.",
      "What a fool he had been.",
      "What a fool she had been.",
      "A sweet fool.",
      "\"Oh, my princess...\" His eyes took in the room he had just wandered into.",
      "The throne room.",
      "How fitting.",
      "He walked across the room and touched the stone chair.",
      "And then he sat.",
      "His eyes glinted and his mouth twisted into a hawkish smile.",
      "Pasiphae had been afraid that were he to marry her and thus claim the throne, he would be quickly murdered.",
      "Perhaps she was afraid that he would be quickly murdered even if she remained unwed and he stayed on the island at all, a dangerous candidate to be removed.",
      "He would show her, show the island that he feared neither Rhadamanthys nor Sarpedon.",
      "And if that was what it took to have her as wife, he would become a king on his own.",
      "And he would make Crete great again.",
      "His smile failed for a moment.",
      "There would be a price, a personal price, to pay.",
      "And it wouldn't be small.",
      "But he had rarely been a creature of long plans.",
      "That was later, and he would deal with it at the time.",
      "\"Will I ever see him again?\" she asked when Xenia walked into the room.",
      "She was not crying anymore.",
      "\"Do you even doubt it?",
      "Even I know him better than that.",
      "Do you think he'll just give up?\"",
      "\"He didn't even want to make love to me,\" she mumbled, more to herself than to Xenia.",
      "Xenia smiled with pity.",
      "Xenia had seen Pasiphae grow from childhood into maturity.",
      "After the queen's death it was she who had spoken to a young girl concerning the ways of women -- to a young woman concerning the ways of men.",
      "And in turn Pasiphae had confided everything to her, her dreams, her desires -- even when her mother was alive that happened and nowadays she didn't even realise she was doing it.",
      "For that trust, even if for nothing else, Xenia loved her.",
      "And now her princess -- her child really -- was being loveably dense.",
      "\"You wanted him for tonight and for never again.",
      "You wanted a memory.",
      "He wants the whole of you.\"",
      "Pasiphae's eyes narrowed.",
      "\"He can't have me!\"",
      "Xenia sighed.",
      "He walked over and touched Pasiphae in the shoulder.",
      "The girl shuddered at the touch and her eyes glittered with unshed tears.",
      "\"How long will I mourn for my father?\" she said -- her voice trembled.",
      "Xenia smiled bitterly.",
      "\"For the rest of your life.",
      "But it will get better.\"",
      "\"And for Minos -- how long will I grieve for him?\"",
      "She tilted her head.",
      "\"You haven't lost him.\"",
      "\"Yes, I have.\"",
      "\"You hav--\" \"Better away than dead,\" she mumbled.",
      "Ah.",
      "Now she understood the child.",
      "It did make a kind of twisted sense, especially in times like these.",
      "You are proud, my daughter.",
      "You are strong.",
      "And you blame yourself.",
      "You will make a great Queen.",
      "And a lousy wife.",
      "Minos himself doesn't know what he's getting into.",
      "She smiled with the thought.",
      "\"He doesn't need your protection, child.\"",
      "\"He'll go away.",
      "He'll leave -- he has friends everywhere.",
      "Let him go back to Egypt, or Colchis or the Phoenicians or the Maryandynians or Athens or whatever other place he has or hasn't visited already.",
      "Just not here.\"",
      "\"Child...",
      "I know people.",
      "And Minos deserves every bit of his name.",
      "He'll stay. \"",
      "Pasiphae's temper flared briefly.",
      "\"And what do you know about me, Xenia?\"",
      "But it was a silly anger and they both knew it.",
      "Xenia smiled.",
      "\"I know you deserve it also, child.",
      "My pasiphae child.",
      "All-shining daughter.\"",
      "Pasiphae looked away.",
      "\"A stupid name - an arrogant one.\"",
      "\"A perfect fit for an arrogant princess.",
      "My Heliada.",
      "Daughter of Helius Hyperion.",
      "My bright Moon.\"",
      "\"You are getting ridiculously close to hubris.\"",
      "But she also couldn't help but smile.",
      "Outrageous flattery usually annoyed her -- Xenia and Minos were the only ones who somehow managed to pull it off.",
      "Her father also.",
      "Suddenly she threw her arms around Xenia's neck and cried openly in sobs and gasps.",
      "\"I miss my father already.\"",
      "Xenia just held her.",
      "\"I know, child...",
      "I know.\"",
      "The leader of the clan stared silently at the man.",
      "She knew she was getting old -- ninety years wasn't a youthful age, not even for a sphinx.",
      "She had raised two generations of hatchlings -- she would soon help raise a third.",
      "But her memory was still sharp, and right now it flew back to a time thirty-nine years ago.",
      "\"Your... grandfather, Hierax, was a very good friend to the clan.\"",
      "Minos nodded.",
      "\"And a very good friend to me.",
      "I... owe him a lot,\" she said again and smiled.",
      "This time he didn't react.",
      "\"And he was your grandfather.\"",
      "Again he didn't speak.",
      "The sphinx laughed suddenly and jumped to her feet.",
      "Going to the cave's mouth she looked below where a number of griffins were gathered.",
      "\"Daughter!",
      "Come up for a minute.\"",
      "Golden climbed and entered the cave.",
      "The leader smiled at her and motioned her to sit.",
      "\"Who are your mother and father, daughter?\" Golden seemed a bit surprised but answered.",
      "\"Your generation, of course, and the ones older than it -- you, our mentor, the elder who tells all those stories, your rookery sister with the three curving horns--\" \"Daughter!\"",
      "said the leader, stopping Golden's recitation.",
      "\"Not your rookery parents.",
      "Your mother and father.",
      "Who mated to lay your egg?\"",
      "The look of surprise on Golden's face was replaced by what seemed like disgust.",
      "\"I wouldn't know.\"",
      "The leader barked a laugh while Minos smiled.",
      "\"Of course you wouldn't.",
      "That's all, daughter.",
      "Sorry for troubling you.\"",
      "Golden left, confused, and Leader looked back at Minos.",
      "\"All our hatchlings are taught to consider the whole clan as their family -- their older generations as parents, the younger ones as children and little siblings.",
      "But you know all that of course.\"",
      "Minos looked at her in the eyes.",
      "\"Yet one has eyes to see.",
      "You two have the same horns that curve around the ears.",
      "The same hair.\"",
      "She nodded.",
      "\"But she has drunk the milk of many mothers -- and I have given suck to many children.\"",
      "She looked at him straight in the eyes.",
      "\"In all our talks I've never asked you if that bothers you.\"",
      "He shook his head.",
      "\"In Egypt, my lady, the Pharaohs often marry their own sisters -- a thing which would be anathema in the whole of Crete and Argos.",
      "In Phoenicia all young women partake in sexual feasts; in other lands absolute chastity is required before marriage.",
      "I've been in so many places that differences in custom don't bother me any more.\"",
      "It was a while before she finally spoke again, a bit more fiercely now and cloaking her wings around her body.",
      "\"For Hierax I would do anything.",
      "His grandson means nothing to me.\"",
      "His shoulders slumped; he closed his eyes.",
      "\"But his heir...",
      "his heir I'll help.\"",
      "Eyes still closed, he smiled.",
      "One Week Later In her dreams she was visited by all the people she had lost.",
      "She saw her father and cried in his arms.",
      "She met her mother there, who was but a kind voice and a gentle hand -- with a pang of pain Pasiphae realised once again that she could no longer remember her face.",
      "She saw Meriander, the first boy she had ever loved -- or at least been infatuated with.",
      "The last time she had seen him in the waking world he had been pierced by the horns of the bull he had challenged, the flowing red blood all too clearly imprinted in her mind.",
      "Since his death and before now, she had only dreamt him once -- in an erotic dream so vivid that it had left her flushed and short of breath in the morning.",
      "She saw Minos.",
      "Startled, Pasiphae awoke.",
      "She had heard a sound -- someone was in her room.",
      "But no servant would be so indiscrete as to enter her personal bedchamber; could an assassin-- \"Are you sleeping?\" whispered a familiar voice over her.",
      "Pasiphae let out a long, relieved breath.",
      "Turning to her side, she regarded the young sphinx with a look of amused exasperation.",
      "Then she sighed exaggeratedly and sitting up, brushed a long golden lock from her eyes.",
      "\"Not anymore.",
      "And would you bring a torch from the corridor?",
      "You know I don't have your eyes.\"",
      "Golden scurried lightly out and a moment later was back with a flaming torch which she placed on a stand.",
      "Pasiphae watched her with what she realised was tenderness -- the girl was silly, often annoying, sometimes infuriating.",
      "But she was always fun and would remain young and carefree even when they would all have gone old and grey.",
      "She was glad to realise that for that she loved the young sphinx more than she envied her.",
      "It was always good to see more than selfishness in your soul.",
      "\"What?!",
      "What are you staring at?\" Golden demanded.",
      "Youth, Pasiphae wanted to say.",
      "But she couldn't -- no chance the girl would realise how one could feel old while not yet twenty.",
      "\"Your dress.",
      "A little bit overdressed, aren't you?\" she said instead, teasingly: The girl wore a skirt and blouse that seemed specially tailored to suit her tail and wings.",
      "They were quite revealing for Achaean (though not Old Cretan) standards -- but they were certainly far more than she usually wore.",
      "\"You are telling me!",
      "But Minos insisted I have to wear clothes -- and, can you believe it, the Leader agreed!",
      "Not to mention Coeranus -- if I am to be his apprentice, I'll have to wear them almost all the time.",
      "What is it with humans, can you tell me?",
      "Why can't I go like always?\"",
      "\"The men would get distracted, the women would get envious, and from what I hear the little children would go blind.\"",
      "She chuckled and leaned back.",
      "Golden looked at her toes -- she was almost blushing.",
      "\"Nothing you could envy,\" she seemed to mumble, so low that Pasiphae almost didn't hear her.",
      "Don't be so sure, my sweet little girl.",
      "You have a whole clansful of parents.",
      "But again she couldn't say it; instead she only smiled.",
      "\"Did you come here just for a visit?\" she said at last.",
      "The sphinx-girl hesitated.",
      "\"He said it would be good for you if I were to come.\"",
      "Pasiphae's smile faded.",
      "\"Minos.\"",
      "\"He told me to carry you to him if you agree.",
      "He wants to talk to you.\"",
      "Does he, now?",
      "A pause.",
      "\"I won't go.\"",
      "Now Golden was becoming fidgety.",
      "\"He told me to remind you of Colchis if you refused.\"",
      "Pasiphae glared.",
      "And then she closed her eyes and breathed out, once.",
      "\"Very well,\" she sighed.",
      "Golden clapped her hands happily and immediately pulled her from under the blankets and out of the bed; she was already heading for the window, before Pasiphae managed to protest.",
      "\"Hey!\"",
      "\"What?",
      "Didn't you say you are coming?\"",
      "\"Yeah, but...",
      "I should get dressed first.\"",
      "Golden stared blankly for a moment uncomprehending, then looked down at the princess's naked body and rolled her eyes.",
      "\"You are such a human.\"",
      "Sarpedon always considered himself a man of deeds -- a warrior, not a scholar.",
      "But often you had to know before you acted, to speak before you moved.",
      "If only to decide which way to point your sword.",
      "And events seemed to tell him that through his absence from Knossos this last year he had missed out on a lot.",
      "\"And this?",
      "What is this for?",
      "Is it for a statue?\"",
      "He was examining a weird drawing.",
      "A naked man drawn from various different angles: but lines crossed the body in different directions without apparent meaning.",
      "Daedalus raised his head from his work and glanced at it briefly.",
      "\"It can help in one,\" he admitted -- \"but mainly it's a study of anatomy.\"",
      "Sarpedon let it slide.",
      "After all there was far too much in this workshop of the Athenian inventor that he couldn't understand.",
      "And those things that he could understand... he wasn't certain he always liked them.",
      "Nearby a bed-sheet covered an object of almost man-height.",
      "\"May I?\"",
      "Again the inventor glanced briefly from his work.",
      "\"Go ahead.",
      "But it's not yet finished.\"",
      "Sarpedon removed the sheet, almost dreading to see what kind of contraption would be hidden under there.",
      "This time it was simply the statue of a woman, carved in wood.",
      "Unfinished, yes.",
      "But the intent was obvious -- the woman was running; her half-torn dress exposed a breast.",
      "But she was not fleeing -- there was something on the face which despite its crudity (and the statue was crude in a sense which had nothing to do with its being unfinished) showed clearly that this was no damsel in distress.",
      "This was a goddess on the Hunt.",
      "\"Britomartis,\" he breathed.",
      "Daedalus nodded happily -- his eyes shone.",
      "\"It will be my best statue yet.",
      "Had a live model for that one.",
      "Minos brought her to me; I haven't ever --\" But Sarpedon was no longer listening.",
      "He was trembling.",
      "There was something here that was... alien.",
      "Or at least unknown.",
      "It had disturbed him from the moment he had stepped inside but he hadn't recognized it until now.",
      "He covered the statue again and stepped away from it.",
      "This man, this Daedalus.",
      "Where were his thoughts coming from?",
      "He had shown him such weird contraptions that ranged from that ridiculous folding chair all the way to this thing of crude... genius.",
      "Medicine, magic... even divination -- those could all be taught.",
      "But you couldn't train to think like this man -- inventing things that had not existed before; and not doing it once by accident, but repeating it time and again...",
      "He understood now it was closer to art than anything he had ever seen -- and yet unlike art it could give power to creator -- and ruler.",
      "This man... the gods could fear this man and others like him.",
      "\"Are you all right?",
      "You seem ill,\" Daedalus said.",
      "Sarpedon managed to smile.",
      "\"I'm fine.",
      "What are you working on now?\"",
      "\"Come and see.\"",
      "Sarpedon walked over.",
      "There was a wooden construction on the bench before the inventor -- no more than one palm in height or length.",
      "And Sarpedon couldn't of course understand it one bit.",
      "\"I call it a 'thrower'.",
      "It's a miniature of course, but it will suffice for demonstration when it's ready.\"",
      "\"What does it do?\" \"Throw things.\"",
      "The inventor laughed at Sarpedon's look.",
      "\"Rocks on ships or walls for example.\"",
      "\"Like Talos.\"",
      "\"Perhaps,\" Daedalus said with a forced smile.",
      "Sarpedon sensed he didn't like the topic -- perhaps the inventor disliked things like Talos that he couldn't comprehend.",
      "We have that much in common, at least.",
      "He went and looked out of the window, trying to think even though he felt like an idiot by simply being in this room.",
      "From here he could just see a large shape leap from a window in the palace and glide away, passing briefly in front of the full moon.",
      "Back to the business at hand.",
      "\"Tell me, friend,\" he said making his voice amiable.",
      "\"What do you know about the griffins?\" Golden let her down on the rooftop of the old palace.",
      "He walked from out of the shadows.",
      "\"Don't go too far.",
      "You'll be needed to take the lady back.\"",
      "Golden and her grey-skinned brother nodded and glided away.",
      "Minos and Pasiphae looked at each other in silence for a while.",
      "She saw how he wore the white clothes that queen Idyia had given him in Colchis -- the ones which seemed to glitter under the light of the moon and stars.",
      "The ones he had been wearing the night when they had first made love.",
      "Feeling manipulative tonight, Minos?",
      "Or simply regretful?",
      "He broke the silence.",
      "\"My queen.\"",
      "\"Only a princess, lord Minos.\"",
      "He ignored the correction.",
      "\"Tomorrow the games in honour of your father will begin, my lady.",
      "I will be there to compete also.\"",
      "\"Certainly.\"",
      "\"And I'll also be there to present myself among the contestants for the throne.\"",
      "She glared at him for a moment.",
      "\"They won't even notice you,\" she said at last, slowly.",
      "\"Oh, I think they'll do more than that.",
      "I think they'll also crown me.",
      "But I didn't bring you here to tell you that.\"",
      "She took a deep breath.",
      "\"What, then?\" Minos sighed and turned his back.",
      "He lowered his head for a moment.",
      "\"I don't know where to begin.",
      "I think that's why I came here.",
      "To find a beginning.\"",
      "She looked at him questioningly.",
      "He turned his head and looked at her, suddenly smiling.",
      "\"I mean this palace.",
      "A beginning.",
      "But I was foolish of course, this is but a place.",
      "I should have looked closer.\"",
      "She shook her head.",
      "\"I don't understand you.\"",
      "Minos' smile remained on his face, but his shoulders sagged somewhat.",
      "He sat down and stared across the plain.",
      "\"Never mind.",
      "But I wanted to explain to you why I am doing this.",
      "I myself didn't understand it for a few days.",
      "I thought it was just stubbornness, or my desire for you.",
      "But that would be foolish.",
      "It's far more than that...\" His eyes took a faraway look.",
      "\"I can feel it everywhere.",
      "There's a sense of decay in the air, in the ground.",
      "A sense that what is to come in the next century, perhaps in the next few decades, is all that there will ever be.",
      "In a sense, anyway.\"",
      "She hesitated.",
      "Then she sat down by his side.",
      "\"I really don't understand what you mean,\" she said, more softly now.",
      "He shook his head.",
      "\"The Hittites are warring with the Egyptians.",
      "It will be a long war and will lead both nations and other neighbouring ones into decay and death.",
      "In the Achaean country the descendants of Perseus are going into war over Mycenae.\"",
      "He paused again for a moment, then sneered.",
      "\"And, as if that wasn't enough, there's a time of heroes ahead.\"",
      "He had put such contempt into the word that Pasiphae shivered and moved away slightly.",
      "\"I don't...\" \"Heroes need enemies, my lady, heroes need monsters.",
      "And when enemies aren't coming to them, my lady, to what country will they bring their war?",
      "And when dangers are lacking, whom will they label as monsters and whom will they kill?\"",
      "He leaned towards her and she shivered again.",
      "\"Do you see them, my lady?\" he whispered in her ear.",
      "\"Golden and her young lover dancing in the currents of the wind?",
      "Will it be they, or will it be their future children that will be smashed in their sleep?\"",
      "She reacted to the certainty in his voice.",
      "\"It won't happen!",
      "I won't allow it!\"",
      "she shouted at him.",
      "He smiled bitterly.",
      "\"And who are you, my lady, to so ensure it?\"",
      "\"I am the queen!\"",
      "He stood up and looked at her in sadness.",
      "\"No, you are not.",
      "You are just a princess, my lady, though in better times you'd have been more than that.",
      "But whether queen or princess, you'll have no power over your husband or your realm.",
      "And if heroes cut off Golden's head, as Perseus did with Medusa's, you'll have no way to stop it from being dishonoured, no way to stop them from being worshipped.\"",
      "Her eyes glittered with tears.",
      "Whether it was for the future he was describing or for her father, she didn't know.",
      "But she hated herself for having been so affected by his words, for letting him see it, as she knew he could.",
      "He kneeled by her side again and touched her softly on the shoulder: his touch was suddenly too much to bear and she breathed in sharply in what was almost a sob -- her tears flowed freely from her eyes.",
      "Minos let her be for a while then slowly lifted her chin and stared into her eyes.",
      "He was hesitant now.",
      "\"I'm not a seer, my lady.",
      "I am not saying what will be.\"",
      "She suddenly laughed among her tears.",
      "\"I think I'm crying more for myself, than for any possible future of Golden.\"",
      "He smiled and wiped away her tears with the back of his hand.",
      "\"Don't.",
      "For either.",
      "No need.",
      "For though I'm no seer, my lady, I know that I will be king -- and Golden will live to have children and grandchildren.\"",
      "She smiled at his certainty.",
      "They looked at each other and he suddenly leaned over and kissed her deeply.",
      "\"I think you should be heading back.",
      "They may be searching for you,\" he said as they broke off the kiss.",
      "He helped her to her feet and waved at the two young sphinxes who turned in their aerial games and headed back for the building.",
      "\"Are they truly lovers?\" Pasiphae whispered at Minos.",
      "\"They are so young...\" He chuckled.",
      "\"I don't think they've even kissed actually.",
      "But they will be mated before year's end.",
      "And two years from now the obnoxious rascal will have an egg laid in the rookery!\"",
      "She threw an inquiring look towards him but he didn't notice it.",
      "Golden and her rookery brother alighted on the roof and once again Pasiphae let herself be lifted by the young sphinx-girl and as they flew off again she cast a last glance towards Minos.",
      "And she saw him shining motionless in the moonlight, silent and serious, wearing the clothes he had been wearing in that dance in Colchis when she had seen him and first understood she loved him, and he stared back; and his eyes shone like stars, and -- --and for a moment she truly believed beyond logic that he would indeed become her king and husband, that there was nothing that this man couldn't do.",
      "But the moment passed -- history doesn't work that way, no matter what the poets said.",
      "\"It doesn't work that way\" she whispered.",
      "Golden heard it.",
      "\"What doesn't work that way?\" Pasiphae turned towards her and smiled.",
      "\"Did you know that Minos has been making prophecies?\"",
      "\"He has?",
      "Hah.",
      "No fair.",
      "I am supposed to be the witch around here.",
      "What did he predict?\" Pasiphae felt light-headed.",
      "Her mood had already become better.",
      "\"Oh, nothing much.",
      "That he'll become king, that I will marry him, that by next year you and your rookery brother will be lovers,\" she said and instantly regretted it as Golden almost lost her hold on her and veered in her path before regaining her balance.",
      "The griffin-boy flew anxiously closer.",
      "\"What's wrong?\" Golden looked at him, turned instantly orange, tried to stammer a response and finally gave up and simply looked straight ahead.",
      "Pasiphae had turned pale, and now she tried to hold on more tightly.",
      "Nevertheless she somehow managed to laugh.",
      "\"Perhaps she'll tell you.",
      "But most probably she won't.",
      "Now, shoo!",
      "Girl-talk here.\"",
      "As the boy glided further away, Golden breathed in and out deeply.",
      "Then she glared at the smiling princess.",
      "\"If he had heard you, I'd really have dropped you,\" she hissed.",
      "\"A-ha.\"",
      "Pasiphae thought that she indeed might have, if only by accident.",
      "It might be the first time one truly died of embarrassment; though it would not be the embarrassed party that would fall to their death.",
      "\"As for Minos's prophecies, two out of three isn't that bad.\"",
      "Pasiphae lifted an eyebrow.",
      "\"Your meaning?\" Golden grinned.",
      "\"That it's my turn to prophesise: Less than a month from now I will be dancing in your wedding, princess.",
      "If I'm allowed to, that is.\"",
      "\"Only as long as I'm allowed to dance at your mating ceremony, little sister!\"",
      "\"Shut up!\"",
      "Great Mother, how he hated the Argives!",
      "This had once been a bright city in a majestic land.",
      "The centre of the Cretan civilisation, from where they had ruled all the known seas and occasionally reached the unknown ones beyond the straits of Hesperia near where Oceanus touched all mortal streams.",
      "A great city of a great land of a great people.",
      "And then the Argives had come, killing and burning and pillaging, a horde of crass barbarians with less respect for greatness or holiness than animals.",
      "And they imposed their foreign language and they erected their ugly buildings.",
      "He looked from the balcony of the palace at the city beyond.",
      "Yet even the Argives hadn't managed to destroy its beauty.",
      "Not entirely.",
      "Not irreversibly.",
      "Four kings.",
      "Tectamus.",
      "Asterius.",
      "Minos.",
      "Lycastus.",
      "It had lasted four kings and more than a hundred years -- but the Achaean dynasty of kings had finally ended.",
      "The next king would be Cretan.",

      "Kalliphon smiled.",
      "\"You, actually.",
      "You will make a great king, Rhadamanthys.\"",
      "\"So I hope, with the gods' help -- and yours!\"",
      "Rhadamanthys said.",
      "Kalliphon shook his head but he still smiled.",
      "\"The gods do as they do beyond my power to know or control -- but I'm honored that you think I helped you, lord.\"",
      "Rhadamanthys didn't comment on that one.",
      "Despite Kalliphon's words they both knew how much he owed to the man.",
      "He walked to him and also looked outside.",
      "\"It's a beautiful city, Rhadamanthys.",
      "Treat her well.\"",
      "\"I've not yet become king, old friend.\"",
      "Kalliphon shrugged.",
      "\"Who else?",
      "The Lycians are too few in number.",
      "And Sarpedon is no king -- only an insolent brat whose mother decided a descent from Zeus would be good for her son.\"",
      "Rhadamanthys smiled thinly at this.",
      "\"There's no one else.",
      "It's you.",
      "Our people.\"",
      "He was tired; he was old.",
      "But for the first time in a long while, Kalliphon felt... content.",
      "\"Let's go and get some sleep.",
      "It will be a busy day tomorrow.\"",
      "The Leader pulled herself up onto the roof.",
      "\"Decided where you are going to roost?\" Minos asked her.",
      "\"Here on the roof. \"",
      "Minos turned towards her.",
      "\"In public view?",
      "You are certain?\"",
      "\"We may be denied the sight of the Sun, but we prefer not to deny him the same courtesy.",
      "Will you protect us?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" he breathed.",
      "\"That settles it then.\"",
      "There was a long silence.",
      "\"Lady, are you certain about this?\"",
      "He was not speaking about their roosting place anymore.",
      "She smiled, wickedly.",
      "\"People think that we have no names of our own.",
      "But it's the opposite -- we have many and try to honour them all.",
      "I am Leader; shall I not lead my clan with pride?",
      "For Hierax I was once friend.",
      "Should I not honour that one either?\" Minos looked away.",
      "\"I won't hold you bound to any promise, given to me or any other.\"",
      "\"I remember this place well.",
      "I had last been here almost forty years ago.",
      "It's here that I mated for the last time -- when I conceived the only egg I ever laid.\"",
      "Still he didn't look at her.",
      "\"Your mate... I... have heard how brave he was.\"",
      "\"I remember how he called me my love.",
      "Of all my names that was my favourite until the time when my children first called me mother.\"",
      "At last he turned towards her, smiling.",
      "\"Beautiful one, mother of beautiful children.\"",
      "She also smiled, but it held sadness.",
      "\"Perhaps so, though beauty is lost, and youth goes away, and children grow up.\"",
      "\"And Azrael knows all our names,\" he whispered -- to himself, but she heard it.",
      "\"Yours and mine also.\"",
      "Next Night They came.",
      "All of them did from the ninety cities of Crete.",
      "There came fat Aedonius, lord of Cydonia.",
      "There came Dorianthus of Gortys and Epiander of Rhytium.",
      "From Lyctus came Bremus, and his father Hyperanthus.",
      "There came the Eteocretans.",
      "Many they were and fully dressed in armour, as was their custom to honour the dead king.",
      "In front of them went the young lord, golden-haired Rhadamanthys and on his side it was the grey-bearded advisor, general of old wars, wise Kalliphon, who held the reins of the chariot.",
      "They went with easy confidence and stern looks.",
      "There came the Lycians.",
      "Sarpedon rode in front of them, raven hair flowing in the wind, and laughter on his lips; youth was in his piercing blue eyes, and strength of war in his hands -- those who saw him that hour could easily believe his claim to be a son of Zeus and more than worthy to be counted among the grandchildren of Bellerophon, him who had dared to ride his flying steed all the way to Olympus and into an unknown destiny.",
      "There came Minos.",
      "Pasiphae had been taught the ceremony long ago -- when she was a child in the temple of the sun-god -- for she was indeed a heliad.",
      "She was a princess, she had been an athlete; but she had also been among the young women who had been initiated into the worship of Helius.",
      "Her tasks were few -- she was not fully devoted to the god, she was not a priestess in training.",
      "Up to now, it had influenced her life only briefly -- sporadically; when she was simply one of many who every year conducted the Midsummer ceremony; a few other smaller ceremonies throughout the year.",
      "And of course in Colchis last year.",
      "She closed her eyes against the memory...",
      "The thought of Colchis brought back memories of her friends there of course -queen Idyia and king Aeetes- but it mainly brought back memories of Minos too joyful, too intense to recollect without regret and grief.",
      "And she had to maintain her dignity.",
      "She had to keep her mind on the job at hand.",
      "The next stage of the... ordeal was beginning.",
      "The lords of the island would present themselves to announce their participation for the games tomorrow -- and some of them would undoubtedly announce their claim for the throne.",
      "She hoped against hope that Minos wouldn't be among them.",
      "She ignored the large majority of lords, acknowledging their words mechanically, as if she was an automaton no more alive than Talos.",
      "But now came one who she knew would lay the first claim.",
      "\"I am Rhadamanthys, son of Hephaestius, son of Calos.",
      "May the gods provide me with victory in the games -- may I be trusted with the rule of this land.\"",
      "Are you the one who killed my father?",
      "Are you the one I'll marry?",
      "As with the others, she gave him to drink from the sacred cup -- the wine and water mixed with blood from the sacrificed bull.",
      "The man stood and giving one last bow, stepped back.",
      "Rhadamanthys, you were seeking my hand in marriage.",
      "Perhaps you'll have it.",
      "But if you killed my father, the next cup I'll give you will hold poison.",
      "A few lesser lords announced themselves in turn -- all of them prayed for their victory in the games; but predictably none laid a claim on the throne.",
      "Pasiphae searched for Minos in the crowd, trying to not be obvious about it...",
      "His absence worried her: he was planning something.",
      "Xenia was right: he wouldn't abandon the-- The man that came forward now was Sarpedon with the dark hair and piercing blue eyes.",
      "She wondered briefly if the man would be so unbelievably bold as to name his father as Zeus.",
      "It seemed a lose-lose situation for him -- would he indirectly admit himself a bastard by stating no patronym?",
      "Or would he infuriate many by proclaiming himself semi-divine?",
      "\"I am Sarpedon, son of Laodamia, daughter of Philonoe.",
      "May the gods provide me with victory in the games -- may I be trusted with the rule of this land.\"",
      "She smiled -- she had momentarily forgotten this Lycian custom of naming mothers instead of fathers.",
      "No matter.",
      "They-- There was a commotion in the crowd -- someone was pointing and shouting something.",
      "Many faces were turned towards where the hand was pointing.",
      "And they all saw the many forms on the top of the temple.",
      "And then the sphinxes leaped and swooped over the crowd.",
      "The general reaction was surprise.",
      "Awe. Fear.",
      "Some fell to the ground, even though the sphinxes were flying far above their heads.",
      "Others still stood, seemingly dazed.",
      "Kalliphon was silent and unmoving, an indiscernible expression on his face -- but certainly not fear.",
      "Some took out their swords.",
      "Some guards lifted their bows and prepared to shoot.",
      "And seeing this, something suddenly clicked inside Pasiphae, a bit of half-forgotten lore mixed with a touch of fear for her friends.",
      "\"MAKE WAY FOR THE SACRED BEASTS!",
      "HONOUR TO THE MESSENGERS OF THE GODS!\"",
      "Her voice held authority.",
      "The other priestesses took the cue from her.",
      "\"MAKE WAY!",
      "HONOUR TO THE SACRED BEASTS!\"",
      "And reluctantly, fearfully, the people listened -- no arrows were fired, and when the leader of the clan (Pasiphae stood on her toes trying to see her tall form in the night) landed beyond the crowd, no one attacked her.",
      "\"MAKE WAY!\"",
      "she shouted again.",
      "And she was obeyed -- a corridor opened, through which the red sphinx passed.",
      "Pasiphae noted two things: first the sphinxes all wore clothes (varying from full armour all the way down to simple loincloths) and; second, that besides the leader walked Minos.",
      "Figures.",
      "\"My lady,\" he spoke to her, a step behind the sphinx, \"in the funeral games for Lycastus's father, forty years ago, the clan was there to pay their respects.",
      "Why was it not invited today?\"",
      "What is your game, Minos?",
      "\"An oversight,\" she told him curtly and turned to the leader.",
      "\"Since you were not awake to witness the funeral I did not think you'd desire to attend the ceremonies after.",
      "My apologies.\"",
      "The leader nodded pleasantly and extended a hand.",
      "They held wrists.",
      "Pasiphae could feel the stunned looks from some of the lords around -- but the most educated ones knew of the old pacts between Asterius or king Minos and the sphinxes.",
      "To them this was surprising in that it was unexpected, not in that it was unheard of.",
      "The leader stepped back.",
      "Minos moved forward and kneeled in front of her.",
      "\"I am Minos.",
      "May I be trusted with the rule of this land.\"",
      "He took the cup from her reluctant hands and drained it.",
      "\"Got you,\" said Sarpedon and smiled.",
      "Next Day They paused for a while before the fight to look at each other.",
      "\"Taking part in almost every sport.",
      "And almost always victorious.",
      "Why are you doing this?\" Sarpedon asked.",
      "\"One does what one must.\"",
      "\"Running.",
      "Boxing.",
      "Wrestling.",
      "In archery you defeated even Rhadamanthys.",
      "Did you know he was considered an unsurpassed archer in the whole of this island?\"",
      "\"I'm not from this island.\"",
      "\"Indeed!",
      "And though you have eyes of a hawk,\" continued Sarpedon, \"and strength of a bull, what good do you think it will do to you, a stranger in a foreign land?",
      "Who will want a foreigner as king, be he the best athlete and champion?",
      "Being a warrior is not enough.\"",
      "\"Are you describing me or you?\" Sarpedon chuckled.",
      "\"Indeed!",
      "Defend yourself!\"",
      "And he leaped ahead with spear at hand and they fought.",
      "\"Stop!",
      "Stop!\"",
      "the heralds cried.",
      "The fight had lasted only a little while but it had been so intense that the spectators had become very worried that death would be the result.",
      "\"The gods will punish us all if such a fight between obvious equals is continued.",
      "Let the prize be shared -- let no blood be spilled.\"",
      "Minos and Sarpedon stopped their fight and threw down their weapons.",
      "\"The gods?",
      "You think they'd care?\" Sarpedon whispered to Minos with a grin before moving away.",
      "\"Perhaps some would,\" Minos said softly to himself.",
      "\"It's not enough!\"",
      "said Sarpedon again.",
      "\"You know that, as well as I.\" \"Indeed.\"",
      "It's not enough.",
      "There will be a price.",
      "Minos breathed in deeply.",
      "It would be risky, but there was no -- He stopped short, briefly disgusted at his previous thought.",
      "There was a choice, there was always a choice.",
      "If there was no choice, all that remained was blind destiny or luck; and he'd never believed in either.",
      "So it was his choice.",
      "Be it so.",
      "He leaped onto the rock and cried out for attention, then waited for the gathered crowd to fall silent.",

      "There was a small murmur but no protest yet.",
      "Patience.",
      "\"We've taken part in the games -- you now know of our skills in archery, in running, in chariot-races, in fighting.",
      "Yet what is this?",
      "Will the future king be required to do anything of these?",
      "Or will you try to judge us through our past deeds?",
      "Do you think that either of us has had experience with such a realm?\"",
      "If he remained at this, he would be in essence arguing against himself -- for he was the only one of the three who (to the lords' knowledge) hadn't ruled even a city -- while both Sarpedon and Rhadamanthys had.",
      "Even a minor Cretan lord often ruled over a territory larger than many an Achaean king.",
      "But not he.",
      "\"You know that it's ignorance that guides you.",
      "And it can be no other way.\"",
      "Several voices finally arose.",
      "He let it a few seconds until they were loud enough- \"Who are you to judge us\"-\"What do you want to do then?\" \"LET THE GODS DECIDE!\"",
      "he cried out.",
      "\"LET THE GODS DECIDE!\"",
      "The voices were silenced.",

      "\"What do you want us to do then?\"",
      "It was Epiamus -- a minor Eteocretan lord with a booming voice.",
      "\"A lottery?",
      "An oracle?",
      "The gods aren't obliged to give us answers to our problems, nor do we want to invite their anger by constantly asking them to do so.\"",
      "\"BE IT SO!\"",
      "Minos shouted again.",
      "\"Let it be me alone who shall invite their anger -- or their blessing.",
      "For if some gods cared enough about our realm to give us the bronze Talos, it may be that they still care enough to give us a sign for the future king.",
      "If I have the favour of the gods, then may the same sign be given as a hundred years ago.",
      "Let a white bull come out of the sea -- let it pass through Knossos and be seen by all, so that all know who's favoured by the gods to be king under their blessing.\"",
      "He grinned at the silent faces and now spoke softly.",
      "\"If Rhadamanthys or Sarpedon desire it, let them also invite signs.",
      "But it is not necessary.",
      "By this time tomorrow you'll all have seen -- and you all shall know.\"",
      "He leaped down from the rock and walked through the skeptical crowd.",
      "\"Lord, why did you do that?\" Minos's voice was soft.",
      "\"Don't you believe in the gods, Creon?\"",
      "\"Of course I do, but...\" \"But?\" Creon's shoulders fell; but he could see the humour in his response.",
      "\"But not enough to bet anything of importance on their will.\"",
      "Minos laughed softly.",
      "\"Good for you.",
      "Now, please, you and the rest go home.",

      "Creon hesitated for a moment then walked away.",
      "Minos thought briefly about Creon's words...",
      "He was right of course.",
      "Trusting the gods was a sucker's game.",
      "He wondered if he was providing a bad example, then shrugged away the thought.",
      "He walked all the way to the cliff and felt the sea's wind on his face.",
      "He stripped himself of his clothes.",
      "As he went to remove his golden ring, he paused: it had once belonged to a king far above this kind of petty feuding.",
      "A man who he'd once held as dear as any grandfather.",
      "He left it on.",
      "And then taking one last look at the great drop before him, he leaped.",
      "\"What is he planning?",
      "Why is he doing this?\" Pasiphae's voice was almost pleading.",
      "Creon shook his head.",
      "\"I don't know, lady.\"",
      "But the sphinx leader smiled.",
      "\"He's Minos,\" she said.",

      "Why did he do it?",
      "What is he planning?",
      "That's the question everyone wondered about.",
      "The question that everyone would have forgotten by the next day.",
      "Because it had a ridiculously easy answer.",
      "Because everyone would be too awed to remember it.",
      "If they wanted to understand him, other questions should be asked.",
      "Questions where he himself wasn't sure he had the answers.",
      "For starters... why had he come here, three years ago?",
      "Why here?",
      "Crete was far from being the only place in the world where the name of Hierax or Mehy would be remembered...",
      "He could have chosen Phoenicia.",
      "Or Colchis where his sister and friend would arrange a kingly welcome for him.",
      "He could have stayed in Egypt: Ramesses anger was directed at Mehy -- he wouldn't care either way about a son.",
      "And of course he could always just go... home -- if it could still be called such.",
      "Truth is he had wanted to see the sphinxes again.",
      "He had wanted to see the men and women who had once befriended Hierax.",
      "The king Lycastus, a boy when Hierax had left, a strong king when Minos returned almost forty years later.",
      "The red sphinx-woman who had once been loved by Hierax.",
      "Her daughter.",
      "His body was now starting to ache for air, his lungs in pain.",
      "Still he pressed downwards.",
      "Why three years ago?",
      "Why not sooner or later?",
      "Why had he lingered and why had he hastened?",
      "The answer again presented itself: The death of Pharaoh Seti.",
      "Of my friend.",
      "Am I fleeing mortality?",
      "I've been in so many battles where the blood reached up to my knees.",
      "I've led a war against my own brother.",
      "In the dark streets of a ravaged city I've shouted in anger and anguish against the death of the firstborn.",
      "And though it was long ago, it was with my own will that I held the executioner's mace.",
      "But I can't avoid the truth.",
      "It was Seti's death that made me leave the land of Kemet; and he was far from being the first man whose death so affected me.",
      "When I leave here, whose death will I be fleeing?",
      "Laodamia looked at her son who was grinning.",
      "\"Your thoughts?\"",
      "\"Minos is betting everything on the will of the gods,\" said Sarpedon.",

      "The sharp feel of pain, the urge to find air, to swim to the surface -- he savoured it for a moment, before consciously choosing to swim upwards.",
      "All the sensations that a body could provide -sometimes even that of pain- were to be treasured.",
      "A body was to be treasured: Not everyone had one after all.",
      "As he strove to the surface, he wondered how each would be treating his words...",
      "With puzzlement certainly... with some disdain.",
      "Sarpedon, always full of blasphemous pride, would certainly consider him a fool.",
      "Rhadamanthys was more respectful of the gods but like almost everyone had learned to not expect their interference.",
      "Pasiphae, Creon, Leader... they'd just be puzzled.",
      "As they should be, really...",
      "Gaining the favour of a god was difficult.",
      "Practically impossible.",

      "He came charging out of the water -- now owning the form of a great white bull.",
      "Gaining the favour of a god was difficult and rare.",
      "Being one was rather easier.",
      "It was early afternoon when he reached the city of Knossos.",
      "The Bull stepped forward, a form more majestic than any earthly beast, a creature obviously sent by Poseidon or Zeus himself.",
      "And everyone saw.",
      "And everyone believed.",
      "And myths were born.",
      "In a long existence he had had many names and many forms.",
      "He was Minos.",
      "He was Mehy.",
      "He was Hierax.",
      "He was Min, the phallic deity, and falcon-headed Montu, the warrior god, and he was Horus the Elder, avenger-of-his-brother.",
      "He was Menes, first humaniform Pharaoh of Mortal Egypt.",
      "He was the divine hawk.",
      "And right now he was the Bull From The Sea, sign of the gods.",
      "He passed through the city.",
      "Walked slowly among the streets and among the awed crowds.",
      "None dared touch him.",
      "Then slowly, purposefully, he headed outside the city and towards his home.",
      "In the stables he turned himself back to human, and picked out a normal bull.",
      "He changed its colour to a spotless white and then went inside and dressed.",
      "Many forms, many roles, many names.",
      "So be it.",
      "That Night It had begun rather playfully.",
      "\"Yet another name to add on your admirers list, sister?\" her rookery brother asked as he threw a grape at her.",
      "He'd somehow obtained a huge cluster of them and the two of them were quickly devouring them as they were leaving the city...",
      "\"I have a list of admirers?\" she laughed catching the grape easily and popping it into her mouth.",
      "\"Why am I not informed of these things?",
      "You'd think they'd let me know, wouldn't you?",
      "Is it a long one?\" \"Huge.\"",
      "Was there a small edge in his voice, or had she imagined it?",
      "\"There's that servant boy in Minos's home, Andromachus.\"",
      "\"He does glance my way, I admit...' \"If he stared any more intensely, his eyes would fall out of their sockets.\"",
      "Another grape thrown, caught and eaten.",
      "\"Then there's Polyidus, the wizard's son.",
      "He lost his words when he first saw you.\"",
      "\"And fumbled a spell because of it.\"",
      "She giggled.",
      "\"Right.",
      "And now it's Daedalus!\"",
      "She shook her head.",
      "\"You are wrong.\"",
      "\"I saw him staring.",
      "You even went to confront him about it.",
      "What did he say?\"",
      "Again she laughed.",
      "\"His exact words were 'Can I study your flight?' \" \"What!?\"",
      "\"Of all the men who've admired my body--\" \"--the dozens of them--\" \"-shut up- he's the only one fascinated by my wings. \"",
      "He fell silent for a moment, then grinned mischievously.",
      "\"Kinky.\"",
      "She let out an incoherent cry and attacked him in mid-air even as he smirked.",
      "His eyes widened slightly and he tried to evade.",
      "But it was too late: she pushed him off balance with her feet and letting out a grunt of pain he lost his hold on the cluster.",
      "Swooping down she caught the grapes with a triumphant shout.",
      "Which quickly turned to a yelp of surprise when the boy landed on her back and pinned her three lower limbs together with his tail.",
      "\"Give it back,\" he growled softly in her ear as they were both falling with an uncomfortable speed...",
      "and she was suddenly acutely aware of the feel of his body.",
      "She felt as if she was blushing and paling all at once; her breath halted.",
      "\"Please...\" she managed to get out.",
      "\"Huh?\" \"Let go...\" His tail's hold on her loosened abruptly... and not trusting herself to glide, she landed and leaning against a tree she tried to control her breathing -- and thoughts.",
      "She didn't look at him when he also landed by her side.",
      "There was a silence for a long while...",
      "\"Want us to go get washed?\" came his soft voice -- it startled her and she looked at him blankly for a moment.",
      "He waved a hand vaguely and awkwardly -- the poor boy was so embarrassed through no fault of his own that she couldn't help but smile -- but she also understood what he was indicating...",
      "they were both covered in grape juice.",
      "\"Yeah... or Creon will have us eaten, rather than welcomed.\"",
      "She winced at the lameness of her own joke; nevertheless it remained a good idea to bathe.",
      "For starters, she could use the cold water.",
      "They climbed: there was a small stream that came down from the nearby mountain to join the Caeratus river; it was too shallow to bathe in, but five body-lengths up the mountain it fell over a small precipice to create an even smaller waterfall.",
      "She went under the stream first and moved to clean the grape juice off her body, while her rookery-brother sat nearby on a small ledge, his chin in his hands.",
      "The water was icy cold as she had thought it would be.",
      "But she smirked at her own thoughts of a few minutes ago: hadn't she been silly?",
      "True, the touch of her rookery brother's... anatomy had made her uncomfortable.",
      "And true she couldn't help but notice how it had... grown in the last few years.",
      "(She could feel herself blushing again and turned her face away)",
      "But (she hastened to add), so had they all grown.",
      "All her brothers and sisters, and she as well.",
      "And if their growing anatomy made some games uncomfortable, then they'd have to play other games.",
      "And those... feelings she'd felt had nothing to do with her rookery brother in particular, only the awkwardness of the position.",
      "There.",
      "Logical as that.",
      "Nothing to worry about.",
      "Then why could she almost see Minos's smirk, making fun of her and her attitude?",
      "Because of his \"prophecy\".",
      "Ignore it.",
      "And make conversation.",
      "Even as she spoke she knew she'd chosen the wrong topic: \"Really brother, what is it with all the humans -- I mean they are fine and all...",
      "but you'd think it would be sphinxes that should be admiring me, wouldn't you?\"",
      "There was a long pause.",
      "Her tail started twitching in nervousness.",
      "\"One already does.\"",
      "Her tail stopped twitching.",
      "\"I...I think I love you,\" he said suddenly, his voice quick, all hope, all fear...",
      "She had frozen.",
      "She remained silent, practically unmoving, her back turned to him for a long time...",
      "She didn't dare turn to look at him; she suddenly didn't want to meet his gaze which was surely piercing her all the way through...",
      "\"I'm sorry!\"",
      "he shouted suddenly and his voice made her turn in time to see him glide away in a half-panic.",
      "She almost cried out to stop him, but she didn't: she didn't know what to say.",
      "She was still standing awkwardly under the water and wondered if she looked like the idiot she felt.",
      "Why didn't I tell him something?",
      "She sat down and hugged her knees.",
      "What do I tell him?",
      "He's my friend, not my mate!",
      "Not in his mind, said a different thought.",
      "And not in yours either.",
      "Not anymore.",
      "I never treated him as anything more than a brother.",
      "Except for brief moments, hidden stares, contemplations so secret you didn't admit to yourself...",
      "Except for that time but a few minutes ago.",
      "Oh, hell!",
      "She felt like crying, but didn't know if it was out of sadness, out of joy, or out of sheer frustration.",
      "What do I tell him?",
      "That you love him, too.",
      "Do I? I... want him.",
      "That has to be different...",
      "And for the first time, she recognized that part of her mind as the most insightful one.",
      "What do I tell him?",
      "It was then that she saw the soldiers pass by, through the valley below.",
      "Heading straight for Minos's house.",
      "They moved quickly but silently in dark clothed formations.",
      "Their clothes were dark, and the darkness was their ally; for the clouds covered the light of the moon and stars.",
      "And though they were all brave men of Crete, who would not hesitate to charge in the full heat of battle, they recognized the usefulness of stealth.",
      "They were not far now.",
      "They could see the megaron from here.",
      "It would be easily taken -- the handful of servants that were there would be taken by surprise.",
      "It was then that they saw the sphinx, gliding over them and beyond them, hastening to the house, giving out a shrill cry of warning.",
      "Their leader frowned -- his face became terrible for a moment.",
      "Then he raised his sword.",
      "\"Attack!\"",
      "he shouted.",
      "And the soldiers charged.",
      "He fought.",
      "It was the first real battle of his life: up to now he had trained with the rest of his brothers and sisters as their Leader and their Teacher demanded, but real battle... he'd never experienced that.",
      "He ducked under a spear that was thrust towards his direction; then he leaned forward swiftly and grasping the hand that held it he pulled.",
      "As a result the soldier was sent flying head over heels into the nearby wall; he fell to the floor unconscious.",
      "Catching his breath he checked the situation around him.",
      "No one moved in this room; two soldiers unconscious and an old servant of the house who was still awake but incapable of fighting further -- he sat against a wall and held in pain his bleeding side.",
      "The soldiers had managed to break into the house quickly.",
      "Though at least three of them lay dead outside, killed by the arrows that the human boy Andromachus had hastily shot at them, they hadn't managed to close the doors before the enemies approached.",
      "And that could mean defeat.",
      "Even as he thought, he rushed on all fours through the corridors of the house.",
      "Someone suddenly leaped before him with naked sword: but the soldier's eyes widened when he saw a running sphinx rather than a running human.",
      "The boy used the man's surprise and hesitation to his full advantage: Even as he run past the soldier he extended his tail and used it to catch a leg and send him off balance and onto the floor.",
      "He then grabbed the man's head and hit it on the floor, sending him to dreamland.",
      "Then he resumed his run.",
      "The banquet room was a mess with tables overthrown, pots broken, and a number of men lying unmoving on the ground -- he guessed that most of the fallen enemies were the result of his sister's actions: the human residents of this house were mostly untrained and unprepared for combat.",
      "Then his eyes widened.",
      "Among the fallen there was... Andromachus.",
      "A mere boy, no more than seventeen years; and quite certainly dead.",
      "His clothes were red with blood -- a sword-wound had been his death -- his bow and arrows lay idle at his side...",
      "He gulped and steadied himself against the table.",
      "He should have been here.",
      "Here where -- He suddenly remembered that his sister had last been by Andromachus' side and he paled.",
      "\"Sister!\"",
      "he bellowed.",
      "\"Here!\"",
      "the voice came weak and exhausted from the rooms upstairs.",
      "He strode upstairs and into the first doorway there: he should have never let himself be separated from her.",
      "Three soldiers were there: they were driving his sister towards the end of the room: she had grabbed a small table and vainly tried to defend herself against the attacks of all three -- she was already bleeding from wounds in her arms.",
      "He felt his eyes glow as he rushed unthinkingly towards them.",
      "With all the force he could muster he pushed one of them into the wall -- but the other two had already turned, swords drawn.",
      "And the man whom he still held seemed only mildly dazed: he had the strength to painfully hit him on the back with his cuffed fists.",
      "Thinking rapidly, he did the only thing that crossed his mind.",
      "Grunting he managed to suddenly turn around so that it was the man who would first face the threat of the sword blades rather than his own back...",
      "He didn't know if it was actually right in any way to use a human as shield, but he'd hoped the others would hesitate to attack when they'd endanger their own-- --when the man sucked in his breath and his eyes suddenly took a look of amazement.",
      "As if by common agreement they both looked down to see the edge of a sword sticking out of the man's chest -- who had been pierced all the way through -- unknowingly accepting the strike that had been intended for the sphinx.",
      "The man died.",
      "The boy let him fall slowly to the ground and then looked up in horror to face the equally horrified soldier who'd just killed one of his own.",
      "They both stood unmoving for a moment, gasping.",
      "The other human still standing didn't waste time, though.",
      "With a cry the large warrior raised his sword -- and was promptly knocked to his knees, hit by the table that his rookery sister still held, and after that driven unconscious by her fist.",
      "The last soldier still stood uncertainly, bloodied sword in hand.",
      "Then he turned around and ran.",
      "And the boy sank to his knees and cried.",
      "And even in this sorrow, even as she knelt by her brother's side, to soothe and comfort him as much as she could, even then a part of her mind still managed to think: \"Now I love him.\"",
      "Supporting each other they stood up.",
      "And went back to the battle.",
      "The hawk alighted on a hill far from the megaron so that no one would see it, and changed back into human form.",
      "After putting on the clothes that he had left there, he started walking the rest of the distance on foot.",
      "His appearance as Bull (let alone the well-noticed direction it had taken) had caused quite a stir in the city which he hadn't wanted to miss, so he had listened in to it using his other favourite form.",
      "On the whole there was no question about it -- in the morning the throne would be his.",
      "Minos wondered if it could even be called trickery.",
      "\"Let the gods decide...\" -- one of them indeed had.",
      "And if other gods objected... he'd cross that bridge when he came to it.",
      "Distracted with such thoughts he headed back for the megaron and was unprepared when the hiding (and far more alert) warrior jumped on him and threw him to the ground.",
      "It was Sarpedon.",
      "The man fought.",
      "And killed.",
      "Damn!",
      "He had wanted this to be near bloodless.",
      "But those sphinxes ruined everything.",
      "He gathered news from his soldiers: he had lost about ten of his thirty, and on the defenders' side five or six had been killed, those who had fought too furiously to be captured safely.",
      "But the battle was nearly over.",
      "He checked out the half dozen servants in front of him and ordered three of his soldiers to escort them down to the cellars.",
      "Then he sent another three to guard the main entrance, and gathering the remaining six around him he headed for the banquet room.",
      "Hardly had they entered when the sphinxes fell on top of them, knocking him to the side in the ensuing confusion.",
      "He cursed himself again -- he had never before fought against airborne opponents.",
      "Two of his men were already down before he had even known what had happened, first stunned by the sudden weight of the sphinxes on their shoulders and then punched into unconsciousness.",
      "The remaining four of his men had already divided the two sphinxes among them as he stood up.",
      "He focused his eyes on the seemingly weaker pair -- they fought the snouted grey male who held them away with a shield he had picked up.",
      "Helyon's spear was grabbed by the beast's tail and broken as the soldier was thrusting it forward -- as the man tried to take out his sword, the sphinx's tail moved again and tripped him up.",
      "\"Helyon, Termon, aside!",
      "Let me!\"",
      "They leaped aside and away.",
      "They were good men, but hadn't learned patience or caution.",
      "And neither had the sphinx.",
      "The male sphinx just leaped at him, its eyes glowing fiercely, claws extended.",
      "And Kalliphon raised quickly his spear and let the grey creature impale itself upon it, the spear tearing through its stomach and all the way to the other side.",
      "Behind him, the golden-skinned female screamed.",
      "She heard herself scream, wordlessly.",
      "And then she rushed forward, barely stopping to scratch at a soldier's face before leaping on Kalliphon.",
      "She landed on his fist.",
      "As with her brother, it was Golden's own inertia that did the most damage -- Kalliphon felt as if he was punching a wall, but Golden was no less hurt.",
      "And then his foot kicked her hard on the stomach and, as the breath went out of her, the two men behind her grabbed one of her arms each and one of them had stepped on her tail.",
      "And she couldn't move and another one punched her again and again, and as she lost consciousness her last thought was her grey skinned brother, friend, love dying on the floor.",
      "\"She's out,\" said Taphius lifting the female's chin ungently.",
      "Kalliphon leaned heavily on the wall and gasped catching his breath.",
      "Damn that Egyptian wizard.",
      "Damn his sphinxes.",
      "\"She gave us a great deal of pain.\"",
      "That was Helyon.",
      "\"Well, now she's going to give us a great deal of pleasure,\" growled Taphius.",
      "\"Hold her for me.\"",
      "He placed a hand on the unconscious female's left breast, while the other grabbed coarsely her crotch.",
      "And then his eyes widened, and he toppled to the side, with an expression that was more confused than pained: Kalliphon had just slit the would-be rapist's throat.",
      "He still held the bloodied knife in front of him, sternly, and the other soldiers stared at it as if hypnotized.",
      "\"We... are... Eteocretans,\" Kalliphon intoned, emphasis on every word.",
      "\"We are not monsters.\"",
      "\"Get off me!\"",
      "\"Stay down!",
      "Stay down, you fool.",
      "They placed guards -- they'll shoot you full of holes before you even see them.\"",
      "Minos pushed him away.",
      "\"What are you saying?\" Sarpedon gestured towards the megaron.",
      "\"The Eteocretans.\"",
      "Minos's eyes widened.",
      "There will be a price to pay.",
      "A personal price, dammit!",
      "He clenched his fists, and quickly stood up and started for the megaron ahead.",
      "\"I've sent for help!",
      "They'll be here soon,\" whisper-shouted Sarpedon at him.",
      "Minos didn't pause.",
      "\"Then wait for them,\" he growled.",
      "\"You can't defeat them all.",
      "Not alone!",
      "Not in human form!\"",
      "Minos stopped.",
      "His lips briefly formed a grim smile.",
      "He half-turned and regarded Sarpedon seriously for a moment.",
      "\"Then follow me!\"",
      "He leaped from the hill and his body glowed briefly -- weapons flashed into existence in his hands.",
      "Sarpedon's eyes widened and then he too charged down.",
      "And none could hinder them two, the teacher and the son of Zeus.",
      "He was Minos.",
      "He was Hierax.",
      "He was Min, the phallic deity, and he was Horus the Elder, avenger-of-his-brother.",
      "He was Menes, first humaniform Pharaoh of Mortal Kemet.",
      "He was the scion of the Divine Bull, he was the half-human god.",
      "He was Montu, warrior god of Egypt.",
      "And he had fought in hundreds of battles.",
      "He hadn't even been born for the First War, when Apep Ahriman was thrown down and El Aranu (or Helius Uranus, or Lord Ra, or a number of other names in many lands) took his place as Great Mother Mab's consort and king of all gods.",
      "But when Aset was lost -- when Cronos overthrew Aranu, Min was there.",
      "And though he had been no more than a child, he had clenched his fist and sworn an oath of vengeance.",
      "And he killed.",
      "It was like a dance, and he let the rush of the battle take hold of him -- to feel drunk with the blood, with the exertion, with the death.",
      "Like Odin's berserkers, like Sekhmet in her blood-frenzy, like Kali.",
      "Except that he still held on to a part of sanity, lest he kill all, friends and foes alike.",
      "And he had danced so as to hide the birth of Zeus.",
      "And he had helped teach him.",
      "And in the war that came, he had fought at his side.",
      "And he killed.",
      "He moved like the wind, and his sword was like lightning.",
      "And he laughed.",
      "As he would fight at the side of another young pupil and kinsman many centuries later when brother would slay brother and he'd once again be turned into teacher and into warrior, into king and into avenger.",
      "And he ki... \"MINOS!",
      "Not him.\"",
      "And he blinked.",
      "And it was over.",
      "\"Kalliphon,\" he growled as he lowered his sword.",
      "The man had been disarmed and thrown to the ground ready for the kill, before the interruption.",
      "\"Rhadamanthys!\"",
      "He clenched his fist.",
      "Sarpedon was standing at the doorway, somewhat out of breath.",
      "\"Actually, no, I don't think so.",
      "My guess is it was solely him.\"",
      "He indicated Kalliphon.",
      "\"Rhadamanthys probably has no idea, or he wouldn't dare allow him--\" \"Help me!",
      "Someone HELP!\"",
      "It was Golden, more desperate than Minos had ever heard her.",
      "Kalliphon forgotten, he rushed out and towards her voice.",
      "Creon was already standing over them when he reached the room.",
      "She was cradling the boy in her arms.",
      "A boy who was obviously bleeding to death.",
      "His eyes were becoming unfocused even as Golden urged him to look at her -- his entire body was shuddering.",
      "\"Lord... there's no way he's going to survive till dawn,\" Creon told him as he approached.",
      "All his former energy had drained away.",
      "Minos suddenly felt tired.",
      "And old, very old.",
      "He let his sword drop.",
      "\"Andromachus is dead.",
      "Pandeia and Chaleion too.",
      "And more.",
      "I won't know for sure how many until we make a count.\"",
      "Creon's voice was flat, a mask for grief.",
      "\"DO SOMETHING!\"",
      "Golden wailed at them.",
      "Sarpedon appeared in the doorway.",
      "\"Only the gods can save him now.\"",
      "His voice was bitter, sarcastic.",
      "Minos slowly turned his head towards him.",
      "\"And gods forbid that gods shall care to enter into lowly mortal affairs!\"",
      "Once they did.",
      "It wasn't much better.",
      "\"Who do you think you are?\" said Creon, aghast.",
      "But Minos wasn't listening anymore.",
      "He kneeled to the side of the griffin-children.",
      "\"DO SOMETHING!\"",
      "she yelled at him.",
      "Her body was covered with bruises -- her eyes were filled with tears.",
      "And Minos suddenly felt love.",
      "He took her hand in his own and placed them both on the boy's open wound.",
      "\"...do something...\" \"My... girl does love this boy grey, So turn to stone before the day.\"",
      "Golden turned to look at her brother as he lay in her embrace -- and then her face's agonised expression froze.",
      "With a loud crackle they both turned into stone, and would remain so throughout that night and the following day.",
      "It was done.",
      "He knew that there would be a price.",
      "But it was his own to pay and he wouldn't suffer others to pay it for him.",
      "He walked away, while Creon still stared, dumbfounded.",
      "Sarpedon grabbed his upper arm as he swept past.",
      "They stared into each other's eyes.",
      "\"Well done.\"",
      "\"Let go.\"",
      "Sarpedon let him, but as Minos walked away, he followed.",
      "\"So, what was the justification for bending your kind's law this time?\" Minos clenched his fist.",
      "\"This is my home.",
      "And those are my clan's children.",
      "And it was my deeds that had caused this.",
      "I wasn't bending anything.\"",
      "\"I see.",
      "And for bending it earlier today?\" Minos's eyes flickered with an undiscernable expression.",
      "He stopped where a couple of servants were guarding Kalliphon and gave them further instructions.",
      "Then he walked away again.",
      "\"Why did you help me, Sarpedon?\"",
      "\"It was the honourable thing to do?",
      "A virtuous deed in an evil world?\" \"Stop.\"",
      "\"Very well.",
      "It was because of your eyes.\"",
      "Minos waited for more, and Sarpedon obliged, smirking.",
      "\"They were the same as the eyes of a child that I dreamed had once helped save my father.",
      "The least I could do was try and repay the favour.\"",
      "The hint of a smile appeared on Minos's lips.",
      "\"That was long ago.\"",
      "\"I only heard about it recently.\"",
      "They walked outside into the clean air.",
      "The smell of death and blood was strong inside.",
      "Minos sat down and leaned his head back to the wall.",
      "\"Going for the kingship was wrong, wasn't it?",
      "Bloodshed's the very first thing it caused.\"",
      "Sarpedon shrugged.",
      "\"Who would you have as better ruler?\" \"Pasiphae.\"",
      "\"Hah!",
      "For the Amazons, perhaps, \" Sarpedon smiled, \"though not all their customs would appeal to her.",
      "But this is the Crete of later times and you are no fool.\"",
      "Minos closed his eyes.",
      "\"You, then.\"",
      "\"I'm a warrior.",
      "And a foreigner.",
      "And a bastard.",
      "I somehow think the greatest difference between us is that you have a lot more experience being all three.\"",
      "Minos froze.",
      "And then he threw his head back and chuckled softly.",
      "\"Ah!\"",
      "Sarpedon said again.",
      "\"They are here.\"",
      "\"Your soldiers?\"",
      "\"Your sphinxes.",
      "And your princess. \"",
      "Minos snapped his eyes open even as the red leader let Pasiphae down.",
      "More griffins were landing around them.",
      "\"Minos!",
      "Sarpedon's men told us--\" \"It's over.\"",
      "He stood up and walked away from them.",
      "\"My children, Minos!",
      "Where are they?",
      "Don't play games with me,\" the Leader growled.",
      "\"They are inside,\" he heard Sarpedon answer.",
      "\"They are healing in stone.",
      "Minos changed them.\"",
      "Pasiphae stared uncomprehending.",
      "\"Stone by night?",
      "Minos did what?!\"",
      "He fled.",
      "Leader regarded the man for a moment, then turned to the princess.",
      "\"After him.\"",
      "Pasiphae was still confused.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "\"After him.",
      "If you want to see him again within the decade, after him, NOW!\"",
      "\"I have a horse nearby,\" offered Sarpedon.",
      "Pasiphae made up her mind.",
      "\"Take me to it.\"",
      "Another time, more than a century ago.",
      "He found her on the beach, as he had hoped.",
      "Europa liked walking by the seashore, under the light of the full moon.",
      "\"Hello, my lady.\"",
      "She didn't turn, but even so he could feel the joy of her smile.",
      "\"I was hoping to see you again.\"",
      "\"How could I leave without a last goodbye?\"",
      "\"You are Min.",
      "You often do the forbidden.\"",
      "She turned and they looked each other directly in the eyes.",
      "There were no lies between them.",
      "No deception.",
      "\"I've wished you joy, since the very first time I met you.",
      "It does my heart good to see you happy.\"",
      "She smiled at that.",
      "\"Did you ever love me, my friend and saviour?\" Min considered this for a moment.",
      "\"I did love you.",
      "But I'm a god of passion, not of love.",
      "I loved you less than you loved me.",
      "And it wasn't even a tenth of the love you have for Asterius.",
      "I could burn in your love.",
      "You wouldn't be even mildly scorched in mine.\"",
      "He smiled.",
      "And then there was very little to be said aloud.",
      "As if by unspoken agreement they moved forward and hugged for a long moment.",
      "\"I will look after you.",
      "You and your son both, as much as I can.\"",
      "Europa's hand rested on her swollen belly.",
      "\"I will name him after you.\"",
      "\"Goodbye.\"",
      "And then he stepped back and, with his eyes still on her, he changed into hawk shape and flew away, towards the full moon.",
      "Rhadamanthys stepped down from his chariot.",
      "He knew, long ago he had been taught, that each man was required to do three things on any moment of decision.",
      "To learn, to gather all info pertaining to the situation.",
      "To choose among all possible options.",
      "And finally to execute his decision once it had been taken, swiftly and without hesitation.",
      "Learn, choose, execute.",
      "He had also been taught that a ruler, since his cares are so large, does all three with help from others.",
      "He gathers all info with help from spies and messengers.",
      "He decides with help from his advisors.",
      "And lastly, he has his soldiers and servants to execute his commands.",
      "And sometimes this doesn't apply and even a king must do these things by himself.",
      "Learn.",
      "He saw the pile of the dead Eteocretan soldiers as they had been dragged uncaringly outside by the servants of the house -- among the corpses were way too many faces he recognised.",
      "He saw the blood being cleaned from the floors and walls with sponges and water.",
      "Soon sulphur would be brought to purify the house.",
      "If such a thing can ever really be done.",
      "He saw the statue of two griffin-children.",
      "The girl held in her arms a boy, which was dead or dying.",
      "Care and pain and love was carved in her features -- the statue had managed to capture a moment of ultimate pathos.",
      "Rhadamanthys shuddered as he understood it was no statue at all.",
      "His voice was soft and he didn't even look at the fettered man.",
      "\"Tell me what has happened here, Helyon.",

      "Choose.",
      "\"Kalliphon.\"",
      "The bound man raised his head at the voice.",
      "\"Hello, my lord.\"",
      "\"What did you try to do here, old friend?\" Rhadamanthys' voice was tinged with horror.",
      "\"To destroy the Egyptian.",
      "I failed.\"",
      "In contrast, Kalliphon's voice was calm.",
      "And regretful.",
      "\"Why didn't you come to me?\" Kalliphon didn't look at him.",
      "\"You... would have said no.",
      "And it was unfitting that you should begin your kingship so.\"",
      "Rhadamanthys clenched his fists.",
      "\"The deed would be the same whether I knew about it or not!\"",
      "he growled.",
      "\"But the doer would be different.",
      "You'd make a good king, Rhadamanthys.",
      "I'm sorry.\"",
      "Rhadamanthys staggered, and leaned heavily on the wall.",
      "He had to think.",
      "\"It wasn't worth it, Kalliphon.",
      "It wouldn't be worth it, even if you had succeeded without a single loss.\"",
      "Kalliphon's eyes flared briefly.",
      "\"It was worth it.",
      "This is the land of the Eteocretans!\"",
      "He breathed in deeply and closed his eyes before continuing.",
      "\"It was too much.",
      "More than a hundred years of Achaean rule.",
      "And now an Egyptian!",
      "Befriending the king.",
      "Courting the princess.",
      "Aiming for the throne.",
      "Lycastus was prepared to name him as his heir.\"",
      "Rhadamanthys didn't want to believe the thought that had crossed his mind \"You didn't...\" Kalliphon opened his eyes and looked up at the man.",

      "Yes.",
      "I did.\"",
      "Oh, old friend!",
      "When Rhadamanthys spoke, his voice was steady.",

      "To my judgement.\"",

      "\"I... see.",
      "By waiving the right to judge...\" He didn't like what he was going to say and he stopped.",
      "Rhadamanthys's eyes hardened.",
      "\"Yes.",
      "All comes with a price.",
      "By waiving the right to judge you, he's now into a position to judge me.",
      "By making me responsible for you, I am now responsible for you.",
      "By making me judge, he made himself king.",
      "\"And my judgement will reflect on us all.\"",
      "Kalliphon didn't speak.",
      "\"Tell me something.",
      "Anything,\" Rhadamanthys said again, still striving for control but despair threatened to creep into his voice.",

      "It was not the answer that Rhadamanthys had been hoping for.",
      "Tears in his eyes, he kissed the older man on the forehead.",

      "Again she thought she saw something, someone, the shape of a sphinx gliding in the rain just a bit further than she could recognize the one.",
      "In anger that anyone (who?",
      "a widowed elder?",

      "When she had been their age, during mating season they had all been placed in the rookery, where they played simple games all night long, with only a few widowed elders supervising them, and no knowledge of what was taking place outside.",
      "Twenty years later (and fifteen years old with the human count) she had felt all too well the boiling blood, the urge to mate.",
      "But though she had already fancied the golden boy who would later become her lover, she hadn't dared to even go near him during the season, lest she could not control her actions.",
      "She had instead found a secluded spot and (though with shame and guilt) had tried to satisfy herself with her own tail.",
      "It hadn't worked much.",
      "She had once thought that tonight, fifty years old and at the very peak of her youth, she would pity her teenage self, but instead she was envying her with all the strength of her heart.",
      "And now she half-landed half-crashed on the roof of the building in front of her (the abandoned palace it was), and there she lay and waited and held the pain inside her, until she was trembling with the unreleased sobs and finally she gave out a terrible wail of grief and anguish.",
      "And as if her wail had summoned him from the lands beyond, he walked out of the rain.",
      "In the beginning he was just a unidentifiable figure, blurred by both the rain and her tears.",
      "And then as she strained her eyes, the golden colour of his wings could be seen, and as he approached further she gasped and almost swooned, for it was her golden-skinned love that appeared in front of her.",
      "She struggled for her voice but he silenced her with his eyes.",
      "\"Say that it never happened,\" they were saying.",
      "Any other night she would have sought for answers.",
      "Any other night she would miss most his soft voice, and his light sense of humour, and the simple touch of his hand as they looked at the stars.",
      "Tonight, though, she just wanted his body against her own, making passionate love to her with no word spoken by either until dawn came.",
      "She pulled him close, and they both gasped as their bodies collided, entwined, merged into one.",
      "And yet, even as she gave and received pleasure, there were still tears in her eyes.",
      "For a part of her mind already knew that this was not her love, whom she would never see or touch or talk to again.",
      "And that like most gifts of this kind it would vanish with the dawn, little proof that it ever happened remaining behind.",
      "But nonetheless she let herself be deluded.",
      "And although the next night she would wake up indeed alone, it turned out that the egg she'd lay six months later would be proof enough.",
      "The Bull ran, and behind him Pasiphae was pursuing, even as the moon pursues the sun.",
      "How can you chase a god?",
      "You can't.",
      "Not if he really wants to go away.",
      "But Minos was exhausted.",
      "And more importantly he was always, and ultimately, a man in conflict with himself.",
      "A man of two natures.",
      "A man of many names.",
      "They ran through forest and over stream -- through glade and over hill.",
      "The occasional shepherd or farmer who'd see them would wonder with awe at the spotless white colour of the bull, at its majestic form.",
      "They were even more amazed with the golden-haired young woman that followed the bull at full speed first on horse, and then (when the terrain proved too uneven) on her own feet, as fast as they could take her.",
      "Some god must have maddened her, they said.",
      "Poseidon, perhaps, who must have sent the bull in the first place.",
      "Or Aphrodite who oft instills unholy passions into the heart.",
      "They were perhaps getting close with that last one, but only metaphorically speaking.",
      "She didn't really know why she was chasing Minos.",
      "A part of her mind, the proud, regal, perhaps arrogant part, was telling her that it was demeaning to run after any man, be he king or not, be he even a god.",
      "But also demeaning to be left behind.",
      "The part of her which was in love, said that since even Minos didn't really seem to know why he was running in the first place, it was all right for her to run as well.",
      "Then again it had never thought very logically.",
      "And a yet third part of her mind, a part which was perhaps way too influenced by the griffins, was saying teasingly that chasing down your future mate was a fun and invigorating element of the courting process.",
      "So, with all three, angry pride, and annoyed love, and grim amusement, she pursued him.",
      "Another time.",
      "Another place.",
      "Four years ago.",
      "The pharaoh strained his eyes to look at the arrival.",
      "Then, ever so slowly, he smiled.",
      "\"Mehy...\" The man kneeled by the bed where the aged king was resting in the last days of his mortal life.",
      "\"No, my lord.",
      "Don't you remember?",
      "Mehy is no more -- I am his son.\"",
      "Pharaoh Seti stared at the ceiling.",
      "Then slowly he chuckled -- a broken sound.",
      "\"Mehy...\" he said again when he stopped laughing.",
      "\"Don't lie to a dying man.\"",
      "Minos was silent for a moment.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" he said, and then he closed his eyes and changed.",
      "His youthful face became suddenly wrinkled and older -- his hair turned grey.",
      "\"Hello, my friend,\" he said.",
      "\"Ah!\"",
      "said the Pharaoh.",
      "\"There's the man I know.\"",
      "Mehy smiled.",
      "\"When did you find out?\" Seti made a gesture -- waved it away as inconsequential.",
      "\"Gradually.",
      "It doesn't matter.\"",
      "He coughed and leaned back on the pillow.",
      "\"As man I've loved you, \" he said, \"as god I've worshipped you.",
      "And I'm glad to see you one last time.\"",
      "\"Of the two, it was the man's love that I most valued,\" said Mehy.",
      "They were both silent for a long time.",
      "\"Goodbye, my friend,\" said the Pharaoh at last.",
      "\"May I see you again when Osiris returns to earth, taking with him all those worthy of his servants.\"",
      "\"Until we meet again,\" said Mehy.",
      "Seti didn't speak further -- he had closed his eyes and seemed to be sleeping.",
      "Mehy stood and turned to go.",
      "As he was leaving, he assumed again the youthful appearance of Minos.",
      "At the door he paused.",
      "\"Behold him, \" he whispered as if talking to himself, \"he comes to you without sin, without guilt, without evil, without a witness against him, without one against whom he has taken action.\"",
      "It was part ritual and part eulogy, and as such far more generous than accurate.",
      "But Minos's heart beat loudly as he spoke the words -- his voice cracked with emotion for his friend.",
      "For all the friends that he had lost or was still doomed to lose.",
      "\"He lives on truth and eats of truth.",
      "He has given bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty, clothing to the naked and a boat to him who could not cross the River.\"",
      "And now he departed from Kemetic custom -- and concluded with a prayer that only the gods spoke among themselves, the prayer which could be both curse and blessing: \"May Azrael be tender with you.\"",
      "And then she was on him.",
      "He had descended a steep hill while she, out of breath, hadn't even started hurrying down -- the bull's head turned to look at her.",
      "And then, knowing in her heart that this might be the last chance she got, she did the only thing she could think of and jumped onto him.",
      "How do you catch a god?",
      "You hold onto him.",
      "And you don't let go.",
      "And she was now riding the bull trying to stay on him -- a trick more dangerous than any leap she had attempted during the sport of bull-jumping.",
      "He can throw me off at any moment, a part of her mind was still able to think, and kill me with the simple force of his toss against the rocks.",
      "Let's just assume he won't.",
      "Instead of tossing her away, the bull simply run away at full gallop, and Pasiphae just held on with all her remaining strength.",
      "By the neck, by the horns, by the very hair on the bull's back, by any and every purchase that her hands could find.",
      "In front of her she could see a cliff coming up.",
      "The drop down to the sea below was far too steep for anyone to climb, yet the bull didn't seem to slow down -- didn't seem to even see the drop.",
      "The part of Pasiphae's mind which could still think, wondered whether beneath the bull's form there might now exist an equally bovine intelligence.",
      "No, she thought, for any bull would have tossed you off and killed you.",
      "Trust he won't kill you now, either.",
      "And the bull kept on running until he reached the cliff.",
      "And then he fell over it, Pasiphae still holding onto its neck, and this time no part of her mind was able to think coherently.",
      "And the bull changed.",
      "\"You were correct, then?",
      "About Minos?\" Laodamia asked her son.",
      "\"Yes,\" Sarpedon replied.",
      "Laodamia closed her eyes.",
      "A memory came unbidden to her mind -- herself of long ago, a young woman which Zeus himself was making love to.",
      "Unlike so many other women that the king of the gods had loved, it had not been deceit or force.",
      "It had been freely given and likewise received, as was fitting for the daughter of Bellerophon.",
      "So, she didn't feel loathing at the memory -- but she was still entitled to feel regret.",
      "She sighed.",
      "\"Poor Pasiphae.",
      "May she be able to accept the bitter alongside the sweet.\"",
      "How do you catch a god?",
      "Decades later, the same would be done by a man named Peleus -- capturing a goddess doomed to give birth to one greater than his father, and starting a thread of events which would eventually lead to the downfall of Troy.",
      "Millennia later, a young woman named Janet would manage, in the same way, to claim and win her lover from the Queen of Faerie herself.",
      "You hold onto them.",
      "They'll change into different shapes and forms, they'll become beasts and monsters within your grasp.",
      "They'll turn into fire and burn you, or ice and freeze you.",
      "You'll feel their tremendous power as you hold them, and you'll know that they could kill you in an instant.",
      "You'll get scared.",
      "You'll want to let go.",
      "Don't.",
      "Trust they won't hurt you.",
      "Surrender yourself fully to their power.",
      "Your weakness is your only advantage.",
      "She had closed her eyes against the fall.",
      "She opened them at the sound of wings.",
      "He was now Horus the Elder, the hawk-headed god.",
      "His feathered wings beat behind him, even as she held on from his neck.",
      "In the past she had let herself be carried by sphinxes.",
      "But this creature was no sphinx and the experience was wholly different -- with the sphinxes (whether it was Leader or Golden) she was carried in their arms, and held on to them herself.",
      "The sphinxes had to glide on the currents of the wind and most ascents were slow and steady.",
      "And you also knew that behind the eyes of the sphinxes there existed a friendly humanlike mind which wouldn't let you fall.",
      "But now they were ascending almost vertically with the steady beat of the god's wings, and she held onto him desperately.",
      "And they kept on ascending until she started wondering whether they'd rise so high that she's be burned by the flame of the sun, like wax melts under too hot a fire.",
      "And then Horus started glowing.",
      "He was a solar deity and as such he glowed as bright as the sun at high noon.",
      "Even with her eyes shut the blinding brightness pained her as it pierced her skull.",
      "But she held on.",
      "He changed.",
      "He now turned into a full hawk, but of huge size, and swooped down to the earth.",
      "But she held on.",
      "And then they were back on the earth.",
      "He changed.",
      "He was now a gigantic bull-headed man who ran and thrashed around, but she clung from his neck with all her strength.",
      "He changed.",
      "Back into the full form of bull he turned, and she was still on his back.",
      "She held on.",
      "It was part wrestling, and part courtship.",
      "And suddenly it was over.",
      "He was back in human form, naked in her arms.",
      "And he was looking at her smiling.",
      "\"You are stubborn,\" he said.",
      "\"And I am conquered.\"",
      "And then, in the form of a man, and in the form of a bull, and in an infinite number of forms in between, he made love to her.",
      "The sun set and they awoke, stone fragments flying from their bodies.",
      "And the golden-skinned sphinx wept for joy.",
      "\"I thought I'd lost you...\" The grey boy in her arms smiled at her and passed a hand over her brow-ridges.",
      "\"I thought I...\" she said again but suddenly knew she couldn't continue.",
      "She just leaned her head on his chest for a long minute.",
      "And then she turned and looked at him, and her expression was different from any she ever had before.",
      "It was the red Leader who had advised Creon to ensure their privacy when they next awoke.",
      "\"They may have things to talk about,\" she had simply told him.",
      "Very little talking took place.",
      "It wasn't as either of them had ever expected it to be.",
      "It wasn't that passionate.",
      "It wasn't carefree.",
      "It was a bit awkward, and neither of them had been prepared.",
      "But it was tender.",
      "And it was theirs.",
      "And that would for the moment suffice.",
      "And when they had ended and they rested in each other's arms, Pasiphae, exhausted, slept.",
      "And then she awoke and he was still by her side, holding her in his arms, and they had a long talk about all the things that Minos had hidden from her, and about his long life.",
      "Well... not about all the things.",
      "That would have required years of storytelling.",
      "But about most of the important things concerning him.",
      "Some of them, anyway.",
      "And then, half-jokingly, they decided to choose a name.",
      "\"If it's a boy, I was thinking 'Lycastus'.\"",
      "Pasiphae smiled at him.",
      "\"Lycastus, son of Minos, son-in-law of Lycastus, son of Minos?",
      "Bad idea.\"",
      "Minos laughed.",
      "\"Then... Asterius.\"",
      "Pasiphae nodded, slowly.",
      "\"I think I like the sound of that.",
      "Asterius.\"",
      "But at that moment Minos shuddered and he somehow knew that this wouldn't be the name that their firstborn son would be widely known with.",
      "There will be a price to pay.",
      "1275 BCE: Prices and Punishments Knossos \"Hail the rising Sun, hail the new Moon!",
      "Hail the King and Queen, Minos and Pasiphae!\"",
      "They were married the very same day that Minos was crowned king of Crete; and the two celebrations were merged into one.",
      "Both Sarpedon and Rhadamanthys had withdrawn their own claims for the kingship in favour of Minos, and in public all three swore brotherhood and loyalty to each other.",
      "And then as the darkest part of the night approached, Minos and Pasiphae sneaked away, supposedly to their bedroom -- in reality away from the city and to the mountains.",
      "There they partook into yet a third celebration, smaller perhaps but no less joyful, where two young sphinxes exchanged their mating oaths before the clan.",
      "\"Hello, old friend.",
      "You aren't dancing.\"",
      "Minos didn't turn.",
      "\"It's a dance of youth.\"",

      "The Old Palace, that is.",
      "He had entertained brief notions to have it restored, to return the center of the island's government to where it had once been.",
      "But the old Palace contained now too many ugly memories for the people; and evil superstitions as well, not all of which were necessarily untrue.",
      "So, that plan would have to wait for another time if ever.",
      "Besides, there were too many other things that required doing, much more urgent and much more important.",
      "First of all, he'd have to arrange for a journey throughout the whole of Crete, see the real needs himself-- \"Hey, Minos!",

      "Remember it well.",

    "text": "The hospital corridors were still teeming with people even at this late hour, mainly night staff going about their business, and Philip easily blended in by wearing surgical shirt and pants. He had spent enough time in hospitals during the early stages of his own sickness, being poked and prodded to ascertain how long he had left to live, to be able to mimic the movements and businesslike attitude of a cancer specialist. He paused by the twelfth floor reception desk, flipping through the very convincing looking notes on his clipboard as he waited until all the nurses were fully occupied, then he moved forward swiftly. A quick check of the room charts told him exactly what he needed to know, and he strode off in the direction of Room 1205. Philip opened the door silently and slipped into the room stopping only when he had reached the side of the bed. He gazed down at the small figure, a dagger twisting in his heart at the sight of that disease ravaged body. He felt sick to his own stomach knowing that the serpent had taken away that sickness once, but only so that it could slake its own vile desires on her young body. The chemotherapy had made her gaunt, her ashen, paper-thin skin stretched out over prominent cheek bones. Her beautiful, long red-blond hair was gone - an unfortunate casualty of the radiation treatment. Philip swallowed hard, aware that he wanted to make amends, that he wanted to give her a second chance at life even though he was unsure what the impact of this healing would have on himself. The serpent had always felt drained by the healing it performed, regaining its energy through its heightened sexual appetite. Philip remembered flicking through the entries in the book on Greek mythology and finding other references to drained strength through healing, and his thoughts turned to Telesphorus. --- Telesphorus was a minor deity appointed to assist Asclepius in his healing. He would drain himself of strength each day, lending it to convalescents to carry them through the night when they were closest to death. Each morning his strength renewed itself ready for the day ahead. --- There was no mention of how Telesphorus regained that lost strength each day and he had wondered, momentarily, if that minor deity and the serpent had a similar rejuvenation method. Did Telesphorus regain his strength by taking energy from the living? Would it be the same for him? Would he need to find a willing - or unwilling - partner to restore his strength after a healing? He could not remember feeling any weakness after healing the old woman but then, her ancient body had not been riddled with disease and, at that time, he had been too close to panic to take note of his own physical condition. Philip closed his eyes, his former selfishness and sense of self-preservation vying with his desire to make amends for the terrible crime his body had been forced to commit upon this young woman. My body, but not my mind. He turned away, taking several steps towards the door as he found excuses for not going through with this first true attempt at healing, trying to convince himself that he had been just as much a victim as the girl lying near death's door in that bed. His body and his mind had been abused in every possible way by the serpent god's unwholesome lust. Why should he feel responsible for its actions? Why should he have to atone for its sins? Philip realised he was trembling, his own fear of dying having never truly been conquered, only put into abeyance when the serpent had lifted the disease from his own cancer-ridden body. Could this kill me? Could I give too much of my own strength and not leave enough to save myself? A soft moan of pain filled the quiet room and Philip turned to stare once more at the slight figure on the bed. He felt a sense of shame and compassion rise within him. He did not know for certain if he had the power to heal her, but something deep inside told him that, at the very least, he had to try - even if it meant his own death. Philip moved back to the bed and gently lifted one frail hand. He closed his eyes, unsure of what he needed to do to start the process, his heart going out to the sick girl. A strange tingling filled his body, easing along his nerve endings and reaching out in all directions until he could feel it from the top of his head to the tips of his toes. He saw the disease like a darkness within the girl, his own being flaring like a bright light, piercing that darkness like an arrow and shattering it into a million tiny pieces that were quickly vanquished by the light of his healing. Whatever had happened was over in seconds and Philip collapsed onto the floor beside the bed, his limbs too heavy to hold him, too heavy even to move. Shock held him for a moment as he realised that he was still alive but his senses came crashing back when, above him, he heard the sounds of movement and the soft moans of someone waking as if from a dream. He smiled when he realised there was no pain in those moans but then common sense told him he had to get out of there before she awoke completely. Philip tried to move but he felt too weak even to make an attempt at standing. He started to drag himself across the room towards the open door of the bathroom, hoping to hide in there and buy himself some time to recover before making an attempt to leave the hospital room. There was no way he could avoid being spotted if he tried to drag himself along the corridors. \"Who's there?\" Her voice was soft but laced with a little fear. Philip froze, hoping she would not see him in the semi-darkness of the room, but Rebecca Cassian reached for the light switch. \"You!!\" \"Please... wait!\" He pleaded softly, breathlessly, as he saw her eyes widen in terror and her fingers start to fumble for the call button that would bring a nurse hurrying to her bedside. However, the door opened even before she had managed to find the button and there, on the threshold, stood a young man who bore a strong resemblance to the girl. Philip remembered that Rebecca had a brother... and his fear climbed as Rebecca cried out in fear. \"Jeffrey!\" \"What the fuck!\" The man came forward and grabbed Philip, concern on his face as, wrongfully, he assumed Philip was a doctor who had collapsed in his sister's room. \"It's him. It's Philip Padgett.\" Jeffrey looked up at his sister with a stunned expression but, by the time he looked back down, shock had turned to murderous fury. \"Why you disgusting little piece of perverted shit!\" He dragged Philip up by the front of his shirt, his other hand forming a fist. Philip did not even have the strength to raise his own hands as that fist connected with his face, spraying his blood over both himself and Jeffrey as Philip's nose was broken. The fist came back again, pummeling into his mouth, then splitting the skin over his cheek. In the background Philip could hear Rebecca screaming in terror, and Jeffrey screaming at him in anger. The words ceased to make sense as his senses began to spin, his own body going into shock as those fists continued to pummel into every part of his body... and then it stopped. Philip could still hear Jeffrey cursing him, could still hear Rebecca's sobs but there was another voice too and, through swelling eyes, Philip could see a tall figure trying, unsuccessfully, to hold Jeffrey back. Several hard kicks connected with his abdomen, knocking the air from him and sending him into a world of intense pain, and Philip did his best to force his barely responsive body into a fetal curl, hoping to deflect any further blows. More voices filled the room but Philip was only aware of the hands that dragged at him as he was turned and lifted onto a gurney before being taken away. His world went black and he slipped into welcome unconsciousness, finding death waiting to claim him. -ooOOoo- Philip found himself standing alone on Delos, staring around at the familiar ruins and yet there was something surreal about the whole image. The sun was setting, sinking slowly into the sea, dragging a brilliant red and purple cloak behind it. Philip could hear a hiss as if steam was being released as the fiery mass touched the cool, azure blue water. The temple was plunged into darkness, and every sound was muffled as if smothered by the black mantle of night falling across the ruins. Light flared, suddenly, in the braziers to either side, throwing long shadows across the ruins, tongues of flames licking upwards as if to taste the air around them. A third brazier came to life, throwing flickers of light that gave the great statue of Asclepius the appearance of a living entity. A ground mist flowed from behind the temple pillars, floating over the earth to lap about his feet, writhing and twisting as if alive. The stone serpent which was coiled around the staff of Asclepius seemed to shimmer into life, its broad head lifting, mouth gaping to reveal its wicked, long fangs. Its red eyes fixed upon Philip's and that hiss was heard again. \"Who are you?\" Philip's voice was husky with fear but he stood his ground as the great serpent uncoiled from the staff and slithered towards him. It paused a few feet away, rising up until those red eyes were level with his own. Its forked tongue flicked out and it reared back as if to strike, then froze. \"Podilariusssssss.\" \"No. Podilarius was a man.\" \"Yesssss. Wassss.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"Curssssed.\" \"Cursed? Who is cursed? Me? You?\" \"Ussss. Hadessss.\" \"Hades? But why?\" The serpent struck at Philip but he reacted just as quickly, jumping back out of harm's way, the fangs piercing the very air where he had stood. Philip watched as those red eyes glowed fiercely, alight from an inner madness. The air around him was thick with unwholesome emotion, with hatred, fear and anger vying for supremacy and Philip could sense the malevolence with every fiber of his being. He could smell it in the pungency of the sulfurous air, see its darkness twisting and sliding around him, could hear its sibilant breath upon his cheek as the serpent drifted closer, could feel its coldness slipping across his flesh and raising goosebumps. Philip swallowed hard, his lungs laboring under the weight of the air's putrefaction, desperate to find the answers to his questions and yet afraid of what he would learn. \"Why me? Why am I cursed?\" \"Hyassssinthussss.\" \"I don't understand... No, wait.\" The serpent's form was beginning to fade, the ruins becoming visible through its body as it slowly dissolved into the mist until all that remained was its flaming red eyes. The braziers began to flicker, the flames slowly dying away as a new light spread from the east. Philip's eyes widened in disbelief as the darkness was forced aside by the rising sun. A flare of golden light had him shielding his eyes momentarily, but he eased his fingers aside as a soft voice, full of love, reached out to him. \"Hyacinthus, my beloved.\" Oblivious to the tracks of tears that fell from his light-seared eyes, Philip stared into the beautiful face of the radiant figure, his heart hammering in his chest as he recognized his first lover from Delos. Eyes the colour of a bright summer's day held his own but the figure was slowly being swallowed by the increasing radiance until Philip could no longer bear to look upon the other man. The voice called to him beseechingly, soulful and melodic, guiding him back from the edge of the black abyss. \"Be strong, my beloved. Live. Redemption is at hand. Return to me, my Hyacinthus.\" \"Wait! Who are you?\" The blinding light filled his vision. Philip closed his eyes but the brilliance bled through his eyelids. He could feel the darkness calling to him, voices whispering for him to follow and he fought against them, turning back towards the light that shone through his eyelids. Other voices were starting to drift around him and he focused on the words as the brilliance of the light began to fade to more acceptable levels. -ooOOoo- \"At least we now know what happened to his body.\" A man snorted in response, his voice deep and low, pouring over Philip like dark, melted chocolate. \"Yeah... he wasn't actually dead.\" Images of a dark-skinned man promising wealth in return for a best friend's returned health came back to Philip. Michael... Michael Hale? A woman's voice spoke out, her tone full of remorse and self-directed anger. He knew that voice, had heard it before in his dreams of Mexico. \"I checked his pulse. He *was* dead.\" \"Dr Shiroma, no-one is faulting you. Dr Macase was also convinced he was dead at the time. Obviously, that wasn't the case.\" Philip did not recognize this man's voice and yet a picture formed in his mind of the tall, brown-haired, suit-clad stranger who had arrived on that last day in Mexico. \"Dr Cassian, despite everything this man did, I would never have left him had I thought there was a chance to save him.\" Cassian? Cassian as in Rebecca Cassian? Philip stopped a moan from falling from his lips, memory of punches and hard kicks filling him with renewed fear. Was this the same Cassian who had hurt him? No. The one in Mexico had been older. Perhaps this Cassian was her father. Was he the one who had pulled Jeffrey Cassian away? \"Look, this is getting us nowhere. The fact is... he wasn't dead - obviously.\" \"Michael, I know a dead person when I see one. I am a doctor. And he was dead.\" \"Perhaps he healed himself... brought himself back from the dead. Just like he seems to be doing right now.\" Another voice, and yet this one was even more familiar than the others. He had heard this voice when it was filled with debilitating yet phantom sickness. The image of a dark-haired man with dark eyes dulled by disease and fatigue, came hurtling out of the mists of his memory. He saw the once strong and proud body lay down upon the altar, felt the lust of the serpent rise as it uncoiled itself from around his mind, leaving him alone but paralyzed within the strange mist that curled around him. Strange. Until then the serpent had tended to disregard any males, finding little interest in their bodies, but its desire for this man had been strong. Lying is a disease of the spirit. Had Podilarius, the serpent, performed his unholy healing of this man's spiritual sickness before Philip had fallen into death's welcome embrace? \"What? Tell me you don't believe that nonsense?\" \"Come on, Cassian. No matter how hard we tried to justify it, there was no getting around the fact that those people at his compound were healed of their sickness - by him. Call it spiritual healing, call it mumbo jumbo, hell, call it whatever you like but it was the truth. And what about Rebecca?\" \"Okay, I grant that there is something in it.\" \"She's healed. Her leukemia has gone... and before you start putting that down to the chemotherapy, her notes and blood chemistry, taken only yesterday, I might add, had proved her condition had worsened despite the chemo. Even that horrific mark from his so-called psychic surgery has vanished.\" The man sighed. \"Face it, Cassian. He did something to her. He healed her. What I want to know is - how and why?\" \"He's awake.\" \"Padgett?\" Philip opened his eyes, and then was amazed that he could open his eyes having half expected them to be completely swollen shut from the heavy pounding he had taken to his face. He moaned softly as he remembered, once more, the feel of those fists hitting his vulnerable flesh and the viciousness of those kicks against his soft abdomen. Worst still was his remembrance that he had been too exhausted after trying to heal Rebecca to even put up a hand to protect himself, unable to deflect any of the blows. \"This is incredible, the way those bruises are fading so fast.\" Philip met the dark eyes of the man he had known as Edward Markham, a glance sideways showed him the presence of the beautiful and exotic woman who had pretended to be his girlfriend, and a further glance revealed the so-called best friend, Michael. Two other men were present. The slightly older man was not familiar, but his likeness to Rebecca led Philip to believe this *had* to be the one they had called Dr Cassian. The other man was moving in the background, largely ignored by the others who probably assumed he was part of the nursing staff, but Philip knew different. His whole body thrummed with desire as his gaze fell upon this quiet figure. The body and face were different yet were still handsome, but the mere presence of this man wrapped his fearful heart in a blanket of security as if Philip knew that no harm could befall him while the other was present. This eerily familiar man left the room and Philip tore his gaze away from the receding figure to refocus on the man who leaned over him. The man he had known a Edward Markham gazed down at Philip, the thoughtful expression proving he had seen Philip's recognition of him and two of his colleagues. \"I'm Dr Macase. I'm sure you remember me... and this Dr Shiroma and our associate, Mr Hale. The man you have not met before is Dr Cassian... Rebecca's uncle. I want to...\" \"I'm tired.\" Macase pursed his lips. Philip could see the man had many questions he wanted to ask but the answers were all tangled up inside Philip's head. He needed time to unravel them, time to decipher the true meaning of the vivid dream he had experienced prior to wakening. \"Dr Macase, I suggest we wait and ask those questions in the morning. Give Mr Padgett time to recover.\" Philip could almost feel the indecision that swept through the younger doctor, the dark eyebrows knitting together, but Macase sighed and nodded his agreement. The group of four left the room but Macase was loath to leave altogether and dropped into a seat just outside the door. -ooOOoo- Philip closed his eyes, hoping to gather up the threads of that last dream so he could weave some sense into it. He glanced across at the bedside cabinet, eyes widening as he spotted the book of mythology lying there. Philip was certain he had left it downstairs, concealed among his clothes in a staff locker room. He picked up the book but it was the strong fingers of another that reached across to turn the pages until they stopped at a certain entry. Philip gazed up, heart beating faster when he realised the orderly had returned, but his attention was directed back to the page. --- Zephyrus, god of the west wind, was angry that Hyacinthus preferred the company of the sun god. One day, as Apollo and Hyacinthus were playing quoits, Apollo threw the discus into the air. In his excitement, Hyacinthus sprang forward but a breath of wind from the jealous Zephyrus caused it to strike Hyacinthus upon the head. The boy collapsed. Despite all of Apollo's healing abilities, the injury was beyond the power of medicine and he could not save his beloved. Apollo cried out as the boy died in his arms, begging to take the boy's place - but he was refused. Where the boy's blood ran freely upon the ground, a beautiful purple and silver flower sprang to life in memory of his beautiful Hyacinthus. --- \"I tried to turn you into a flower, so Hades could not claim you for his realm... but he snatched you away while your body was still warm in my arms; such was his resentment against me. Over the millennia I have been pleading my case to have you returned to me - and finally, my father relented.\" \"I don't understand... who are you?\" \"Your soul knows me, no matter what mortal disguise I take. And I have taken many disguises with you.\" The handsome face gazed down at Philip, love shining from the bright green eyes of this latest incarnation, and Philip knew that the man spoke the truth, no matter how incredible it sounded. \"When Hades realised my father was close to relenting, it angered him. He sent you back from Tartarus with no memory of your true self, and placed you in the hands of those who would corrupt your good nature.\" The man closed his eyes, a single tear flowing down his pale cheek. \"When you came to Delos, too close to death before you had fulfilled your part in his revenge upon me, Hades sought out those would save you and yet do me harm. My own flesh and blood. And bent them to his will with promises of vengeance.\" \"Podilarius?\" \"Yes. Hades returned Podilarius in the form of a great serpent.\" The man clasped Philip's hand. \"If I had known you were alive and in my temple on Delos, I would have come for you.\" \"In my dream you said redemption is at hand. Whose redemption?\" \"Yours... and mine. When I learned of Hades subterfuge, after your second death, I petitioned my father and he gave his judgment. If you could redeem yourself before the first sunrise on Delos after the hunter's moon, then I could reclaim you... forever.\" Philip looked into the bright eyes, seeing no fear in them. \"Am I redeemed?\" \"Yes. You were once selfish and uncaring of others, willing to use anyone for your own material gain, or to satisfy your own carnal desires. Since your rebirth you have learned compassion and selflessness. Your willingness to save Rebecca, no matter the physical cost to yourself - that was the final test.\" Philip looked away, his thoughts piercing the shell of his own being as he reflected on all that had happened since awakening on Delos. He remembered how he had come to abhor the person he had once been, ashamed of his former lasciviousness as he saw similar displays by others, shocked by the deceit and by the broken promises made for his own gains. \"And what of you? Are you redeemed?\" The man grinned, his smile like a ray of sunlight. \"I have spent the last four millennia redeeming myself, making myself worthy of you. I have paid for my past arrogance, for my petty jealousies - and for my own licentious behavior. All that remains if for you to know me again.\" \"Who are you?\" The man sighed in frustration. \"I have sworn an oath on the waters of the Styx not to reveal my name to you. It must come from your own lips.\" --- Whenever an important oath was made, Iris, the messenger-goddess, would fly down to Tartarus and return with a vial of water from the Styx. Whoever made the oath drank of this water and the oath became inviolate. If the oath was broken, he who had sworn falsely was thrust into a swoon for nine years. If, after recovering from this swoon, he still failed to honor his oath, he was banished from the company of the gods forever. --- \"You know who I am. Will you not believe?\" \"Apollo.\" The world around him blazed into brightness as the dark-haired orderly was replaced by the golden-haired man he had first met on the slopes of Olympus, thousands of years ago; the same figure that had found him, and loved him, on Delos. The sun god smiled, and the final veil of mist fell from Philip's eyes. Memories flooded back to him, days full of laughter and loving, held in those strong arms as they played games and hunted through the mountain slopes, side by side. That last day came back to him, the discus sailing high into the air as he ran forward, eager to pick it up from where it fell so he could take his turn. A gust of wind on an, otherwise, calm day sent the discus astray and it fell, striking the ground in front of him and bouncing up to strike him hard across the forehead. Philip recalled how a darkness that was not all in his own mind had fallen across the land as he felt Hades minions snatch at his spirit. He remembered crying out for his beloved Apollo as the sun was covered by his sister, the moon, the terrible blackness of grief falling over the world as Philip was dragged towards the Styx to find Charon, the ferryman, waiting with his withered hand requesting no payment for that final crossing. His soul had wandered the Elysian Fields in sorrow, unable to forget for the waters of the river Lethe had been withheld from him. He petitioned Hades constantly, but his pleas to be returned to his beloved Apollo were ignored, and Hades had drank his tears as if they were the finest wine. Then, unexpectedly, Hades had relented, agreeing to return him to the upper world on one condition, that he drank a full measure of water from the Lethe before leaving Hades realm. Philip saw his second mortal existence flash before his eyes. Every crucial turning point in his life seemed to have been manipulated by one person or another. His own parents had encouraged his unhealthy taste in pornography from an early age. They had spent most of their lives negating homosexuality in any form, stressing over and over the perfection of the female form, convincing him that the scenes acted out in a porn video were real, until he could not tell the difference between lust and love. In hindsight, Philip realised that he had rarely found satisfaction when masturbating to the sight of women. His heart would start to beat wildly, the blood pool in his groin only when the male appeared on the scene; his lust driven by that man's reactions. His first employer had taught him how to lie professionally, and how to twist the truth, proclaiming it a necessary skill for selling insurance. He learned how to prey upon the fears of others, how to confuse and misdirect in order to get the vital signature on the document. Even though he had leaned how to manipulate, he had never become an expert at this craft. All too often he would get those clients to sign up to a lesser deal, half sickened with himself for this moment of weakness. He had even forgotten to push through the paperwork on occasion, convincing himself that he did so because he did not give a damn about those people rather than admit that he felt guilty and ashamed of his subterfuge. What money he earned was spent recklessly on material goods; fast cars, good wine, the latest fashions and hottest music. His girlfriend had encouraged him in that attitude until he was surrounded by beautiful objects, and beautiful people. He had come to live far beyond his means, his debts rising, uncaring of the demands for repayment from credit companies. Yet, for all this material wealth, for all the parties and time spent rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous, Philip believed his times traveling since Delos, with just a backpack over his shoulders, to have been the happiest moments of his short life. Philip reached out, his fingers trailing the length of the strong jaw before skimming across the full lips. Long fingers clasped his wrist, holding his forefinger against the parting lips as a pink tongue slid across the pad before sucking it inside. Sharp white teeth grazed along the length of his finger as his finger was suckled. Azure blue eyes blazed with love for him and Philip melted into that gaze with equal passion as his mind finally became one with his body in remembrance, finally reunited with his beloved. Philip threw back his head as the heady sensations of desire flooded through him, then felt himself being lifted into powerful arms. The sterile hospital room began to fade, his eyes alighting on the awe-filled Macase, standing on the threshold of the room, for a moment in time before he felt his body being lowered onto a bed of purple and silver larkspur. Above him the cloudless sky was as blue as his lover's eyes and the air was thick with the scent of honeysuckle and roses. A gentle west wind caressed Philip's skin as Zephyrus blessed the reunion of Apollo with his Hyacinthus, the wind deity's heart having finally been melted by his own beloved, Chloris. The soft breeze rustled the leaves in the tall trees, the hushing sound in harmony with the tinkling of water flowing over pebbles in a small babbling brook. High above, the song of birds filled the air, mingling with the gentle humming of bees as they flit from flower to flower. Philip stretched, luxuriating in the warmth of the sun upon his face. No shadow fell across him as his beloved hovered over him, the radiance of that countenance more glorious than the sun crossing the heavens. He sighed as his lips were taken in the sweetest of kisses, full of love and affection, his breath mingling with his lover's as their tongues caressed and entwined. The mouth moved lower, tracing a path of fire down his offered throat, gliding across the sunburst tattoo before drawing that flesh inside and sucking hard. Frissons of energy danced along his nerve endings, sending licks of fire through his body. When Apollo pulled back, Philip reached out to card his fingers through the golden locks of hair that fell like a curtain around the beautiful face, mesmerized by the kiss-swollen lips that promised even greater passion. The hospital gown was stripped from his body, and Philip waited in eager anticipation as Apollo released the clasp that held his own clothing. He moaned as Apollo lowered himself over his naked body, enraptured by the sensation of flesh sliding against flesh, his breath catching as he felt the hardened silken steel shaft of his lover press against his own equally rampant flesh. His body was rolled until he lay on top, reveling in the feel of knowing hands stroking the length of his flanks, cupping his ass cheeks and kneading the firm muscle. He moaned as his cheeks were spread, his hips wriggling against his lover's hardened flesh as a finger rimmed the small entrance to his body before gently pushing inside. Philip gasped as that finger was joined by another, both moving easily within him, stretching the tight muscle and stroking the soft inner wall. He cried out as they brushed across that special place deep inside, his hips bucking against his lover, his shaft gliding easily across the firm belly in the slickness of precome. All too soon, those fingers pulled away, leaving him desolate. His hips were grasped, his body raised and then lowered. Philip felt the blunt head of his lover's shaft against the loosened muscle and sank willingly onto that hardened flesh, gasping anew as the firm head stroked across that sensitive gland. Philip paused when he could take no more inside, his ass pressed tight against his lover's groin, feeling the crisp golden hairs against the sensitive skin of his perineum and sac. He writhed, muscles clamping around the welcome intruder, enjoying the sensation of being filled. He raised his body, enjoying the slide of that shaft as it left his body, stopping when only the head was still inside then, allowing gravity and his own weight to dictate his movements, he dropped back onto the silken steel shaft. Below him, his lover was breathing hard, small gasps of pleasure falling from the parted lips, those lust-darkened eyes glazing over in passion. A hand left one of his hips to grasp Philip's erection, the warm fingers curling tightly about the shaft, thumb rubbing across the tip smearing the precome over the sensitive glans. Philip gasped as new spikes of lust speared through him, igniting his whole body. They moved together in perfect harmony, bodies rising and falling, muscles tightening and relaxing as sensations, running like liquid fire through their close-pressed bodies, slowly built until they were burning, their senses overloading as their nerve endings were seared by the intensity of the fires raging within them. Molten heat filled Philip as his lover came deep inside him, his own pleasure spilling out to splatter across the almost hairless abdomen and chest. Philip collapsed upon his lover, his satiated body wrapped in strong arms, body tingling in the warmth of the afterglow as he was rolled onto his side, his face smothered in less passionate but no less loving licks and kisses. Philip lay with his arm possessively slung across the broad expanse of chest, his fingers toying with the hardened peak of a nipple. Soft words of love were whispered into his ear as he drifted off, still wrapped in that firm embrace, his body and mind finally at peace, knowing he was where he belonged - safe and warm in his beloved's arms... forever.

    "sentences": [
      "The hospital corridors were still teeming with people even at this late hour, mainly night staff going about their business, and Philip easily blended in by wearing surgical shirt and pants.",
      "He had spent enough time in hospitals during the early stages of his own sickness, being poked and prodded to ascertain how long he had left to live, to be able to mimic the movements and businesslike attitude of a cancer specialist.",
      "He paused by the twelfth floor reception desk, flipping through the very convincing looking notes on his clipboard as he waited until all the nurses were fully occupied, then he moved forward swiftly.",
      "A quick check of the room charts told him exactly what he needed to know, and he strode off in the direction of Room 1205.",
      "Philip opened the door silently and slipped into the room stopping only when he had reached the side of the bed.",
      "He gazed down at the small figure, a dagger twisting in his heart at the sight of that disease ravaged body.",
      "He felt sick to his own stomach knowing that the serpent had taken away that sickness once, but only so that it could slake its own vile desires on her young body.",
      "The chemotherapy had made her gaunt, her ashen, paper-thin skin stretched out over prominent cheek bones.",
      "Her beautiful, long red-blond hair was gone - an unfortunate casualty of the radiation treatment.",
      "Philip swallowed hard, aware that he wanted to make amends, that he wanted to give her a second chance at life even though he was unsure what the impact of this healing would have on himself.",
      "The serpent had always felt drained by the healing it performed, regaining its energy through its heightened sexual appetite.",
      "Philip remembered flicking through the entries in the book on Greek mythology and finding other references to drained strength through healing, and his thoughts turned to Telesphorus.",
      "--- Telesphorus was a minor deity appointed to assist Asclepius in his healing.",
      "He would drain himself of strength each day, lending it to convalescents to carry them through the night when they were closest to death.",
      "Each morning his strength renewed itself ready for the day ahead.",
      "--- There was no mention of how Telesphorus regained that lost strength each day and he had wondered, momentarily, if that minor deity and the serpent had a similar rejuvenation method.",
      "Did Telesphorus regain his strength by taking energy from the living?",
      "Would it be the same for him?",
      "Would he need to find a willing - or unwilling - partner to restore his strength after a healing?",
      "He could not remember feeling any weakness after healing the old woman but then, her ancient body had not been riddled with disease and, at that time, he had been too close to panic to take note of his own physical condition.",
      "Philip closed his eyes, his former selfishness and sense of self-preservation vying with his desire to make amends for the terrible crime his body had been forced to commit upon this young woman.",
      "My body, but not my mind.",
      "He turned away, taking several steps towards the door as he found excuses for not going through with this first true attempt at healing, trying to convince himself that he had been just as much a victim as the girl lying near death's door in that bed.",
      "His body and his mind had been abused in every possible way by the serpent god's unwholesome lust.",
      "Why should he feel responsible for its actions?",
      "Why should he have to atone for its sins?",
      "Philip realised he was trembling, his own fear of dying having never truly been conquered, only put into abeyance when the serpent had lifted the disease from his own cancer-ridden body.",
      "Could this kill me?",
      "Could I give too much of my own strength and not leave enough to save myself?",
      "A soft moan of pain filled the quiet room and Philip turned to stare once more at the slight figure on the bed.",
      "He felt a sense of shame and compassion rise within him.",
      "He did not know for certain if he had the power to heal her, but something deep inside told him that, at the very least, he had to try - even if it meant his own death.",
      "Philip moved back to the bed and gently lifted one frail hand.",
      "He closed his eyes, unsure of what he needed to do to start the process, his heart going out to the sick girl.",
      "A strange tingling filled his body, easing along his nerve endings and reaching out in all directions until he could feel it from the top of his head to the tips of his toes.",
      "He saw the disease like a darkness within the girl, his own being flaring like a bright light, piercing that darkness like an arrow and shattering it into a million tiny pieces that were quickly vanquished by the light of his healing.",
      "Whatever had happened was over in seconds and Philip collapsed onto the floor beside the bed, his limbs too heavy to hold him, too heavy even to move.",
      "Shock held him for a moment as he realised that he was still alive but his senses came crashing back when, above him, he heard the sounds of movement and the soft moans of someone waking as if from a dream.",
      "He smiled when he realised there was no pain in those moans but then common sense told him he had to get out of there before she awoke completely.",
      "Philip tried to move but he felt too weak even to make an attempt at standing.",
      "He started to drag himself across the room towards the open door of the bathroom, hoping to hide in there and buy himself some time to recover before making an attempt to leave the hospital room.",
      "There was no way he could avoid being spotted if he tried to drag himself along the corridors.",
      "\"Who's there?\"",
      "Her voice was soft but laced with a little fear.",
      "Philip froze, hoping she would not see him in the semi-darkness of the room, but Rebecca Cassian reached for the light switch.",
      "\"You!!\"",
      "\"Please... wait!\"",
      "He pleaded softly, breathlessly, as he saw her eyes widen in terror and her fingers start to fumble for the call button that would bring a nurse hurrying to her bedside.",
      "However, the door opened even before she had managed to find the button and there, on the threshold, stood a young man who bore a strong resemblance to the girl.",
      "Philip remembered that Rebecca had a brother... and his fear climbed as Rebecca cried out in fear.",
      "\"Jeffrey!\"",
      "\"What the fuck!\"",
      "The man came forward and grabbed Philip, concern on his face as, wrongfully, he assumed Philip was a doctor who had collapsed in his sister's room.",
      "\"It's him.",
      "It's Philip Padgett.\"",
      "Jeffrey looked up at his sister with a stunned expression but, by the time he looked back down, shock had turned to murderous fury.",
      "\"Why you disgusting little piece of perverted shit!\"",
      "He dragged Philip up by the front of his shirt, his other hand forming a fist.",
      "Philip did not even have the strength to raise his own hands as that fist connected with his face, spraying his blood over both himself and Jeffrey as Philip's nose was broken.",
      "The fist came back again, pummeling into his mouth, then splitting the skin over his cheek.",
      "In the background Philip could hear Rebecca screaming in terror, and Jeffrey screaming at him in anger.",
      "The words ceased to make sense as his senses began to spin, his own body going into shock as those fists continued to pummel into every part of his body... and then it stopped.",
      "Philip could still hear Jeffrey cursing him, could still hear Rebecca's sobs but there was another voice too and, through swelling eyes, Philip could see a tall figure trying, unsuccessfully, to hold Jeffrey back.",
      "Several hard kicks connected with his abdomen, knocking the air from him and sending him into a world of intense pain, and Philip did his best to force his barely responsive body into a fetal curl, hoping to deflect any further blows.",
      "More voices filled the room but Philip was only aware of the hands that dragged at him as he was turned and lifted onto a gurney before being taken away.",
      "His world went black and he slipped into welcome unconsciousness, finding death waiting to claim him.",
      "-ooOOoo- Philip found himself standing alone on Delos, staring around at the familiar ruins and yet there was something surreal about the whole image.",
      "The sun was setting, sinking slowly into the sea, dragging a brilliant red and purple cloak behind it.",
      "Philip could hear a hiss as if steam was being released as the fiery mass touched the cool, azure blue water.",
      "The temple was plunged into darkness, and every sound was muffled as if smothered by the black mantle of night falling across the ruins.",
      "Light flared, suddenly, in the braziers to either side, throwing long shadows across the ruins, tongues of flames licking upwards as if to taste the air around them.",
      "A third brazier came to life, throwing flickers of light that gave the great statue of Asclepius the appearance of a living entity.",
      "A ground mist flowed from behind the temple pillars, floating over the earth to lap about his feet, writhing and twisting as if alive.",
      "The stone serpent which was coiled around the staff of Asclepius seemed to shimmer into life, its broad head lifting, mouth gaping to reveal its wicked, long fangs.",
      "Its red eyes fixed upon Philip's and that hiss was heard again.",
      "\"Who are you?\" Philip's voice was husky with fear but he stood his ground as the great serpent uncoiled from the staff and slithered towards him.",
      "It paused a few feet away, rising up until those red eyes were level with his own.",
      "Its forked tongue flicked out and it reared back as if to strike, then froze.",
      "\"Podilariusssssss.\"",
      "\"No. Podilarius was a man.\"",
      "\"Yesssss.",
      "Wassss.\"",
      "\"I don't understand.\"",
      "\"Curssssed.\"",
      "\"Cursed?",
      "Who is cursed?",
      "Me?",
      "You?\" \"Ussss.",
      "Hadessss.\"",
      "\"Hades?",
      "But why?\"",
      "The serpent struck at Philip but he reacted just as quickly, jumping back out of harm's way, the fangs piercing the very air where he had stood.",
      "Philip watched as those red eyes glowed fiercely, alight from an inner madness.",
      "The air around him was thick with unwholesome emotion, with hatred, fear and anger vying for supremacy and Philip could sense the malevolence with every fiber of his being.",
      "He could smell it in the pungency of the sulfurous air, see its darkness twisting and sliding around him, could hear its sibilant breath upon his cheek as the serpent drifted closer, could feel its coldness slipping across his flesh and raising goosebumps.",
      "Philip swallowed hard, his lungs laboring under the weight of the air's putrefaction, desperate to find the answers to his questions and yet afraid of what he would learn.",
      "\"Why me?",
      "Why am I cursed?\" \"Hyassssinthussss.\"",
      "\"I don't understand...",
      "No, wait.\"",
      "The serpent's form was beginning to fade, the ruins becoming visible through its body as it slowly dissolved into the mist until all that remained was its flaming red eyes.",
      "The braziers began to flicker, the flames slowly dying away as a new light spread from the east.",
      "Philip's eyes widened in disbelief as the darkness was forced aside by the rising sun.",
      "A flare of golden light had him shielding his eyes momentarily, but he eased his fingers aside as a soft voice, full of love, reached out to him.",
      "\"Hyacinthus, my beloved.\"",
      "Oblivious to the tracks of tears that fell from his light-seared eyes, Philip stared into the beautiful face of the radiant figure, his heart hammering in his chest as he recognized his first lover from Delos.",
      "Eyes the colour of a bright summer's day held his own but the figure was slowly being swallowed by the increasing radiance until Philip could no longer bear to look upon the other man.",
      "The voice called to him beseechingly, soulful and melodic, guiding him back from the edge of the black abyss.",
      "\"Be strong, my beloved.",
      "Live.",
      "Redemption is at hand.",
      "Return to me, my Hyacinthus.\"",
      "\"Wait!",
      "Who are you?\"",
      "The blinding light filled his vision.",
      "Philip closed his eyes but the brilliance bled through his eyelids.",
      "He could feel the darkness calling to him, voices whispering for him to follow and he fought against them, turning back towards the light that shone through his eyelids.",
      "Other voices were starting to drift around him and he focused on the words as the brilliance of the light began to fade to more acceptable levels.",
      "-ooOOoo- \"At least we now know what happened to his body.\"",
      "A man snorted in response, his voice deep and low, pouring over Philip like dark, melted chocolate.",
      "\"Yeah... he wasn't actually dead.\"",
      "Images of a dark-skinned man promising wealth in return for a best friend's returned health came back to Philip.",
      "Michael...",
      "Michael Hale?",
      "A woman's voice spoke out, her tone full of remorse and self-directed anger.",
      "He knew that voice, had heard it before in his dreams of Mexico.",
      "\"I checked his pulse.",
      "He *was* dead.\"",
      "\"Dr Shiroma, no-one is faulting you.",
      "Dr Macase was also convinced he was dead at the time.",
      "Obviously, that wasn't the case.\"",
      "Philip did not recognize this man's voice and yet a picture formed in his mind of the tall, brown-haired, suit-clad stranger who had arrived on that last day in Mexico.",
      "\"Dr Cassian, despite everything this man did, I would never have left him had I thought there was a chance to save him.\"",
      "Cassian?",
      "Cassian as in Rebecca Cassian?",
      "Philip stopped a moan from falling from his lips, memory of punches and hard kicks filling him with renewed fear.",
      "Was this the same Cassian who had hurt him?",
      "No",
      ".",
      "The one in Mexico had been older.",
      "Perhaps this Cassian was her father.",
      "Was he the one who had pulled Jeffrey Cassian away?",
      "\"Look, this is getting us nowhere.",
      "The fact is... he wasn't dead - obviously.\"",
      "\"Michael, I know a dead person when I see one.",
      "I am a doctor.",
      "And he was dead.\"",
      "\"Perhaps he healed himself... brought himself back from the dead.",
      "Just like he seems to be doing right now.\"",
      "Another voice, and yet this one was even more familiar than the others.",
      "He had heard this voice when it was filled with debilitating yet phantom sickness.",
      "The image of a dark-haired man with dark eyes dulled by disease and fatigue, came hurtling out of the mists of his memory.",
      "He saw the once strong and proud body lay down upon the altar, felt the lust of the serpent rise as it uncoiled itself from around his mind, leaving him alone but paralyzed within the strange mist that curled around him.",
      "Strange.",
      "Until then the serpent had tended to disregard any males, finding little interest in their bodies, but its desire for this man had been strong.",
      "Lying is a disease of the spirit.",
      "Had Podilarius, the serpent, performed his unholy healing of this man's spiritual sickness before Philip had fallen into death's welcome embrace?",
      "\"What?",
      "Tell me you don't believe that nonsense?\"",
      "\"Come on, Cassian.",
      "No matter how hard we tried to justify it, there was no getting around the fact that those people at his compound were healed of their sickness - by him.",
      "Call it spiritual healing, call it mumbo jumbo, hell, call it whatever you like but it was the truth.",
      "And what about Rebecca?\" \"Okay, I grant that there is something in it.\"",
      "\"She's healed.",
      "Her leukemia has gone... and before you start putting that down to the chemotherapy, her notes and blood chemistry, taken only yesterday, I might add, had proved her condition had worsened despite the chemo.",
      "Even that horrific mark from his so-called psychic surgery has vanished.\"",
      "The man sighed.",
      "\"Face it, Cassian.",
      "He did something to her.",
      "He healed her.",
      "What I want to know is - how and why?\"",
      "\"He's awake.\"",
      "\"Padgett?\" Philip opened his eyes, and then was amazed that he could open his eyes having half expected them to be completely swollen shut from the heavy pounding he had taken to his face.",
      "He moaned softly as he remembered, once more, the feel of those fists hitting his vulnerable flesh and the viciousness of those kicks against his soft abdomen.",
      "Worst still was his remembrance that he had been too exhausted after trying to heal Rebecca to even put up a hand to protect himself, unable to deflect any of the blows.",
      "\"This is incredible, the way those bruises are fading so fast.\"",
      "Philip met the dark eyes of the man he had known as Edward Markham, a glance sideways showed him the presence of the beautiful and exotic woman who had pretended to be his girlfriend, and a further glance revealed the so-called best friend, Michael.",
      "Two other men were present.",
      "The slightly older man was not familiar, but his likeness to Rebecca led Philip to believe this *had* to be the one they had called Dr Cassian.",
      "The other man was moving in the background, largely ignored by the others who probably assumed he was part of the nursing staff, but Philip knew different.",
      "His whole body thrummed with desire as his gaze fell upon this quiet figure.",
      "The body and face were different yet were still handsome, but the mere presence of this man wrapped his fearful heart in a blanket of security as if Philip knew that no harm could befall him while the other was present.",
      "This eerily familiar man left the room and Philip tore his gaze away from the receding figure to refocus on the man who leaned over him.",
      "The man he had known a Edward Markham gazed down at Philip, the thoughtful expression proving he had seen Philip's recognition of him and two of his colleagues.",
      "\"I'm Dr Macase.",
      "I'm sure you remember me... and this Dr Shiroma and our associate, Mr Hale.",
      "The man you have not met before is Dr Cassian... Rebecca's uncle.",
      "I want to...\" \"I'm tired.\"",
      "Macase pursed his lips.",
      "Philip could see the man had many questions he wanted to ask but the answers were all tangled up inside Philip's head.",
      "He needed time to unravel them, time to decipher the true meaning of the vivid dream he had experienced prior to wakening.",
      "\"Dr Macase, I suggest we wait and ask those questions in the morning.",
      "Give Mr Padgett time to recover.\"",
      "Philip could almost feel the indecision that swept through the younger doctor, the dark eyebrows knitting together, but Macase sighed and nodded his agreement.",
      "The group of four left the room but Macase was loath to leave altogether and dropped into a seat just outside the door.",
      "-ooOOoo- Philip closed his eyes, hoping to gather up the threads of that last dream so he could weave some sense into it.",
      "He glanced across at the bedside cabinet, eyes widening as he spotted the book of mythology lying there.",
      "Philip was certain he had left it downstairs, concealed among his clothes in a staff locker room.",
      "He picked up the book but it was the strong fingers of another that reached across to turn the pages until they stopped at a certain entry.",
      "Philip gazed up, heart beating faster when he realised the orderly had returned, but his attention was directed back to the page.",
      "--- Zephyrus, god of the west wind, was angry that Hyacinthus preferred the company of the sun god.",
      "One day, as Apollo and Hyacinthus were playing quoits, Apollo threw the discus into the air.",
      "In his excitement, Hyacinthus sprang forward but a breath of wind from the jealous Zephyrus caused it to strike Hyacinthus upon the head.",
      "The boy collapsed.",
      "Despite all of Apollo's healing abilities, the injury was beyond the power of medicine and he could not save his beloved.",
      "Apollo cried out as the boy died in his arms, begging to take the boy's place - but he was refused.",
      "Where the boy's blood ran freely upon the ground, a beautiful purple and silver flower sprang to life in memory of his beautiful Hyacinthus.",
      "--- \"I tried to turn you into a flower, so Hades could not claim you for his realm...",
      "but he snatched you away while your body was still warm in my arms; such was his resentment against me.",
      "Over the millennia I have been pleading my case to have you returned to me - and finally, my father relented.\"",
      "\"I don't understand... who are you?\"",
      "\"Your soul knows me, no matter what mortal disguise I take.",
      "And I have taken many disguises with you.\"",
      "The handsome face gazed down at Philip, love shining from the bright green eyes of this latest incarnation, and Philip knew that the man spoke the truth, no matter how incredible it sounded.",
      "\"When Hades realised my father was close to relenting, it angered him.",
      "He sent you back from Tartarus with no memory of your true self, and placed you in the hands of those who would corrupt your good nature.\"",
      "The man closed his eyes, a single tear flowing down his pale cheek.",
      "\"When you came to Delos, too close to death before you had fulfilled your part in his revenge upon me, Hades sought out those would save you and yet do me harm.",
      "My own flesh and blood.",
      "And bent them to his will with promises of vengeance.\"",
      "\"Podilarius?\"",
      "\"Yes.",
      "Hades returned Podilarius in the form of a great serpent.\"",
      "The man clasped Philip's hand.",
      "\"If I had known you were alive and in my temple on Delos, I would have come for you.\"",
      "\"In my dream you said redemption is at hand.",
      "Whose redemption?\" \"Yours... and mine.",
      "When I learned of Hades subterfuge, after your second death, I petitioned my father and he gave his judgment.",
      "If you could redeem yourself before the first sunrise on Delos after the hunter's moon, then I could reclaim you... forever.\"",
      "Philip looked into the bright eyes, seeing no fear in them.",
      "\"Am I redeemed?\"",
      "\"Yes.",
      "You were once selfish and uncaring of others, willing to use anyone for your own material gain, or to satisfy your own carnal desires.",
      "Since your rebirth you have learned compassion and selflessness.",
      "Your willingness to save Rebecca, no matter the physical cost to yourself - that was the final test.\"",
      "Philip looked away, his thoughts piercing the shell of his own being as he reflected on all that had happened since awakening on Delos.",
      "He remembered how he had come to abhor the person he had once been, ashamed of his former lasciviousness as he saw similar displays by others, shocked by the deceit and by the broken promises made for his own gains.",
      "\"And what of you?",
      "Are you redeemed?\"",
      "The man grinned, his smile like a ray of sunlight.",
      "\"I have spent the last four millennia redeeming myself, making myself worthy of you.",
      "I have paid for my past arrogance, for my petty jealousies - and for my own licentious behavior.",
      "All that remains if for you to know me again.\"",
      "\"Who are you?\"",
      "The man sighed in frustration.",
      "\"I have sworn an oath on the waters of the Styx not to reveal my name to you.",
      "It must come from your own lips.\"",
      "--- Whenever an important oath was made, Iris, the messenger-goddess, would fly down to Tartarus and return with a vial of water from the Styx.",
      "Whoever made the oath drank of this water and the oath became inviolate.",
      "If the oath was broken, he who had sworn falsely was thrust into a swoon for nine years.",
      "If, after recovering from this swoon, he still failed to honor his oath, he was banished from the company of the gods forever.",
      "--- \"You know who I am.",
      "Will you not believe?\" \"Apollo.\"",
      "The world around him blazed into brightness as the dark-haired orderly was replaced by the golden-haired man he had first met on the slopes of Olympus, thousands of years ago; the same figure that had found him, and loved him, on Delos.",
      "The sun god smiled, and the final veil of mist fell from Philip's eyes.",
      "Memories flooded back to him, days full of laughter and loving, held in those strong arms as they played games and hunted through the mountain slopes, side by side.",
      "That last day came back to him, the discus sailing high into the air as he ran forward, eager to pick it up from where it fell so he could take his turn.",
      "A gust of wind on an, otherwise, calm day sent the discus astray and it fell, striking the ground in front of him and bouncing up to strike him hard across the forehead.",
      "Philip recalled how a darkness that was not all in his own mind had fallen across the land as he felt Hades minions snatch at his spirit.",
      "He remembered crying out for his beloved Apollo as the sun was covered by his sister, the moon, the terrible blackness of grief falling over the world as Philip was dragged towards the Styx to find Charon, the ferryman, waiting with his withered hand requesting no payment for that final crossing.",
      "His soul had wandered the Elysian Fields in sorrow, unable to forget for the waters of the river Lethe had been withheld from him.",
      "He petitioned Hades constantly, but his pleas to be returned to his beloved Apollo were ignored, and Hades had drank his tears as if they were the finest wine.",
      "Then, unexpectedly, Hades had relented, agreeing to return him to the upper world on one condition, that he drank a full measure of water from the Lethe before leaving Hades realm.",
      "Philip saw his second mortal existence flash before his eyes.",
      "Every crucial turning point in his life seemed to have been manipulated by one person or another.",
      "His own parents had encouraged his unhealthy taste in pornography from an early age.",
      "They had spent most of their lives negating homosexuality in any form, stressing over and over the perfection of the female form, convincing him that the scenes acted out in a porn video were real, until he could not tell the difference between lust and love.",
      "In hindsight, Philip realised that he had rarely found satisfaction when masturbating to the sight of women.",
      "His heart would start to beat wildly, the blood pool in his groin only when the male appeared on the scene; his lust driven by that man's reactions.",
      "His first employer had taught him how to lie professionally, and how to twist the truth, proclaiming it a necessary skill for selling insurance.",
      "He learned how to prey upon the fears of others, how to confuse and misdirect in order to get the vital signature on the document.",
      "Even though he had leaned how to manipulate, he had never become an expert at this craft.",
      "All too often he would get those clients to sign up to a lesser deal, half sickened with himself for this moment of weakness.",
      "He had even forgotten to push through the paperwork on occasion, convincing himself that he did so because he did not give a damn about those people rather than admit that he felt guilty and ashamed of his subterfuge.",
      "What money he earned was spent recklessly on material goods; fast cars, good wine, the latest fashions and hottest music.",
      "His girlfriend had encouraged him in that attitude until he was surrounded by beautiful objects, and beautiful people.",
      "He had come to live far beyond his means, his debts rising, uncaring of the demands for repayment from credit companies.",
      "Yet, for all this material wealth, for all the parties and time spent rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous, Philip believed his times traveling since Delos, with just a backpack over his shoulders, to have been the happiest moments of his short life.",
      "Philip reached out, his fingers trailing the length of the strong jaw before skimming across the full lips.",
      "Long fingers clasped his wrist, holding his forefinger against the parting lips as a pink tongue slid across the pad before sucking it inside.",
      "Sharp white teeth grazed along the length of his finger as his finger was suckled.",
      "Azure blue eyes blazed with love for him and Philip melted into that gaze with equal passion as his mind finally became one with his body in remembrance, finally reunited with his beloved.",
      "Philip threw back his head as the heady sensations of desire flooded through him, then felt himself being lifted into powerful arms.",
      "The sterile hospital room began to fade, his eyes alighting on the awe-filled Macase, standing on the threshold of the room, for a moment in time before he felt his body being lowered onto a bed of purple and silver larkspur.",
      "Above him the cloudless sky was as blue as his lover's eyes and the air was thick with the scent of honeysuckle and roses.",
      "A gentle west wind caressed Philip's skin as Zephyrus blessed the reunion of Apollo with his Hyacinthus, the wind deity's heart having finally been melted by his own beloved, Chloris.",
      "The soft breeze rustled the leaves in the tall trees, the hushing sound in harmony with the tinkling of water flowing over pebbles in a small babbling brook.",
      "High above, the song of birds filled the air, mingling with the gentle humming of bees as they flit from flower to flower.",
      "Philip stretched, luxuriating in the warmth of the sun upon his face.",
      "No shadow fell across him as his beloved hovered over him, the radiance of that countenance more glorious than the sun crossing the heavens.",
      "He sighed as his lips were taken in the sweetest of kisses, full of love and affection, his breath mingling with his lover's as their tongues caressed and entwined.",
      "The mouth moved lower, tracing a path of fire down his offered throat, gliding across the sunburst tattoo before drawing that flesh inside and sucking hard.",
      "Frissons of energy danced along his nerve endings, sending licks of fire through his body.",
      "When Apollo pulled back, Philip reached out to card his fingers through the golden locks of hair that fell like a curtain around the beautiful face, mesmerized by the kiss-swollen lips that promised even greater passion.",
      "The hospital gown was stripped from his body, and Philip waited in eager anticipation as Apollo released the clasp that held his own clothing.",
      "He moaned as Apollo lowered himself over his naked body, enraptured by the sensation of flesh sliding against flesh, his breath catching as he felt the hardened silken steel shaft of his lover press against his own equally rampant flesh.",
      "His body was rolled until he lay on top, reveling in the feel of knowing hands stroking the length of his flanks, cupping his ass cheeks and kneading the firm muscle.",
      "He moaned as his cheeks were spread, his hips wriggling against his lover's hardened flesh as a finger rimmed the small entrance to his body before gently pushing inside.",
      "Philip gasped as that finger was joined by another, both moving easily within him, stretching the tight muscle and stroking the soft inner wall.",
      "He cried out as they brushed across that special place deep inside, his hips bucking against his lover, his shaft gliding easily across the firm belly in the slickness of precome.",
      "All too soon, those fingers pulled away, leaving him desolate.",
      "His hips were grasped, his body raised and then lowered.",
      "Philip felt the blunt head of his lover's shaft against the loosened muscle and sank willingly onto that hardened flesh, gasping anew as the firm head stroked across that sensitive gland.",
      "Philip paused when he could take no more inside, his ass pressed tight against his lover's groin, feeling the crisp golden hairs against the sensitive skin of his perineum and sac.",
      "He writhed, muscles clamping around the welcome intruder, enjoying the sensation of being filled.",
      "He raised his body, enjoying the slide of that shaft as it left his body, stopping when only the head was still inside then, allowing gravity and his own weight to dictate his movements, he dropped back onto the silken steel shaft.",
      "Below him, his lover was breathing hard, small gasps of pleasure falling from the parted lips, those lust-darkened eyes glazing over in passion.",
      "A hand left one of his hips to grasp Philip's erection, the warm fingers curling tightly about the shaft, thumb rubbing across the tip smearing the precome over the sensitive glans.",
      "Philip gasped as new spikes of lust speared through him, igniting his whole body.",
      "They moved together in perfect harmony, bodies rising and falling, muscles tightening and relaxing as sensations, running like liquid fire through their close-pressed bodies, slowly built until they were burning, their senses overloading as their nerve endings were seared by the intensity of the fires raging within them.",
      "Molten heat filled Philip as his lover came deep inside him, his own pleasure spilling out to splatter across the almost hairless abdomen and chest.",
      "Philip collapsed upon his lover, his satiated body wrapped in strong arms, body tingling in the warmth of the afterglow as he was rolled onto his side, his face smothered in less passionate but no less loving licks and kisses.",
      "Philip lay with his arm possessively slung across the broad expanse of chest, his fingers toying with the hardened peak of a nipple.",
      "Soft words of love were whispered into his ear as he drifted off, still wrapped in that firm embrace, his body and mind finally at peace, knowing he was where he belonged - safe and warm in his beloved's arms... forever.",

    "text": "It was a fair walk down a dusty track to where he had left his rented car the previous day; he had deliberately concealed it, not wanting to advertise his presence at the mansion. The early afternoon sun beat down upon him mercilessly and yet he did not feel its sting. Still, it was a relief to clamber inside even though the upholstery was hot to the touch. Philip gunned the engine and then gave thanks to whatever god might be listening, for air conditioning. He was tempted to drive down to the small village that was barely five miles from the mansion but he feared his reception. He was certain he had little to do with the villagers for they were a superstitious lot, and he had memories of them making the sign of the cross whenever he passed by. Somehow, he had the feeling they would be even more hostile should he reappear after his supposed death. He sneered. No doubt they were more than grateful with the turn of events, considering his death to be a blessing in disguise. There was another village that he had once passed through, close to the border with the United States which would make an ideal stopover point for the night. It was a few hours drive, but that would be no hardship for him in an air-conditioned car. Also, stopping there would give him the chance to sit down and plan his next course of action. -ooOOoo- The village was smaller than he remembered, boasting little more than a church, a saloon, a few stores and one seedy looking hotel. He pulled to a halt in the small parking lot and rubbed his hands over tired eyes before alighting. Philip was pleasantly surprised to find his room was far cleaner, and far more comfortable, than he had expected but then he *had* asked for the best room. He was pleased to note that he would not have to share the toilet facilities with the other patrons as the room contained its own private bathroom. It meant he could hide away here and not have to concern himself with the other guests. An hour later he was tempted to go down to the saloon rather than allow the past to catch up with him once more. However, the thought of attracting company was not so exciting a prospect tonight. Instead, he lay down on the bed, hands tucked behind his head, and thought back to the strange encounter that morning. He sighed as he remembered those strong, coarse hands gliding across his body, effortlessly turning him before that thick cock had plunged into him. He could still feel an ache deep inside from where the man had pounded into him in passionate abandonment, and he could remember his own cries of pleasure as he was brought to the brink of annihilation. What seemed so strange to him now, in hindsight, was the fact that not a single word had passed between them. The only sounds uttered were the guttural moans of passion. Of course, it could be that the man spoke no English, still it *was* strange, and yet Philip could not find it within himself to be too concerned. That encounter had eased away some of the terrible memories he had of the white mansion, bringing him a little peace. His eyes traced the thin, spider-like cracks in the plaster above his head. The walls were thin so he could hear the sounds of the other guests moving about; the sound of a toilet flushing, of a closet opening. The drone of a television came from behind his head, filtered through the thin wall separating the rooms, but he ignored its siren call, preferring to retain some sense of peace within his own room. His thoughts gradually led him down the path of half-forgotten memories, but it was not the frightening mistiness of the past seven years that caught up him this time, instead it was the months just prior to his arrival on Delos that called to him. He remembered the bitter tears flowing freely down his girlfriend's face when he said what would be their last goodbye. She had been so angry when he told her his intention to take what money he had and travel the world. She had been stunned at first, having already arranged appointments with countless specialists. She had even been willing to use a little of her own savings if it would buy them a few more months together. Selfish. That is what she had called him. He could still remember the rest of her words as she berated him for planning to desert her. After all I've done for you. You inconsiderate, selfish bastard. Had he been selfish? Was it inconsiderate of him to want to spend the last few months of his *life* making fantastic memories... actually traveling to the exotic places he had only seen before in films and advertisements? He realised that he was still annoyed with her, having long since recognized her true motives for wanting to keep him in Newark - and it had nothing to do with love. She had been looking forward to playing the role of nurse and martyr, all ready and willing to accept the attentions from family and friends alike as they offered her condolences, telling her how brave and saintly she was for giving up everything to make poor Philip's last days more comfortable. He sneered. No doubt she had already picked out her mourning clothes... and wouldn't she have looked so elegant all draped in black. He pictured her in his mind. She had been everything he had ever wanted in a woman; tall, willowy, with ash blond hair falling in waves to her waist. Her large eyes were an icy gray-blue peering out from an elfin face. She had the figure and the face of a supermodel - and, boy, did she know it. Of course, Philip was well aware that there was no real love between them, only great sex. However, he enjoyed having her on his arm for the looks of envy that he would see cross every man's face whenever they walked into a room together. He often wondered what she had got out of the deal and realised that, probably, she had been no different to him. He knew that he was exceptionally good looking, perhaps she enjoyed seeing the jealous looks on the faces of other women. It was obvious that she took pride in her 'catch', her arm always possessively placed about him in company, the arch of her perfectly sculptured eyebrow often raised in arrogant contempt for others. At first it seemed strange to Philip that the serpent god had not considered bringing her to Mexico. Its unhealthy desires had, most certainly, been aroused by his memories of Mary and yet it had made no attempt even to contact her. Perhaps it knew, as he did, that Mary was too strong-minded an individual to fall into the predatory trap that had ensnared all its other victims. All she could bring either of them was grief. He had come full circle in his thoughts once more and had arrived back at the question that had haunted him since Delos. Who, or what, was the serpent god? Why did it choose him? And why did it give him a false name? Another name crossed his mind; Monica. The given name came to mind but, unfortunately, no surname came with it. However, he *could* picture her with her short, dark hair and lithe body. He tried to push passed the veil of mist that still separated him from those hazy memories, focusing on the woman who had been his right-hand. She was pretty and slim... and he seemed to recall that she had an insatiable sexual appetite that was equaled only by the serpent god himself. Her preference had also coincided with the creature inhabiting him, and he remembered how she had taken her greatest pleasure writhing on the bed with another woman while he looked on. His mind supplied images of her coupling with Kelly, their soft flesh entwining, Monica's full, red-painted lips suckling on a dusky-pink nipple as her tiny hand cupped the small breast. Then she would turn, slinking down the bed until she was stretched out on top, her pointed tongue dipping between the soft folds to lap up the natural juices and suck on the small sensitive clit. Monica had been a pleasure to watch, bringing an unwilling partner to a slow, soul-destroying climax over and over as the serpent god within him reveled in the fear and sense of debasement emanating from their chosen victim. Often he would join them on the bed, his hands parting the trembling thighs, tongue twisting and turning as it mimicked fucking, while Monica played and teased higher above, often straddling the face of their coerced partner and demanding her own satisfaction. Other images came but these were remote in comparison and he realised that they were scenes from some of the porn videos he had watched avidly before Delos - before his sickness. He felt the bile rise in his throat as he remembered how enraptured he had been with his collection, how he would masturbate to the images on the television screen... how it had all been corrupted into something sordid and unwholesome by the serpent god. He wondered if he would ever be able to look at another naked woman and not feel nauseated by those horrific memories. Quickly, he turned his thoughts away, focusing instead on Monica, his link to the past seven years. She was a porn star. Yes... it was coming back to him now. Monica had been one of those objects of lust in his porn collection and it, the serpent god, had enticed her to come and play in Mexico. He still had no surname for her, but he had a feeling that she would have returned to Los Angeles, and the porn industry so prevalent there. At the very least, it gave him a starting place. -ooOOoo- The morning came all too soon and, although he had fallen into a dreamless sleep, he did not feel well rested. Philip placed his few belongings into the trunk of his car then paused. It made sense to pick up a few provisions for the drive ahead, just in case there was some delay. Across the dusty road he spied a small grocery store and headed towards it, ignoring the stares of the denizens of the village as they watched his progress with keen, inquisitive eyes. He picked up bottled water, candy and sealed, ready-filled tortillas, paid for the goods and carried the small brown bag from the store. She was so frail and bent double with age, and he missed seeing her as he stalked from the store intent on starting his journey back into the States. The bag dropped from his arms and the contents of her own small bag spilled across the paving. \"I'm so sorry.\" Philip sank to his haunches and, quickly, he packed her meager goods back into the little holdall. He looked up, offering the old lady her bag, his gaze meeting her milky-colored, unseeing eyes. Something deep inside of him felt sorry for her and, without knowing why, he found himself reaching out to touch the paper-thin skin of her liver-spotted arm. Philip fell back in stunned amazement as the cataracts started to dissolve, falling away to reveal brown eyes flecked with gold. Those eyes were widening in shock, tears brimming and falling down the seamed cheeks in realization as she slowly stood up straighter, her clear eyes locking onto his own as her previously darkened world was filled with colors. Words fell from her lips in a language he did not understand, but the tone was of pure wonder. She reached out and clasped his hand as he struggled back to his feet, her tone one of profound joy and gratitude. Philip tried to pull away from her tight grip, his eyes darting around at the crowd that was quickly gathering as her cries reached out to all who would listen. Hands started to reach for him, touching his arms, his body, his hair... his face, and in a sudden panic Philip pulled free. He pushed his way through the crowd, running hard as the sound of voices rising in awe followed him across the street to the parking lot. He slammed the car into reverse as the crowd reached him, terrified by their hands reaching for the car bonnet and grabbing at the door handles. He hurtled backwards down the alleyway, oblivious to the screaming sound of metal sliding against brick, and the crunch of garbage under the wheels. The car burst clear of the alleyway and he spun the wheel then slammed the car into drive. A glance sideways showed the crowd was racing towards him, their faces alive with wonder, hands stretched out towards him. The stench of burning rubber filled the interior as the wheels tried to find purchase on the dusty back road, but then something caught and he was in motion, speeding out towards the main road... and America. He drove hard and without respite for miles before he dared to slow, his heart still thumping in his chest from fear. As his heart rate slowed, so did the car, until they were traveling at an acceptable speed, one that would not attract the attention of the local police. As he continued on his drive Philip steadfastly refused to dwell on what had happened back at the village. He knew he would have to think about it sooner or later, that he would have to try and make some sense out of what had happened. But not right now. An hour passed and, with another glance in the rear-view mirror to convince himself that he was not being followed, Philip pulled over to the edge of the highway. He sank forward, pillowing his forehead on the soft leather of the steering wheel, hands still gripping it so hard his knuckles were white. He forced himself to relax, forced his hands to loosen their death grip, then he looked at the passenger seat for some bottled water - and groaned. In all the panic he had left the water and food on the ground outside the store. \"Fuck.... Fuckfuckfuckfuck*fuck*.\" Philip stormed out of the car, too agitated to even notice the heat that slammed into him. He dragged his hands through sweat-slicked hair and screwed his eyes tightly shut, neck arched back so his upturned face felt the full impact of the hot sun upon it. The sound of a car pulling up on the opposite side of the highway brought him back. \"Are you okay, senor?\" Philip glanced across at the Hispanic driver, seeing genuine concern in the dark eyes. \"I'm fine... just taking a break.\" The man nodded, his eyes sweeping the length of Philip's body in obvious approval of what he saw. \"Well, I passed a small gasoline station three or four miles back. Had a small diner attached... and a motel, if you're interested.\" Philip found his eyes narrowing as the man made it obvious that he was more than willing to turn around and follow Philip back to that motel. \"I'm in a hurry... so I'll just be stopping to eat.\" The man pursed his lips in disappointment and Philip could see him eyeing up his chances of taking what he wanted here and now on this isolated stretch of highway. Philip gave him no opportunity. He bade the man a safe journey and climbed back into the rental, quickly gunning the engine, getting underway before the other man could figure out a way to detain him any longer. As he drove along, Philip realised it was not the man's looks that had turned him off. In fact, the man had been handsome in a rugged kind of way, with dark intelligent eyes and olive skin, and although he had a body that was on the verge of turning to flab, it was still firm enough to attract attention. No, it was not his looks but something far deeper. It was just a feeling that he did not belong with that man. -ooOOoo- The diner was exactly where the man had said it would be and Philip, sipping a coffee, felt his fears slowly dissipating as the minutes passed with no sign of the other driver. The caffeine hit his system, bringing him back to a greater awareness of the world around him and, by the time he had finished eating, he felt more in control of himself, allowing his thoughts to drift back to the elderly woman. There was no doubt in his mind that *something* had happened between them. He had seen the milky cataracts vanish from her eyes, had watched those dead eyes come to life, focusing on him in awe... and he had seen her frail, stooped figure pull upright. Had he done this? Or was the serpent god still inside him, lying dormant, waiting for the right opportunity to strike him down again? It seemed more imperative than ever that he found the answers to his questions, for how could he best this creature if he did not even know its name? Philip pulled out the book of Greek Mythology and turned back to the entry for Asclepius, hoping it might give him some clue. --- Hades, the god of the underworld, was jealously possessive of his subjects and was incensed that they could be snatched from his realm by this lover of mortals. He took his complaints against Asclepius to Zeus, who listened and found them acceptable. Zeus took up a thunderbolt and hurled it, killing Asclepius instantly. In a rage at the loss of his beloved son, Apollo slew all of the Cyclops who labored in the volcano forging thunderbolts for Zeus. Then Apollo pleaded with Zeus to recall Asclepius to life. He pleaded with such eloquence that Zeus relented and, in return, Asclepius brought back the Cyclops so that they could continue forging their thunderbolts. --- It seemed ludicrous to be trying to find a villain out of this book and yet everything that had happened to him seemed bound, somehow, to these old myths. If this particular myth were true, if the gods had - did - exist, then Hades had a grievance against Asclepius. He had asked for justice and had been thwarted by Apollo... and everything he had ever read told him that Hades was a resentful being. Could Hades be trying to sully the name of Asclepius? He checked the entry for Hades in the book but found very little information beyond what he already knew. He sighed deeply. He could read this book from cover to cover and still not find the answers he sought. His one hope was that the serpent god had confided in Monica. Philip paid for his meal, bought a few extra items and returned to his car. A full stomach, and the knowledge that the border was barely an hour's drive away, gave him the enthusiasm he needed to continue on with his journey. -ooOOoo- Although money was not a great problem any more, not since learning of the Swiss bank account, Philip kept his outlay to a bare minimum - without compromising on his safety. He found a small but comfortable hotel in Los Angeles, one used by the tourist trade due to its closeness to Disneyland and other attractions. What he had to figure out next was how to find Monica in this heaving mass of humanity. One option, distasteful as it seemed, did come to him and he made his way down to the nearest video store. His memory of the time before Delos was strong and clear so it did not take him long to track down several titles that had dwelt in his former porn collection. His finger stroked over the face of one of the women gracing the cover of the box - Monica. Unfortunately, there was little else on the box to help him so he was forced to purchase the film in the hope that there might be credits at the beginning or end that might lead him to Monica - or to someone who knew where she might be. Back at the hotel room he loaded the tape into a rented VCR and sat back to watch, remote control held tightly in his hand. -ooOOoo- Armed with the name and address of the studio that had produced the porn film, Philip made his way across Los Angeles. He paused outside a very plain, innocuous looking building and rechecked the address. With a shrug, Philip entered, his eyes widening at the tasteless opulence within. Plush black and white carpets in an elaborate zebra style stretched from wall to wall, the walls were lined with artwork of a very dubious nature being neither erotic nor pornographic, and yet they only seemed to add to the general tackiness of the place. A woman in overdone make-up, with long, scarlet fingernails, glanced up from a desktop PC, her bored expression quickly changing to interest. Her eyes raked across his body, settling on his groin for one long moment before gliding back up to his face. She smiled, lasciviously. \"How may I help you?\" \"I'm looking for...\" He was interrupted by the door opening behind the receptionist. A man in his early fifties, with balding, gray hair stepped out, his piercing blue eyes fixed upon Philip. He approached slowly, gradually circling Philip with the eagerness of a cat cornering a very tasty mouse. The man moved closer until he was standing directly in front of Philip. Philip gasped, eyes widening in shock as he felt the man's hand cover his groin. \"Please tell me you're looking for work.\" Philip took a step back, feeling his cheeks burn with embarrassment. \"No, I'm...\" \"Come now. I can make you famous - and rich. With a body and face like...\" \"No.\" Philip cleared his throat. \"No. I'm not looking for work. I'm looking for Monica.\" \"Monica?\" Philip pulled out the video cassette box and showed the picture of Monica to the man. He watched as the man's eyed narrowed in speculation. \"What's it worth to you? Finding Monica.\" \"What's your price?\" The man pursed his lips, his beady eyes flicking up and down Philip's body in appreciation. \"A few photos, maybe a little film.\" Philip swallowed hard, feeling a sense of helplessness, and he realised, for the first time, how it felt to be on the receiving end of another's sordid intent. Up until now he had felt sorry for girls like Kelly and Rebecca, but he had not been able to identify with the true horror of their position. He found himself in a quandary. He needed to find Monica, but was that information worth seeing himself degraded, his naked body flaunted to satisfy the sexual appetites of strangers? Then he remembered that he had once *been* one of those strangers, all hot and heavy, masturbating to the images of naked men and women playing out their fake orgasms in their contrived fantasies. Philip backed away, his sense of self-worth plummeting in remembrance of what he used to be. He turned and started to walk away. \"Wait!\" The man caught his arm. \"Look, you can't blame a man for trying. You're a good looking kid.\" He gave Philip a friendly smile but the eyes remained cold and calculating. \"Ike Stephens is holding a party tonight. Anybody who's anybody in this side of the industry will be there. There's more than a good chance that this Monica will be there too.\" The sleazy photographer scribbled an address onto the back of a business card and held it out, his smile broadening when Philip took it from him. \"At the door, just tell them you're with John Franks.\" Philip nodded, wondering why the fine hairs on the nape of his neck had risen. He left the tacky office without glancing back. -ooOOoo- Philip paced around his hotel room for hours while he considered what to do. The business card was propped up on top of the cabinet, beckoning to him. \"Dammit.\" He reached forward and snatched it up, shoving into the back pocket of his jeans. Philip shrugged into his jacket and made his way down to the hotel's lobby. Five minutes later he was seated in the back of a cab heading for the scribbled address. -ooOOoo- The house was very plush with cream carpets and furnishings, and the walls held modern prints that gave a splash of colour to the otherwise bland rooms. Philip was unsurprised that the majority of women present wore dresses that left little - or nothing in some cases - to the imagination, their large cleavages spilling out over the top of skimpy pieces of sparkling cloth. In contrast, the men fell into two categories. The first group were probably the directors and producers, flaunting their air of superiority as they caressed anyone who came in contact with them. The other males paraded about as if they were still performing in one of those poorly plotted excuses for a movie. What did surprise Philip was that these male porn stars were fondled just as freely by those executives. Philip tensed as a hand trailed over his hip then lower to cup one ass cheek. \"I don't believe we have met. My name is Ike. Can I get you a drink?\" \"Ike Stephens?\" The man smiled but it was not that kind of welcoming smile that gave Philip any comfort. There was something very sordid behind those pale blue eyes, a feeling of being slowly undressed and feasted upon. There was also a slyness, a calculating look, as the man turned away searching the room for a tray of drinks. Philip's suspicions increased when the man ignored the most convenient tray-bearer, instead, making signs to another man who responded with a sly grin of his own. Philip was handed a crystal flute filled to the brim with champagne. \"A toast... to new friends.\" The man eyed him over the rim of his own glass as Philip was forced, through etiquette, to take a sip. He only hoped that the man was only intent on getting him pleasantly drunk rather than drugging him, having heard enough about certain 'date' drugs that could free the inhibitions leaving the victim open to suggestion - any suggestion. \"I'm looking for Monica. Will she be here..?\" \"Philip?\" He turned swiftly, a smile of relief falling from his lips as he saw her move towards him. She was as beautiful as he remembered her to be, and yet he no longer felt anything for her. As she made her way through the crowd towards him he recalled all the terrible things they had done together. \"Monica.\" \"I thought you were dead.\" She shook her head, still stunned by his reappearance in her life. \"They *said* you were dead, an accident. That you fell and hit your head.\" Her eyes narrowed in appreciation, her mouth pursing beautifully. \"It seems death becomes you, Philip. I must say you look... different, younger... exactly as I remember you on our very first meeting. You must let me in on your secret.\" \"Monica? Perhaps you could introduce me to your... friend.\" \"Oh, Ike. This is Philip. Philip Padgett.\" \"*The* Philip Padgett. You never told me he was such a prize catch. I hope you will stick around for the floor show later, Mr Padgett. I believe the entertainment will be to your liking.\" \"Yes. I'm sure it will be. Now, if you wouldn't mind excusing me... I need to talk to Monica - in private.\" Although the lascivious look was still there, Philip noticed how Stephens attitude had changed towards him when his name was revealed. Philip had ceased to be merely a piece of tasty flesh, now, he had a higher status in that man's eyes. For a moment he wondered what Monica had said to the man about him. Perhaps she had told him all about Mexico - and the sexual appetite of his possessed body. It was apparent that Ike knew something of his 'likes'. Philip put all thoughts of Ike Stephens and the other party-goers out of his mind and turned his attention to Monica. \"Is there somewhere private we could talk?\" \"Sure.\" She licked her lips. \"It's a warm night and there is a lovely little gazebo part way through the grounds.\" Monica linked her arm around his and gave him a knowing smile that he had no clue how to decipher. However, the important thing was, she was here and she was willing to talk to him. \"Lead on.\" The garden was lit at intervals by old fashioned, pseudo-street lights, casting a golden yellow glow that pushed the shadows back. Ahead he could see the gazebo; a small, elegant feature. The sweet perfume of honeysuckle filled the night air, mixed with the heady scent of roses. Philip waited until Monica had made herself comfortable and then he sat down opposite. They talked of inconsequential things at first but, eventually, the conversation steered its way around to their joint past. \"Please tell me that you plan to reopen the sanatorium.\" \"No. But what I need to ask you is connected to that place.\" He paused, unsure where to begin. Something she said came back to him, that he had hit his head when he fell, and he decided to use it as a starting point. \"I lost some of my memory, because of the accident. I need you to fill in some of the gaps.\" Monica's eyes widened in interest - and speculation. She pursed her lips. \"How much is your memory worth?\" He had a nasty sense of deja vu, remembering the creep who had given him the invitation to this party, but this time he knew what was wanted - and it had nothing to do with his body. \"Two hundred.\" \"Five.\" \"Three - and then only if the information is good.\" Monica licked her lips, her eyes still holding a calculating look but then she sighed. \"What do you need to know?\" \"Did I ever talk about myself? Where the healing power came from? Did I ever use another name?\" \"Asclepius... and on one or two occasions, Podilarius.\" --- Podilarius, son of Asclepius and master of diagnosing and curing disease. He and his brother, Machaon, the great surgeon, went to Troy where their skill allowed thousands of the wounded to survive. Towards the end of the war, Machaon was killed by an arrow shot from the bow of Penthesilea, Amazon princess and daughter of Ares, who was fighting on the side of the Trojans. Of Podilarius, there is no further reference except that he grieved heavily for his beloved brother, begging his ancestors for their intercession, but gaining no response. --- \"That's all you ever said, Philip.\" \"Nothing else? No explanations of where the serpent came from? No reasons for my actions? No boasts or brags?\" She shook her head slowly, then paused, a frown deepening the fine lines on her forehead. \"You once mentioned seeking vengeance for your grandmother - and for her family. I remember it was just after you...\" \"There you are! The floor show's already started... and I am certain you don't want to miss it.\" Startled, Philip looked as Ike Stephens appeared out of nowhere. He felt his arm being taken but decided against making a scene, allowing himself to be guided back to the house. He could hear Monica following on behind, her light footfall crunching softly upon the gravel path. -ooOOoo- Philip's eyes widened in shock at the sight before him. There was nothing remaining of the semi-formal party he had left but twenty minutes earlier. The room had been darkened but the strobing white, red and blue light left little to the imagination as naked bodies writhed and twisted in a single mass that seemed to move in time to the heavy, thumping beat of music playing at a deafening volume. It was impossible to tell where one person began and another ended. He turned to Monica, questioningly, only to find she was already half naked. She wriggled and her blue sequin dress slid over her hips, dropping the rest of the way to her feet, leaving her clad only in stockings and suspenders. Quickly, she disappeared as hands drew her down, willingly, into the press of heaving bodies. A hand snaked around his own body, tugging the T-shirt from his jeans. He pushed it away but more hands joined in, pulling at his pants and shirt. He felt the T-shirt rip, felt himself topple as he was dragged down. His shoes and socks were stripped from his feet, someone was undoing his fly and he struggled as those hands began to pull the denim over his hips. Other hands were grabbing at him, pinching his nipples, fondling his ass and his genitals. Fingers clawed at his hair, dragging his face first one way then another as mouths, both male and female, sucked and licked and kissed a path across his throat and cheeks. A mouth latched onto his and he felt a sting as teeth raked across his lower lip, drawing blood. Panic gripped at him as he was swallowed by the undulating mass of bodies. He tried to kick out at the weight pinning him to the floor. He gasped when he saw, then felt, a woman bury her face into his groin, his whole body tensing in revulsion as her bright red lips encircled his flaccid cock, her hair falling like a curtain around her face. Somehow, he managed to buck his hips and dislodge her but another took her place. This time it was a man who raised his eyes to meet Philip's - and Philip found himself looking down, in horror, at Ike Stephen's lust-crazed eyes. No amount of twisting could remove the hands and legs that pinned him beneath the writhing bodies. Then, suddenly, he felt himself being dragged out from under the others - and then he was free. A blanket fell over his shoulders, and he pulled it tight around himself as he was guided through the throng of naked bodies and out of the house. Philip took a deep, ragged breath as he left the chaos behind, breathing in the clear night air. Strong arms grabbed him as his knees buckled in delayed shock, and he felt himself being raised until he was cradled in those arms. \"My clothes!\" The man shook his head and sighed, and Philip realised that it was not worth trying to find them, grateful that his earlier feelings of unease had made him leave everything of any importance back at the hotel. Despite the sudden embarrassment when he realised that he was being carried like a baby, Philip felt a strange reluctance to be released from this man's arms. All too soon he felt those arms letting go, then found himself being aided into a dark sedan. Philip stared out of the passenger window as the lights of the city went racing past in a rush of rainbow bright neon. The car pulled to a halt and Philip blinked in confusion when he realised he had been taken back to his hotel. For the first time, he looked across at his savior and found large green eyes, so similar to his own, gazing back at him from a handsome, unfamiliar face. Tousled blond hair flopped across the tall forehead adding a touch of boyishness to the more mature features. The man reached out towards him, his finger touching Philip's torn lip, lightly but Philip felt no pain, just a tingling sensation that swept from his lips to burn, like liquid fire, through his body. At this time of night the hotel lobby was fairly deserted, even so there were a few staff and guests milling about, and yet no one so much as glanced in their direction as they moved across to the elevator. In his state of undress, wrapped only in a blanket, Philip had expected to be gawked at. Philip never questioned the blond's entrance into his hotel room and, even if he had any thought of polite hospitality, it was given no opportunity to present itself. As soon as the door closed behind them, Philip found himself being taken back into those arms. He threw back his head as soft, firm lips sucked and kissed at his vulnerable throat, the blanket falling unheeded to the floor as the mouth latched onto the sensitive sunburst tattoo. Philip heard someone groaning in pleasure and, with a shock, realised it was himself. His will seemed to dissolve as the man bent him backwards, that knowing mouth traveling down his torso, tongue swiping across one hardened peak of a nipple. He was falling, in slow motion, but the bed seemed to come up to meet him, cushioning his body as he floated down to the soft mattress. His lover followed him down, covering him with urgent kisses, the long fingers stroking Philip's overheated flesh. Philip's hands reached out, fingers carding through the tousled hair as the man moved down his body until he was poised between Philip's parted thighs. Philip's memory returned to the sight of that woman with her scarlet lipstick coated mouth burying herself in his groin, she morphed into Ike Stephens with his lecherous eyes and obscenely thick tongue, but the revulsion was swept away by the beauty of this new moment. Luscious, full lips, darkened in the heat of passion, bestowed a soft kiss on the tip of his straining erection before parting to take in the head. Philip gripped the blond hair tighter, a groan falling from his own lips as the man's tongue twisted and rubbed against the sensitive glans sending spikes of energy flowing through his nerve endings. Philip arched up, accepting the saliva-slicked finger that stroked and begged admittance to his body. He cried out for more as he was slowly driven to the edge of madness between the teasing finger, which had found the incredibly sensitive spot deep inside, and the gently sucking mouth. With a desperate cry he fell over the edge into oblivion but found himself floating back to earth in the arms of his lover, his head was pillowed on the lightly sweating chest, the soft repetitive murmur of a strong heart so comforting as all the fear from this night was driven away. Philip felt a moment of anxiety when he realised his lover had not been satisfied. It was a new feeling for him, having never been too concerned in the past whether his bed partner had gained as much satisfaction as himself. He tried to pull out of the arms that held him so securely, wanting to give this man as much pleasure as he had felt. \"Let me...\" \"Sshh.\" The man held him fast and Philip relaxed. He was so tired, he felt so drained. His eyes closed as body, mind and soul fell under the enchanting spell woven by that strong heartbeat - and he slept in that comforting embrace. -ooOOoo- When he awoke, the light of a new day was seeping around the edges of the curtain - and his lover, his savior, of the night before had gone as if he had been part of a beautiful dream. His body still felt the warm touch of another body, as if the man had left but a moment before his eyes had opened. Philip sighed and pulled himself up to sit with his back against the headboard. A jumble of images from last evening flowed through his mind but he focused on only one; Monica. Her final words floated back to him. \"You once mentioned seeking vengeance for your grandmother - and for her family.\" Philip reached into the beside drawer and pulled out the book of mythology. --- Apollo forced his attentions upon the maiden Coronis but when pregnant with their son, Asclepius, she rebelled and returned to her first love. Artemis, twin sister to Apollo, who was ever watchful of her brother's honor, was enraged. She slew the rebellious girl with silver arrow. Asclepius was born during her death throes, watching the details of his own birth with profound attention. Her father, Phlegyas, a king of Lapiths, was so enraged at the death of his beloved daughter that he attacked Apollo's temple at Delphi - and destroyed it. For this crime he was killed by Apollo and condemned to spend eternity bound hand and foot in perpetual fear of being crushed by a large rock suspended in mid air above him by an invisible thread. --- Philip stared at the text. It was all so confusing. Certainly, Podilarius had reason to want to take revenge; for the death of his brother, for the death of his grandmother, for the eternal damnation of his great-grandfather... but Podilarius was not a god despite the divinity of his grandfather, Apollo. He had great powers of diagnosis and healing but he was still just a man - and certainly not a serpent. And, even if it was him, who was he trying to take revenge upon? Asclepius, who had the power to bring his own son, Machaon, back to life but did not? Or Apollo, who had caused such misery in his grandmother's family? There was one more question. Why had he, Philip Paget, been chosen as the instrument of this revenge? Philip let the book fall into his lap and he buried his head in his hands. There were other unanswered questions; questions that had formed since his 'rebirth'. Why had he been given this power of healing? And who were the men who came to him - and loved him? His thoughts returned to the blond stranger who had appeared out of nowhere to rescue him from the writhing mass of lust-driven bodies at the party. The man had not spoken to him, except to hush him like a mother with a small child, and he had left without a word giving Philip no opportunity to thank him. That small sense of selfishness reared itself as he remembered doing nothing to give that man any pleasure in return. It was another new feeling that was clambering the walls of what had once been a stone-cold heart. Selflessness and compassion were melting the void in his soul and, with sudden insight, Philip knew what he had to do next was appease those new feelings. It was far too late for Kelly but, just maybe, he could use this new power to give back to the others what they had paid dearly for, and what had been cruelly snatched away by the serpent god's evil - true healing. Something deep inside told him that the answers to his questions lay along that path. THE END... for now. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ UPDATED: 27th September 2000",

      "He sneered.",
      "No doubt she had already picked out her mourning clothes... and wouldn't she have looked so elegant all draped in black.",

      "He tried to push passed the veil of mist that still separated him from those hazy memories, focusing on the woman who had been his right-hand.",
      "She was pretty and slim... and he seemed to recall that she had an insatiable sexual appetite that was equaled only by the serpent god himself.",
      "Her preference had also coincided with the creature inhabiting him, and he remembered how she had taken her greatest pleasure writhing on the bed with another woman while he looked on.",
      "His mind supplied images of her coupling with Kelly, their soft flesh entwining, Monica's full, red-painted lips suckling on a dusky-pink nipple as her tiny hand cupped the small breast.",
      "Then she would turn, slinking down the bed until she was stretched out on top, her pointed tongue dipping between the soft folds to lap up the natural juices and suck on the small sensitive clit.",
      "Monica had been a pleasure to watch, bringing an unwilling partner to a slow, soul-destroying climax over and over as the serpent god within him reveled in the fear and sense of debasement emanating from their chosen victim.",
      "Often he would join them on the bed, his hands parting the trembling thighs, tongue twisting and turning as it mimicked fucking, while Monica played and teased higher above, often straddling the face of their coerced partner and demanding her own satisfaction.",
      "Other images came but these were remote in comparison and he realised that they were scenes from some of the porn videos he had watched avidly before Delos - before his sickness.",
      "He felt the bile rise in his throat as he remembered how enraptured he had been with his collection, how he would masturbate to the images on the television screen...",
      "how it had all been corrupted into something sordid and unwholesome by the serpent god.",
      "He wondered if he would ever be able to look at another naked woman and not feel nauseated by those horrific memories.",
      "Quickly, he turned his thoughts away, focusing instead on Monica, his link to the past seven years.",
      "She was a porn star.",
      "Yes... it was coming back to him now.",
      "Monica had been one of those objects of lust in his porn collection and it, the serpent god, had enticed her to come and play in Mexico.",
      "He still had no surname for her, but he had a feeling that she would have returned to Los Angeles, and the porn industry so prevalent there.",
      "At the very least, it gave him a starting place.",
      "-ooOOoo- The morning came all too soon and, although he had fallen into a dreamless sleep, he did not feel well rested.",
      "Philip placed his few belongings into the trunk of his car then paused.",
      "It made sense to pick up a few provisions for the drive ahead, just in case there was some delay.",
      "Across the dusty road he spied a small grocery store and headed towards it, ignoring the stares of the denizens of the village as they watched his progress with keen, inquisitive eyes.",
      "He picked up bottled water, candy and sealed, ready-filled tortillas, paid for the goods and carried the small brown bag from the store.",
      "She was so frail and bent double with age, and he missed seeing her as he stalked from the store intent on starting his journey back into the States.",
      "The bag dropped from his arms and the contents of her own small bag spilled across the paving.",
      "\"I'm so sorry.\"",
      "Philip sank to his haunches and, quickly, he packed her meager goods back into the little holdall.",
      "He looked up, offering the old lady her bag, his gaze meeting her milky-colored, unseeing eyes.",
      "Something deep inside of him felt sorry for her and, without knowing why, he found himself reaching out to touch the paper-thin skin of her liver-spotted arm.",
      "Philip fell back in stunned amazement as the cataracts started to dissolve, falling away to reveal brown eyes flecked with gold.",
      "Those eyes were widening in shock, tears brimming and falling down the seamed cheeks in realization as she slowly stood up straighter, her clear eyes locking onto his own as her previously darkened world was filled with colors.",
      "Words fell from her lips in a language he did not understand, but the tone was of pure wonder.",
      "She reached out and clasped his hand as he struggled back to his feet, her tone one of profound joy and gratitude.",
      "Philip tried to pull away from her tight grip, his eyes darting around at the crowd that was quickly gathering as her cries reached out to all who would listen.",
      "Hands started to reach for him, touching his arms, his body, his hair... his face, and in a sudden panic Philip pulled free.",
      "He pushed his way through the crowd, running hard as the sound of voices rising in awe followed him across the street to the parking lot.",
      "He slammed the car into reverse as the crowd reached him, terrified by their hands reaching for the car bonnet and grabbing at the door handles.",
      "He hurtled backwards down the alleyway, oblivious to the screaming sound of metal sliding against brick, and the crunch of garbage under the wheels.",
      "The car burst clear of the alleyway and he spun the wheel then slammed the car into drive.",
      "A glance sideways showed the crowd was racing towards him, their faces alive with wonder, hands stretched out towards him.",
      "The stench of burning rubber filled the interior as the wheels tried to find purchase on the dusty back road, but then something caught and he was in motion, speeding out towards the main road... and America.",
      "He drove hard and without respite for miles before he dared to slow, his heart still thumping in his chest from fear.",
      "As his heart rate slowed, so did the car, until they were traveling at an acceptable speed, one that would not attract the attention of the local police.",
      "As he continued on his drive Philip steadfastly refused to dwell on what had happened back at the village.",
      "He knew he would have to think about it sooner or later, that he would have to try and make some sense out of what had happened.",
      "But not right now.",
      "An hour passed and, with another glance in the rear-view mirror to convince himself that he was not being followed, Philip pulled over to the edge of the highway.",
      "He sank forward, pillowing his forehead on the soft leather of the steering wheel, hands still gripping it so hard his knuckles were white.",
      "He forced himself to relax, forced his hands to loosen their death grip, then he looked at the passenger seat for some bottled water - and groaned.",
      "In all the panic he had left the water and food on the ground outside the store.",
      "\"Fuck.... Fuckfuckfuckfuck*fuck*.\"",
      "Philip stormed out of the car, too agitated to even notice the heat that slammed into him.",
      "He dragged his hands through sweat-slicked hair and screwed his eyes tightly shut, neck arched back so his upturned face felt the full impact of the hot sun upon it.",
      "The sound of a car pulling up on the opposite side of the highway brought him back.",
      "\"Are you okay, senor?\" Philip glanced across at the Hispanic driver, seeing genuine concern in the dark eyes.",
      "\"I'm fine... just taking a break.\"",
      "The man nodded, his eyes sweeping the length of Philip's body in obvious approval of what he saw.",
      "\"Well, I passed a small gasoline station three or four miles back.",
      "Had a small diner attached... and a motel, if you're interested.\"",
      "Philip found his eyes narrowing as the man made it obvious that he was more than willing to turn around and follow Philip back to that motel.",
      "\"I'm in a hurry...",
      "so I'll just be stopping to eat.\"",
      "The man pursed his lips in disappointment and Philip could see him eyeing up his chances of taking what he wanted here and now on this isolated stretch of highway.",
      "Philip gave him no opportunity.",
      "He bade the man a safe journey and climbed back into the rental, quickly gunning the engine, getting underway before the other man could figure out a way to detain him any longer.",
      "As he drove along, Philip realised it was not the man's looks that had turned him off.",
      "In fact, the man had been handsome in a rugged kind of way, with dark intelligent eyes and olive skin, and although he had a body that was on the verge of turning to flab, it was still firm enough to attract attention.",
      "No, it was not his looks but something far deeper.",
      "It was just a feeling that he did not belong with that man.",
      "-ooOOoo- The diner was exactly where the man had said it would be and Philip, sipping a coffee, felt his fears slowly dissipating as the minutes passed with no sign of the other driver.",
      "The caffeine hit his system, bringing him back to a greater awareness of the world around him and, by the time he had finished eating, he felt more in control of himself, allowing his thoughts to drift back to the elderly woman.",
      "There was no doubt in his mind that *something* had happened between them.",
      "He had seen the milky cataracts vanish from her eyes, had watched those dead eyes come to life, focusing on him in awe... and he had seen her frail, stooped figure pull upright.",
      "Had he done this?",
      "Or was the serpent god still inside him, lying dormant, waiting for the right opportunity to strike him down again?",
      "It seemed more imperative than ever that he found the answers to his questions, for how could he best this creature if he did not even know its name?",
      "Philip pulled out the book of Greek Mythology and turned back to the entry for Asclepius, hoping it might give him some clue.",
      "--- Hades, the god of the underworld, was jealously possessive of his subjects and was incensed that they could be snatched from his realm by this lover of mortals.",
      "He took his complaints against Asclepius to Zeus, who listened and found them acceptable.",
      "Zeus took up a thunderbolt and hurled it, killing Asclepius instantly.",
      "In a rage at the loss of his beloved son, Apollo slew all of the Cyclops who labored in the volcano forging thunderbolts for Zeus.",
      "Then Apollo pleaded with Zeus to recall Asclepius to life.",
      "He pleaded with such eloquence that Zeus relented and, in return, Asclepius brought back the Cyclops so that they could continue forging their thunderbolts.",
      "--- It seemed ludicrous to be trying to find a villain out of this book and yet everything that had happened to him seemed bound, somehow, to these old myths.",
      "If this particular myth were true, if the gods had - did - exist, then Hades had a grievance against Asclepius.",
      "He had asked for justice and had been thwarted by Apollo... and everything he had ever read told him that Hades was a resentful being.",
      "Could Hades be trying to sully the name of Asclepius?",
      "He checked the entry for Hades in the book but found very little information beyond what he already knew.",
      "He sighed deeply.",
      "He could read this book from cover to cover and still not find the answers he sought.",
      "His one hope was that the serpent god had confided in Monica.",
      "Philip paid for his meal, bought a few extra items and returned to his car.",
      "A full stomach, and the knowledge that the border was barely an hour's drive away, gave him the enthusiasm he needed to continue on with his journey.",
      "-ooOOoo- Although money was not a great problem any more, not since learning of the Swiss bank account, Philip kept his outlay to a bare minimum - without compromising on his safety.",
      "He found a small but comfortable hotel in Los Angeles, one used by the tourist trade due to its closeness to Disneyland and other attractions.",
      "What he had to figure out next was how to find Monica in this heaving mass of humanity.",
      "One option, distasteful as it seemed, did come to him and he made his way down to the nearest video store.",
      "His memory of the time before Delos was strong and clear so it did not take him long to track down several titles that had dwelt in his former porn collection.",
      "His finger stroked over the face of one of the women gracing the cover of the box - Monica.",
      "Unfortunately, there was little else on the box to help him so he was forced to purchase the film in the hope that there might be credits at the beginning or end that might lead him to Monica - or to someone who knew where she might be.",
      "Back at the hotel room he loaded the tape into a rented VCR and sat back to watch, remote control held tightly in his hand.",
      "-ooOOoo- Armed with the name and address of the studio that had produced the porn film, Philip made his way across Los Angeles.",
      "He paused outside a very plain, innocuous looking building and rechecked the address.",
      "With a shrug, Philip entered, his eyes widening at the tasteless opulence within.",
      "Plush black and white carpets in an elaborate zebra style stretched from wall to wall, the walls were lined with artwork of a very dubious nature being neither erotic nor pornographic, and yet they only seemed to add to the general tackiness of the place.",
      "A woman in overdone make-up, with long, scarlet fingernails, glanced up from a desktop PC, her bored expression quickly changing to interest.",
      "Her eyes raked across his body, settling on his groin for one long moment before gliding back up to his face.",
      "She smiled, lasciviously.",
      "\"How may I help you?\"",
      "\"I'm looking for...\" He was interrupted by the door opening behind the receptionist.",
      "A man in his early fifties, with balding, gray hair stepped out, his piercing blue eyes fixed upon Philip.",
      "He approached slowly, gradually circling Philip with the eagerness of a cat cornering a very tasty mouse.",
      "The man moved closer until he was standing directly in front of Philip.",
      "Philip gasped, eyes widening in shock as he felt the man's hand cover his groin.",
      "\"Please tell me you're looking for work.\"",
      "Philip took a step back, feeling his cheeks burn with embarrassment.",
      "\"No, I'm...\" \"Come now.",
      "I can make you famous - and rich.",
      "With a body and face like...\" \"No.\"",
      "Philip cleared his throat.",
      "\"No. I'm not looking for work.",
      "I'm looking for Monica.\"",
      "\"Monica?\" Philip pulled out the video cassette box and showed the picture of Monica to the man.",
      "He watched as the man's eyed narrowed in speculation.",
      "\"What's it worth to you?",
      "Finding Monica.\"",
      "\"What's your price?\"",
      "The man pursed his lips, his beady eyes flicking up and down Philip's body in appreciation.",
      "\"A few photos, maybe a little film.\"",
      "Philip swallowed hard, feeling a sense of helplessness, and he realised, for the first time, how it felt to be on the receiving end of another's sordid intent.",
      "Up until now he had felt sorry for girls like Kelly and Rebecca, but he had not been able to identify with the true horror of their position.",
      "He found himself in a quandary.",
      "He needed to find Monica, but was that information worth seeing himself degraded, his naked body flaunted to satisfy the sexual appetites of strangers?",
      "Then he remembered that he had once *been* one of those strangers, all hot and heavy, masturbating to the images of naked men and women playing out their fake orgasms in their contrived fantasies.",
      "Philip backed away, his sense of self-worth plummeting in remembrance of what he used to be.",
      "He turned and started to walk away.",
      "\"Wait!\"",
      "The man caught his arm.",
      "\"Look, you can't blame a man for trying.",
      "You're a good looking kid.\"",
      "He gave Philip a friendly smile but the eyes remained cold and calculating.",
      "\"Ike Stephens is holding a party tonight.",
      "Anybody who's anybody in this side of the industry will be there.",
      "There's more than a good chance that this Monica will be there too.\"",
      "The sleazy photographer scribbled an address onto the back of a business card and held it out, his smile broadening when Philip took it from him.",
      "\"At the door, just tell them you're with John Franks.\"",
      "Philip nodded, wondering why the fine hairs on the nape of his neck had risen.",
      "He left the tacky office without glancing back.",
      "-ooOOoo- Philip paced around his hotel room for hours while he considered what to do.",
      "The business card was propped up on top of the cabinet, beckoning to him.",
      "\"Dammit.\"",
      "He reached forward and snatched it up, shoving into the back pocket of his jeans.",
      "Philip shrugged into his jacket and made his way down to the hotel's lobby.",
      "Five minutes later he was seated in the back of a cab heading for the scribbled address.",
      "-ooOOoo- The house was very plush with cream carpets and furnishings, and the walls held modern prints that gave a splash of colour to the otherwise bland rooms.",
      "Philip was unsurprised that the majority of women present wore dresses that left little - or nothing in some cases - to the imagination, their large cleavages spilling out over the top of skimpy pieces of sparkling cloth.",
      "In contrast, the men fell into two categories.",
      "The first group were probably the directors and producers, flaunting their air of superiority as they caressed anyone who came in contact with them.",
      "The other males paraded about as if they were still performing in one of those poorly plotted excuses for a movie.",
      "What did surprise Philip was that these male porn stars were fondled just as freely by those executives.",
      "Philip tensed as a hand trailed over his hip then lower to cup one ass cheek.",
      "\"I don't believe we have met.",
      "My name is Ike.",
      "Can I get you a drink?\"",
      "\"Ike Stephens?\"",
      "The man smiled but it was not that kind of welcoming smile that gave Philip any comfort.",
      "There was something very sordid behind those pale blue eyes, a feeling of being slowly undressed and feasted upon.",
      "There was also a slyness, a calculating look, as the man turned away searching the room for a tray of drinks.",
      "Philip's suspicions increased when the man ignored the most convenient tray-bearer, instead, making signs to another man who responded with a sly grin of his own.",
      "Philip was handed a crystal flute filled to the brim with champagne.",
      "\"A toast... to new friends.\"",
      "The man eyed him over the rim of his own glass as Philip was forced, through etiquette, to take a sip.",
      "He only hoped that the man was only intent on getting him pleasantly drunk rather than drugging him, having heard enough about certain 'date' drugs that could free the inhibitions leaving the victim open to suggestion - any suggestion.",
      "\"I'm looking for Monica.",
      "Will she be here..?\" \"Philip?\"",
      "He turned swiftly, a smile of relief falling from his lips as he saw her move towards him.",
      "She was as beautiful as he remembered her to be, and yet he no longer felt anything for her.",
      "As she made her way through the crowd towards him he recalled all the terrible things they had done together.",
      "\"Monica.\"",
      "\"I thought you were dead.\"",
      "She shook her head, still stunned by his reappearance in her life.",
      "\"They *said* you were dead, an accident.",
      "That you fell and hit your head.\"",
      "Her eyes narrowed in appreciation, her mouth pursing beautifully.",
      "\"It seems death becomes you, Philip.",
      "I must say you look... different, younger...",
      "exactly as I remember you on our very first meeting.",
      "You must let me in on your secret.\"",
      "\"Monica?",
      "Perhaps you could introduce me to your... friend.\"",
      "\"Oh, Ike.",
      "This is Philip.",
      "Philip Padgett.\"",
      "\"*The* Philip Padgett.",
      "You never told me he was such a prize catch.",
      "I hope you will stick around for the floor show later, Mr Padgett.",
      "I believe the entertainment will be to your liking.\"",
      "\"Yes.",
      "I'm sure it will be.",
      "Now, if you wouldn't mind excusing me...",
      "I need to talk to Monica - in private.\"",
      "Although the lascivious look was still there, Philip noticed how Stephens attitude had changed towards him when his name was revealed.",
      "Philip had ceased to be merely a piece of tasty flesh, now, he had a higher status in that man's eyes.",
      "For a moment he wondered what Monica had said to the man about him.",
      "Perhaps she had told him all about Mexico - and the sexual appetite of his possessed body.",
      "It was apparent that Ike knew something of his 'likes'.",
      "Philip put all thoughts of Ike Stephens and the other party-goers out of his mind and turned his attention to Monica.",
      "\"Is there somewhere private we could talk?\"",
      "\"Sure.\"",
      "She licked her lips.",
      "\"It's a warm night and there is a lovely little gazebo part way through the grounds.\"",
      "Monica linked her arm around his and gave him a knowing smile that he had no clue how to decipher.",
      "However, the important thing was, she was here and she was willing to talk to him.",
      "\"Lead on.\"",
      "The garden was lit at intervals by old fashioned, pseudo-street lights, casting a golden yellow glow that pushed the shadows back.",
      "Ahead he could see the gazebo; a small, elegant feature.",
      "The sweet perfume of honeysuckle filled the night air, mixed with the heady scent of roses.",
      "Philip waited until Monica had made herself comfortable and then he sat down opposite.",
      "They talked of inconsequential things at first but, eventually, the conversation steered its way around to their joint past.",
      "\"Please tell me that you plan to reopen the sanatorium.\"",
      "\"No.",
      "But what I need to ask you is connected to that place.\"",
      "He paused, unsure where to begin.",
      "Something she said came back to him, that he had hit his head when he fell, and he decided to use it as a starting point.",
      "\"I lost some of my memory, because of the accident.",
      "I need you to fill in some of the gaps.\"",
      "Monica's eyes widened in interest - and speculation.",
      "She pursed her lips.",
      "\"How much is your memory worth?\"",
      "He had a nasty sense of deja vu, remembering the creep who had given him the invitation to this party, but this time he knew what was wanted - and it had nothing to do with his body.",
      "\"Two hundred.\"",
      "\"Five.\"",
      "\"Three - and then only if the information is good.\"",
      "Monica licked her lips, her eyes still holding a calculating look but then she sighed.",
      "\"What do you need to know?\"",
      "\"Did I ever talk about myself?",
      "Where the healing power came from?",
      "Did I ever use another name?\" \"Asclepius... and on one or two occasions, Podilarius.\"",
      "--- Podilarius, son of Asclepius and master of diagnosing and curing disease.",
      "He and his brother, Machaon, the great surgeon, went to Troy where their skill allowed thousands of the wounded to survive.",
      "Towards the end of the war, Machaon was killed by an arrow shot from the bow of Penthesilea, Amazon princess and daughter of Ares, who was fighting on the side of the Trojans.",
      "Of Podilarius, there is no further reference except that he grieved heavily for his beloved brother, begging his ancestors for their intercession, but gaining no response.",
      "--- \"That's all you ever said, Philip.\"",
      "\"Nothing else?",
      "No explanations of where the serpent came from?",
      "No reasons for my actions?",
      "No boasts or brags?\"",
      "She shook her head slowly, then paused, a frown deepening the fine lines on her forehead.",
      "\"You once mentioned seeking vengeance for your grandmother - and for her family.",
      "I remember it was just after you...\" \"There you are!",
      "The floor show's already started... and I am certain you don't want to miss it.\"",
      "Startled, Philip looked as Ike Stephens appeared out of nowhere.",
      "He felt his arm being taken but decided against making a scene, allowing himself to be guided back to the house.",
      "He could hear Monica following on behind, her light footfall crunching softly upon the gravel path.",
      "-ooOOoo- Philip's eyes widened in shock at the sight before him.",
      "There was nothing remaining of the semi-formal party he had left but twenty minutes earlier.",
      "The room had been darkened but the strobing white, red and blue light left little to the imagination as naked bodies writhed and twisted in a single mass that seemed to move in time to the heavy, thumping beat of music playing at a deafening volume.",
      "It was impossible to tell where one person began and another ended.",
      "He turned to Monica, questioningly, only to find she was already half naked.",
      "She wriggled and her blue sequin dress slid over her hips, dropping the rest of the way to her feet, leaving her clad only in stockings and suspenders.",
      "Quickly, she disappeared as hands drew her down, willingly, into the press of heaving bodies.",
      "A hand snaked around his own body, tugging the T-shirt from his jeans.",
      "He pushed it away but more hands joined in, pulling at his pants and shirt.",
      "He felt the T-shirt rip, felt himself topple as he was dragged down.",
      "His shoes and socks were stripped from his feet, someone was undoing his fly and he struggled as those hands began to pull the denim over his hips.",
      "Other hands were grabbing at him, pinching his nipples, fondling his ass and his genitals.",
      "Fingers clawed at his hair, dragging his face first one way then another as mouths, both male and female, sucked and licked and kissed a path across his throat and cheeks.",
      "A mouth latched onto his and he felt a sting as teeth raked across his lower lip, drawing blood.",
      "Panic gripped at him as he was swallowed by the undulating mass of bodies.",
      "He tried to kick out at the weight pinning him to the floor.",
      "He gasped when he saw, then felt, a woman bury her face into his groin, his whole body tensing in revulsion as her bright red lips encircled his flaccid cock, her hair falling like a curtain around her face.",
      "Somehow, he managed to buck his hips and dislodge her but another took her place.",
      "This time it was a man who raised his eyes to meet Philip's - and Philip found himself looking down, in horror, at Ike Stephen's lust-crazed eyes.",
      "No amount of twisting could remove the hands and legs that pinned him beneath the writhing bodies.",
      "Then, suddenly, he felt himself being dragged out from under the others - and then he was free.",
      "A blanket fell over his shoulders, and he pulled it tight around himself as he was guided through the throng of naked bodies and out of the house.",
      "Philip took a deep, ragged breath as he left the chaos behind, breathing in the clear night air.",
      "Strong arms grabbed him as his knees buckled in delayed shock, and he felt himself being raised until he was cradled in those arms.",
      "\"My clothes!\"",
      "The man shook his head and sighed, and Philip realised that it was not worth trying to find them, grateful that his earlier feelings of unease had made him leave everything of any importance back at the hotel.",
      "Despite the sudden embarrassment when he realised that he was being carried like a baby, Philip felt a strange reluctance to be released from this man's arms.",
      "All too soon he felt those arms letting go, then found himself being aided into a dark sedan.",
      "Philip stared out of the passenger window as the lights of the city went racing past in a rush of rainbow bright neon.",
      "The car pulled to a halt and Philip blinked in confusion when he realised he had been taken back to his hotel.",
      "For the first time, he looked across at his savior and found large green eyes, so similar to his own, gazing back at him from a handsome, unfamiliar face.",
      "Tousled blond hair flopped across the tall forehead adding a touch of boyishness to the more mature features.",
      "The man reached out towards him, his finger touching Philip's torn lip, lightly but Philip felt no pain, just a tingling sensation that swept from his lips to burn, like liquid fire, through his body.",
      "At this time of night the hotel lobby was fairly deserted, even so there were a few staff and guests milling about, and yet no one so much as glanced in their direction as they moved across to the elevator.",
      "In his state of undress, wrapped only in a blanket, Philip had expected to be gawked at.",
      "Philip never questioned the blond's entrance into his hotel room and, even if he had any thought of polite hospitality, it was given no opportunity to present itself.",
      "As soon as the door closed behind them, Philip found himself being taken back into those arms.",
      "He threw back his head as soft, firm lips sucked and kissed at his vulnerable throat, the blanket falling unheeded to the floor as the mouth latched onto the sensitive sunburst tattoo.",
      "Philip heard someone groaning in pleasure and, with a shock, realised it was himself.",
      "His will seemed to dissolve as the man bent him backwards, that knowing mouth traveling down his torso, tongue swiping across one hardened peak of a nipple.",
      "He was falling, in slow motion, but the bed seemed to come up to meet him, cushioning his body as he floated down to the soft mattress.",
      "His lover followed him down, covering him with urgent kisses, the long fingers stroking Philip's overheated flesh.",
      "Philip's hands reached out, fingers carding through the tousled hair as the man moved down his body until he was poised between Philip's parted thighs.",
      "Philip's memory returned to the sight of that woman with her scarlet lipstick coated mouth burying herself in his groin, she morphed into Ike Stephens with his lecherous eyes and obscenely thick tongue, but the revulsion was swept away by the beauty of this new moment.",
      "Luscious, full lips, darkened in the heat of passion, bestowed a soft kiss on the tip of his straining erection before parting to take in the head.",
      "Philip gripped the blond hair tighter, a groan falling from his own lips as the man's tongue twisted and rubbed against the sensitive glans sending spikes of energy flowing through his nerve endings.",
      "Philip arched up, accepting the saliva-slicked finger that stroked and begged admittance to his body.",
      "He cried out for more as he was slowly driven to the edge of madness between the teasing finger, which had found the incredibly sensitive spot deep inside, and the gently sucking mouth.",
      "With a desperate cry he fell over the edge into oblivion but found himself floating back to earth in the arms of his lover, his head was pillowed on the lightly sweating chest, the soft repetitive murmur of a strong heart so comforting as all the fear from this night was driven away.",
      "Philip felt a moment of anxiety when he realised his lover had not been satisfied.",
      "It was a new feeling for him, having never been too concerned in the past whether his bed partner had gained as much satisfaction as himself.",
      "He tried to pull out of the arms that held him so securely, wanting to give this man as much pleasure as he had felt.",
      "\"Let me...\" \"Sshh.\"",
      "The man held him fast and Philip relaxed.",
      "He was so tired, he felt so drained.",
      "His eyes closed as body, mind and soul fell under the enchanting spell woven by that strong heartbeat - and he slept in that comforting embrace.",
      "-ooOOoo- When he awoke, the light of a new day was seeping around the edges of the curtain - and his lover, his savior, of the night before had gone as if he had been part of a beautiful dream.",
      "His body still felt the warm touch of another body, as if the man had left but a moment before his eyes had opened.",
      "Philip sighed and pulled himself up to sit with his back against the headboard.",
      "A jumble of images from last evening flowed through his mind but he focused on only one; Monica.",
      "Her final words floated back to him.",
      "\"You once mentioned seeking vengeance for your grandmother - and for her family.\"",
      "Philip reached into the beside drawer and pulled out the book of mythology.",
      "--- Apollo forced his attentions upon the maiden Coronis but when pregnant with their son, Asclepius, she rebelled and returned to her first love.",
      "Artemis, twin sister to Apollo, who was ever watchful of her brother's honor, was enraged.",
      "She slew the rebellious girl with silver arrow.",
      "Asclepius was born during her death throes, watching the details of his own birth with profound attention.",
      "Her father, Phlegyas, a king of Lapiths, was so enraged at the death of his beloved daughter that he attacked Apollo's temple at Delphi - and destroyed it.",
      "For this crime he was killed by Apollo and condemned to spend eternity bound hand and foot in perpetual fear of being crushed by a large rock suspended in mid air above him by an invisible thread.",
      "--- Philip stared at the text.",
      "It was all so confusing.",
      "Certainly, Podilarius had reason to want to take revenge; for the death of his brother, for the death of his grandmother, for the eternal damnation of his great-grandfather...",
      "but Podilarius was not a god despite the divinity of his grandfather, Apollo.",
      "He had great powers of diagnosis and healing but he was still just a man - and certainly not a serpent.",
      "And, even if it was him, who was he trying to take revenge upon?",
      "Asclepius, who had the power to bring his own son, Machaon, back to life but did not?",
      "Or Apollo, who had caused such misery in his grandmother's family?",
      "There was one more question.",
      "Why had he, Philip Paget, been chosen as the instrument of this revenge?",
      "Philip let the book fall into his lap and he buried his head in his hands.",
      "There were other unanswered questions; questions that had formed since his 'rebirth'.",
      "Why had he been given this power of healing?",
      "And who were the men who came to him - and loved him?",
      "His thoughts returned to the blond stranger who had appeared out of nowhere to rescue him from the writhing mass of lust-driven bodies at the party.",
      "The man had not spoken to him, except to hush him like a mother with a small child, and he had left without a word giving Philip no opportunity to thank him.",
      "That small sense of selfishness reared itself as he remembered doing nothing to give that man any pleasure in return.",
      "It was another new feeling that was clambering the walls of what had once been a stone-cold heart.",
      "Selflessness and compassion were melting the void in his soul and, with sudden insight, Philip knew what he had to do next was appease those new feelings.",

    "text": "On the island of Rhodes, Philip came awake to find the entire room bathed in warm sunlight. He stretched, luxuriating in the feel of his own renewed vitality. His body was still thrumming with the pleasures of the night before, his nerve endings tingling with a delicious sensation that reached from the tips of his toes to the very top of his head. Even his hair felt alive. He moaned in soft appreciation of a body that was no longer haunted by pain. A self-satisfied smile curled his kiss-swollen lips and he looked across to gaze at the man he had taken to his bed last night. A frown crinkled the skin over his nose as he took in the empty place beside him. He reached out, hand skimming along the indentation where another body had lain, feeling the residual warmth. Must be in the bathroom. Five minutes later, having heard no sound coming from anywhere within the small hotel room, Philip swung his legs over the edge of the bed and hauled himself up. He gave his body another deep stretch, raising his arms high above his head as he eased the slight kink in his back. He grinned, remembering why he should ache in that particular place. His latest lover had been quite inventive, showing him there was more to being fucked than just sticking his ass into the air or throwing his legs over his lover's shoulders. He sighed, remembering how his lover had shoved his knees back until he was almost bent double, leaving him fully exposed for the supple tongue that had delved and licked across the sensitive ring of muscle. It was incredible, the remembered feel of that hardened shaft sliding into his gel-slicked body, hearing the grunts and moans of passion as he was filled. He had been unable to do anything but watch as droplets of sweat had dripped from his lover's lust-filled face onto his own heated skin. For the first time in his life he had masturbated in front of another, his own hand pumping his engorged flesh in time to the deep thrusts that powered into him. In the distance had been the sound of banging; the bedstead hitting the wall, and more distant still, the neighbors demanding an end to the noise that cut through the silence of the night. He had screamed when his lover found that special place, the sensation zinging along already highly-strung nerve endings, sending him spiraling over the edge. Philip brought his mind back to the present, and knocked on the door to the bathroom. No answer. What the fuck was his name? Oh, yes. \"Stefan? Are you in there?\" He opened the door and peered inside. Empty. With a sigh, Philip paced back to the bed and sank down onto his lumpy mattress. \"What is it with these guys?\" Since his very first homosexual encounter upon Delos, he had cruised the gay bars wherever he halted for the night and, so far, had accepted the advances of four separate men. All of them different in build and coloring, and all of them handsome. The only similarity had been the deep, longing look in their eyes that seemed to call to his very soul. Philip was the first admit that he could be vain, and he reveled in the attention he received... and in the compliments they paid him. Each one had treated him as if he were some priceless object to be revered, paying homage to his body even as their murmured words of love and desire caressed his mind. Philip gave another exaggerated sigh. The other thing they had in common was a tendency to disappear by the time he had awoken the following morning, but then, he had been the same before Delos, sneaking out before the light of the dawn seeped into the room to reveal his advancing sickness to his sexual conquest of the night before. \"Oh well, means I don't have to make small talk or buy them breakfast.\" He grinned. To be honest, so far he had not had to dip into his own limited resources at all, except to find the fare for the various island ferries. His lovers had been the ones to pay out, buying him drinks at the bar and even paying for the room where they had made love all night long. Nevertheless, Philip knew he would need to find a bank soon, especially if he wanted to move on again. He laid back down on the bed and closed his eyes. It had been more than two weeks since Delos and he could almost believe that he had *never* been ill. The Philip Padgett that had hidden in the darkness so people would not notice his sickly pallor had gone. Now he paraded in the sunlight in cutoff jeans and muscle shirts, reveling in the admiring looks from men and women alike. Women? It was strange but he had not thought about women since Delos but then, Delos had opened up a whole new vista of earthly delights that he wanted to explore to the fullest. In comparison, the restrictions of heterosexual coupling had palled for him. It was the power that he found so erotic, the physical strength of another man holding him, impaling him. Another shudder of pleasure rippled through him as his memory returned to this most recent encounter. However, he forced down his morning erection, strangely unwilling to masturbate alone while those after shocks from the previous evening were still tingling through him. Decision time. Stay or move on. He had been on Rhodes for three days and had felt he had seen all it had to offer. As he wondered where he ought to go next he realised that it was another land that now beckoned to him - Mexico. Philip knew it had to have something to do with the nightmares that plagued him whenever he slept alone. In those dreams he would *see* this wondrous mansion with its cool, white walls and beautiful gardens, placed high in the hills of northern Mexico. He was the owner, but the beautiful house seemed to hold a terrifying, dark secret. If he closed his eyes he could see strangely familiar faces filled with sickness, pain and fear of death. Those faces changed, became full of health and vitality only to then darken with fear of a different kind; fear of him. His own body seemed strange as he wandered along the corridors of that mansion and through the darkened garden paths, almost as if *he* were an unwanted lodger within it. He could feel the push of another mind, one full of venom, of putrescence that fed on the fear of others. He could feel it slither over him, suffocating him beneath its unhealthy demands for physical satisfaction. A name crawled out of the darkness - Asclepius - and yet, there was a slyness behind its offering. Philip shuddered, pushing away those thoughts before they overwhelmed him. The dreams were so vivid, so real, and yet they had to be fantasy for he had never been to Mexico. He knew the nightmares were probably just a backwash from his illness, fueled by the myths he had been subconsciously soaking up since his arrival in Greece. Perhaps it was time to leave this land of mystery after all. -ooOOoo- There was a small airport on Rhodes and Philip had no difficulty finding a flight that would take him to an international airport. He handed across his credit card and waited. \"I am sorry, sir. I cannot accept this.\" \"What?\" \"It has expired.\" Philip frowned and took the card back. He was certain it had more than a year left on it. Certainly more time than he had expected to live or he would have asked for another before leaving America. He looked at the date. \"No. You've made a mistake. See? There's almost a year left on it.\" The woman looked at him strangely as she checked the date he pointed at. \"I am sorry, sir. But the date has expired.\" Philip pulled back in confusion as he wondered if he could have been so sick that he had misread or lost track of what year it was. He turned and walked away, still staring at the embossed date as if it would magically change. \"Mind where you are going!\" \"Sorry.\" Philip reddened in embarrassment as he extricated himself from the luggage he had knocked to the floor. Suddenly, the owner gave him an appreciative leer, but Philip paid no mind to him, ignoring the honeyed words drifting after him as he moved on. \"No... my mistake, young man.\" Ahead of him, Philip had spied a small newsagent's store. He walked briskly towards it and snatched up the nearest English-written daily paper, scanning the top for a print date. His lips parted in shock when he saw the year; his card had expired - more than six years ago. \"What the...? His mind reeled from the impact. Somehow he had managed to lose seven years of his life. Philip wandered in a daze towards the washroom, not stopping until he was staring at his reflection in the mirror above the basin. He frowned as he realized he had not shaved even once since Delos, and yet his skin was as soft and smooth as the finest silk. How come he looked no different? Surely, if seven years had passed then he should have some sign of aging; new lines, the odd gray hair? But he was as beautiful as he had always believed himself to be, in fact if anything, he was more vibrant than ever. His skin glowed with health, his hair shone, his eyes were as bright as the finest emeralds and his moist lips were a sensuous dusky pink. He ran a hand over his own body, feeling the firm muscles rippling fluidly over bone. Someone had once called him an Adonis; a living work of art more beautiful than Michelangelo's David... and the stranger on Delos had called him Hyacinthus. -- Apollo was passionately in love with the young Spartan, Hyacinthus. He followed him everywhere; hunting, fishing, playing. The youth was of unsurpassed beauty and rejoiced in the affection shown to him by the equally beautiful and powerful god of the sun. There were others who also lusted after the youth. Zephyrus, god of the west wind, was one such admirer. -- His head filled with foolish ideas of conspiracies... but what had he ever done to warrant such a complicated ruse? \"What the hell do I do now?\" When he let himself calm down, it became obvious that his first point of call should be a bank. Perhaps he could access his American checking account and see if there was any money left in it, although he was certain he had cleaned it out when he decided to go on his world tour. If not then he could always try contacting the credit card company and ask them to authorize a cash withdrawal. It took more than twenty minutes to find a bank and another fifteen minutes waiting for an English-speaking clerk to become available. Eventually, he took a seat opposite a handsome Greek with short, ebony hair and dark eyes. Philip felt slightly uncomfortable as the clerk stared at him with more than mere professional courtesy, the dark eyes dilating, a pink tongue sliding over dry lips. \"How may I help you, sir?\" It did not take long to explain the situation and, after Philip handed over his passport, he waited in silence as the clerk's fingers began to dance over the keyboard in front of him. \"Hmmm? That is strange. You have been listed as recently deceased. Obviously, that is a mistake.\" The clerk grinned at him. \"However, this means that your American accounts have been frozen. However, all is not bad news. Your Swiss bank account is still open. With your permission I will set up an account for you here, and transfer some of those funds across.\" Philip frowned. He could not remember opening any Swiss bank accounts... but then, he could not remember anything of what had happened to him in the last six years of his life. He decided to bluff his way through, his face composed into the guileless expression he had cultivated as an insurance salesman in Newark. \"Sure. Go ahead.\" He watched with interest as the clerk accessed this unknown Swiss account. -ooOOoo- After several minutes of keying the clerk looked up with even greater interest and renewed respect, his eyes holding the bright green ones of the man seated opposite in appreciation of more than the American's physical beauty. He gave the American a speculative look. \"How much should I transfer, sir?\" \"Hmmm... how much is there?\" \"3,820,678.24... in American dollars.\" \"How much?\" The clerk was taken aback by his customer's exclamation. He swung the monitor around so his client could see the display, then watched as the American's face paled even further. \"Are you alright, sir? Perhaps I can get you some water.\" -ooOOoo- It had taken Philip two days of traveling but he had finally reached his destination. Up ahead he could see the mansion; it was exactly as his dream had portrayed it Or was it a dream? A growing fear was gnawing in his belly that these were not nightmares but lost memories. He wandered into the deserted compound, moving slowly through the ransacked house, his fingers trailing along the remnants of tattered curtains that had been made of the finest silks. The carpet beneath his feet was damp and grimy, as if a hundred boots had ground the dirt into it. His memory supplied visions of beautiful artwork that had been displayed to perfection on walls and pedestals - all gone. He glanced at his feet and found the remnants of shattered pottery and gave a wry smile, amending his earlier thought; it was not *all* gone, but what remained had been destroyed. Philip wandered into the library. Books were strewn around the interior, mainly lying in mildewed heaps on the damp floor. He knelt down, gathering up a few to read the titles, his eyes widening as he realised one of those contained the very information he had been hoping to find on his return from Greece. It was an encyclopedia of Greek mythology. His lack of knowledge of the Greek language had precluded him finding out this information while in that country. The top of the window seat was covered in a fine layer of plaster dust and he brushed the worst of it away before sitting down. Closing his eyes for a moment, Philip sought to order his thoughts, then swiftly turned the damp pages, searching for a particular entry. -- Asclepius, son of Apollo, was blessed with the skill of bringing the dead back to life. He used his gift freely, such was his love for mortals. This enraged the resentful Hades, god of the underworld, who in a fit of pique at losing so many of his subjects, complained to Zeus. -- Philip was confused. Asclepius hardly seemed the type to be a vindictive god who would cause - or want - others to fear him. If anything, he seemed far too kind and gentle, with an abiding love for man. The more he thought about it, the more he became certain that the serpent in his dreams was *not* Asclepius. The slyness of the inner voice that had offered up the name came back to haunt him. Philip knew that tone, had used it many a time himself to deceive others as he convinced them to buy insurance policies they did not require, playing on their guilt and their fears for themselves and for their loved ones. When he glanced out of the window, he noticed that the sky had started to darken as the sun began to set. Philip shuddered as the cool evening breeze ruffled the tatters of remaining curtain through the broken window panes. He left the library, keeping the book in his hand, and made his way through the house, allowing his feet rather than his brain to guide him. The broken furniture and ornaments that were strewn upon the stairs, mixed up with plaster that had fallen from the walls and ceilings, did little to impede his physical progress. So much destruction. Part of his heart cried out at the loss of such beauty. He had always been appreciative of the aesthetic, be it an inanimate sculpture, or a living work of art such as a beautiful man or woman. His feet guided him up the stairs and along to the very end of the corridor. Philip pushed aside the door, stepping back as it toppled off one hinge to hang askew. The final rays of the sun cast long shadows and he watched from the threshold as the darkness crept forward like a living entity to engulf the large bed that dominated the room. He knew this room, he had seen it many times in his nightmares, and he felt the fine hairs at the back of his neck rise in fear and half-remembrance. Philip turned away and made his way to the bedroom furthest from that place. The mansion was almost in darkness before he managed to light a small fire in the grate, and he sighed as the meager light pushed the encroaching shadows back to the furthest corners. The bed was covered in a fine layer of plaster dust but he swept that aside and lay down, desperately needing to sleep off the jet lag and yet strangely fearful of closing his eyes in this house. Eventually, his body gave into its fatigue and he slept - and dreamed. -- Her wide eyes were full of fear as he towered over her, he could sense it, taste it - and he reveled in it. Her long, golden hair hung loose in long tresses that shone in the moonlight, her ivory-colored nightdress shimmered giving her an ethereal quality, like a fairy queen - or a virginal sacrifice. He leaned over her, his tongue licking along the length of her exposed throat. He felt her tremble with fear, with abhorrence, but she made no move to stop him, terrified that he would make good on his pledge to send her back into a world of pain should she refuse his advances. He took her hand, feeling her rapid pulse beneath his fingers, and led her from the relative safety of her room, along the corridor to his own domain. She pulled back on the threshold, repelled by the sight that lay before her, and he turned and looked deep into her frightened, blue eyes. \"If you don't do as I say then the cancer will come back. Do you want that?\" His voice was soft, husky and yet it dripped of venom. He smiled as he watched her submit to his will and, reaching forward, the tip of his tongue lapped at the bitter tears that fell from her eyes. She allowed herself to be led to the oversize bed. His fingers, long and slender, teased at the small buttons of her nightdress then eased it from her shoulders to reveal her creamy flesh. His hands cradled her firm breasts, thumbs sliding across the dusky pink nipples until they peaked, but no desire filled her eyes. She closed them as he lay her down, her flesh crawling as the slither of dry scales coiled across her tensed body. \"Look at me, Kelly. I *said* look at me. Am I not beautiful? A body fit for a god?\" He was standing above her, naked - and he *was* beautiful - but her eyes were fixed on his hands, and he could read her terror as she watched the snake he held flick out its forked tongue to taste the fear in the air. He crawled on top of her, his fingers teasing with her virginal folds as his mouth sucked and licked and kissed a path down her throat before latching onto one nipple. He suckled upon her, his fingers seemingly delving deeper inside her body until she realised they were too large. He laughed at her when she finally looked down to see his hands to either side of her hips, her shame turning to horror as she realised it was the snake that had entered her. -- Philip sat upright, the cold perspiration of fear clinging to his flesh as the tendrils of a terrible nightmare gradually loosened their hold upon him. He could see her terrified face so clearly, could remember breathing her name in ecstasy as he finally plunged into her virgin body, filling her with his seed. He had fed on her fear, feasted on her humiliation and devoured the shame of her degradation. Night after night he went back for her, leading her to that room, forcing her into acts of depravity. He recalled her soft cries as other, equally frightened, young girls were forced to play with her while he looked on, stroking himself, even allowing his body to climax, his seed spurting over their writhing bodies. The room had crackled with the negative energy that fed the putrid spirit inhabiting his body, and he had cried out with his victims as all that he had once loved was distorted. *It* had used the images in his mind from his excessive love of porn, coercing these innocent women to act out those fantasies for his own pleasure. \"No. It wasn't me. It wasn't me.\" More images paraded across his mind, other victims moving to his every sexual whim with fear filled eyes, terrified of displeasing him lest they be cast out, afraid of their painful, life-threatening diseases returning to claim them once more. And yet there were some, like Kelly, who had willingly walked away, preferring to embrace death than live with the sordidness of his unhealthy passion. \"No. No. No. It wasn't me.\" Philip spent the remainder of the long night too terrified to close his eyes as more images assaulted him. Eventually, as the sky began to lighten with the dawn, he left the mansion, following a path through the overgrown garden until he came to the dilapidated ruins of a temple. It was here that he felt the serpent god's power strongest. Those last few moments of his former life came back to him as he stared at the brown mark that time and the weather had not erased from the dais; his blood. He had died on this spot, and the serpent god had left him, unable to save him. Further proof that it was *not* Asclepius who had extended his powers of healing through Philip's body, for Asclepius had the power to bring the dead back to life. He curled up beneath the altar stone, able at last to see through the silken lies and twisted truth that had been wrapped around him by the serpent god. The memories of those seven years came flooding back and yet he found himself viewing them from behind a misty curtain. He realised, suddenly, that he had spent seven years under the control of an evil force that pretended to be doing good. The only time he had found himself alone in his own body were those occasions when the serpent had left him to work its perverted healing power. At those times he had been so depleted of strength that he could do little but lie behind the temple, paralyzed by the heaviness of his own limbs, until the serpent returned for him. -ooOOoo- When the first rays of a new day bled across the sky, Philip raised his tired eyes and found himself transfixed by the radiant figure standing close by. His thoughts returned to the beautiful man who had stepped out of the shadows at Delos but, when he narrowed his eyes against the brightness of the sun's rays, he realised this new figure was raven-haired rather than blond. The man knelt down beside him and it was only then that Philip noticed the carpet of purple and silver larkspur that lay beneath him, cushioning him from the coldness of the earth. Caramel-colored eyes held his own, and Philip could read the desire that had enlarged the dark pupils. The man smiled, his gleaming white teeth adding further brilliance to his countenance. The stranger reached out to brush the back of his fingers down Philip's unstubbled cheek, then slowly he drew one finger across Philip's lips, sending a flicker of energy straight through to Philip's groin. Soft lips followed that finger, pressing gently against him, and Philip felt the subtle pressure of a tongue teasing between them. He sighed, his own lips parting in invitation as the kiss deepened, slowly becoming lost in the sensations as hands tease beneath his T-shirt to travel across his bare flesh. He found himself gasping as the stranger's mouth slid away to latch onto the strange sunburst tattoo at the juncture of his throat and shoulder. Something about that area was so sensitive, sending licks of fire radiating throughout his body. His limbs turned to jelly, his whole being coming alive in a blaze of passion as the man sucked and licked that recently discovered, erogenous zone. The early morning sun warmed him as his flesh was slowly bared, his clothing stripped from his body to lie in a heap beside them. The Mexican's naked body was a pleasurable sight, with firm muscle sliding beneath sun-kissed skin. The slight coarseness of his worker hands increased the tactile pleasure for Philip as they stroked across the silken flesh of one ass cheek, with one finger delving into the valley to glide across the sensitive skin, only pausing to tease at the hidden entrance to Philip's body. He arched up, wanting to feel the other man along the whole length of him, and was rewarded as the Mexican lowered himself to cover Philip like a living blanket. They writhed together, feeling the urgent need of their straining erections which were gliding through slick precome, caught between their close-pressed bodies. With passion rising to even greater heights, Philip made no protest as he was flipped onto his stomach and raised until he was fully exposed to his latest lover. Saliva-slicked fingers breached his opening, pressing deep inside as the other hand worked its own magic on his hardened flesh, squeezing and stroking across the sensitive head. Philip trembled in anticipation and an overpowering need as the man withdrew his fingers and positioned himself behind his willing body. He was entered in a single, powerful thrust that brought a cry of pleasure and pain tumbling from his swollen lips. The pace was frantic and he cried out with each deep stroke as the movement brushed across that sensitive place deep inside him, sending his own body and soul spiraling out of control until he was coming hard, his back arching, body pushing back onto that engorged cock, internal muscles clamping around the solid length that filled him so completely. His lover pounded into him once more then stilled, guttural moans filling the air as Philip felt his innards bathed in liquid fire. They both collapsed, limbs too heavy to support them any longer. Philip sighed as a tongue lapped at the drops of perspiration on the nape of his neck, still caught in the thralls of pleasure as his body melted in the afterglow. The tongue swiped across the sunburst and Philip groaned as the dying licks of energy zinged through his nerve endings. He smiled in pleasure, fully satiated, all memory of the evil of this place wiped out by the sensations that still filled him. He felt the softened shaft slip from his body, felt the other man move to the side, leaving one arm and one leg draped across him possessively. The warmth of the sun caressing his skin sent his mind drifting into pleasant dreams where he was loved and cherished and, eventually, he slept. -ooOOoo- When he awoke, the sun had moved across the sky and some inner sense told him that it was early afternoon. He was not surprised to discover that his new lover had left him all alone on the soft bed of larkspur; it seemed to be a common attribute of his current lovers. With a sigh, he cleaned himself up as best he could and dressed, pulling on the tight, figure hugging denim and sturdy walking boots. He was tempted to leave his torso bare but gave into a small sense of decorum and pulled on his light T-shirt. Philip took a last look at the ruins of the temple, gazing in acceptance at the stone snake coiled around a branch that formed the central column. He frowned. When he arrived early this morning the ground had seemed cold and bare and yet, now, it was covered in silver and purple flowers which seemed to radiate out from the base of the dais where, in his nightmares, he had fallen - and died. Coming to this place had confirmed his worst fears, that the terrible nightmares were forgotten memories breaking free. He had hoped that this place would provide all the answers to his questions, but the ransacked mansion and neglected garden had only added to the list. He picked up the book that he had carried with him from the mansion, and stored it in his backpack. Something told him that he might need it again. When he reached the main gate, Philip looked back one last time. If he wanted answers then he realised he would need to seek out one of those people whose faces had filled his dreams. His mind supplied names for a few; Monica, Kelly, Rebecca... and Edward Markham. Philip turned and walked away, knowing he would never return to this place of evil. THE END... for now. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ UPDATED: 20th September 2000",

      "But the date has expired.\"",
      "Philip pulled back in confusion as he wondered if he could have been so sick that he had misread or lost track of what year it was.",
      "He turned and walked away, still staring at the embossed date as if it would magically change.",
      "\"Mind where you are going!\"",
      "\"Sorry.\"",
      "Philip reddened in embarrassment as he extricated himself from the luggage he had knocked to the floor.",
      "Suddenly, the owner gave him an appreciative leer, but Philip paid no mind to him, ignoring the honeyed words drifting after him as he moved on.",
      "\"No... my mistake, young man.\"",
      "Ahead of him, Philip had spied a small newsagent's store.",
      "He walked briskly towards it and snatched up the nearest English-written daily paper, scanning the top for a print date.",
      "His lips parted in shock when he saw the year; his card had expired - more than six years ago.",
      "\"What the...?",
      "His mind reeled from the impact.",
      "Somehow he had managed to lose seven years of his life.",
      "Philip wandered in a daze towards the washroom, not stopping until he was staring at his reflection in the mirror above the basin.",
      "He frowned as he realized he had not shaved even once since Delos, and yet his skin was as soft and smooth as the finest silk.",
      "How come he looked no different?",
      "Surely, if seven years had passed then he should have some sign of aging; new lines, the odd gray hair?",
      "But he was as beautiful as he had always believed himself to be, in fact if anything, he was more vibrant than ever.",
      "His skin glowed with health, his hair shone, his eyes were as bright as the finest emeralds and his moist lips were a sensuous dusky pink.",
      "He ran a hand over his own body, feeling the firm muscles rippling fluidly over bone.",
      "Someone had once called him an Adonis; a living work of art more beautiful than Michelangelo's David... and the stranger on Delos had called him Hyacinthus.",
      "-- Apollo was passionately in love with the young Spartan, Hyacinthus.",
      "He followed him everywhere; hunting, fishing, playing.",
      "The youth was of unsurpassed beauty and rejoiced in the affection shown to him by the equally beautiful and powerful god of the sun.",
      "There were others who also lusted after the youth.",
      "Zephyrus, god of the west wind, was one such admirer.",
      "-- His head filled with foolish ideas of conspiracies... but what had he ever done to warrant such a complicated ruse?",
      "\"What the hell do I do now?\"",
      "When he let himself calm down, it became obvious that his first point of call should be a bank.",
      "Perhaps he could access his American checking account and see if there was any money left in it, although he was certain he had cleaned it out when he decided to go on his world tour.",
      "If not then he could always try contacting the credit card company and ask them to authorize a cash withdrawal.",
      "It took more than twenty minutes to find a bank and another fifteen minutes waiting for an English-speaking clerk to become available.",
      "Eventually, he took a seat opposite a handsome Greek with short, ebony hair and dark eyes.",
      "Philip felt slightly uncomfortable as the clerk stared at him with more than mere professional courtesy, the dark eyes dilating, a pink tongue sliding over dry lips.",
      "\"How may I help you, sir?\"",
      "It did not take long to explain the situation and, after Philip handed over his passport, he waited in silence as the clerk's fingers began to dance over the keyboard in front of him.",
      "\"Hmmm?",
      "That is strange.",
      "You have been listed as recently deceased.",
      "Obviously, that is a mistake.\"",
      "The clerk grinned at him.",
      "\"However, this means that your American accounts have been frozen.",
      "However, all is not bad news.",
      "Your Swiss bank account is still open.",
      "With your permission I will set up an account for you here, and transfer some of those funds across.\"",
      "Philip frowned.",
      "He could not remember opening any Swiss bank accounts...",
      "but then, he could not remember anything of what had happened to him in the last six years of his life.",
      "He decided to bluff his way through, his face composed into the guileless expression he had cultivated as an insurance salesman in Newark.",
      "\"Sure.",
      "Go ahead.\"",
      "He watched with interest as the clerk accessed this unknown Swiss account.",
      "-ooOOoo- After several minutes of keying the clerk looked up with even greater interest and renewed respect, his eyes holding the bright green ones of the man seated opposite in appreciation of more than the American's physical beauty.",
      "He gave the American a speculative look.",
      "\"How much should I transfer, sir?\" \"Hmmm...",
      "how much is there?\" \"3,820,678.24... in American dollars.\"",
      "\"How much?\"",
      "The clerk was taken aback by his customer's exclamation.",
      "He swung the monitor around so his client could see the display, then watched as the American's face paled even further.",
      "\"Are you alright, sir?",
      "Perhaps I can get you some water.\"",
      "-ooOOoo- It had taken Philip two days of traveling but he had finally reached his destination.",
      "Up ahead he could see the mansion; it was exactly as his dream had portrayed it Or was it a dream?",
      "A growing fear was gnawing in his belly that these were not nightmares but lost memories.",
      "He wandered into the deserted compound, moving slowly through the ransacked house, his fingers trailing along the remnants of tattered curtains that had been made of the finest silks.",
      "The carpet beneath his feet was damp and grimy, as if a hundred boots had ground the dirt into it.",
      "His memory supplied visions of beautiful artwork that had been displayed to perfection on walls and pedestals - all gone.",
      "He glanced at his feet and found the remnants of shattered pottery and gave a wry smile, amending his earlier thought; it was not *all* gone, but what remained had been destroyed.",
      "Philip wandered into the library.",
      "Books were strewn around the interior, mainly lying in mildewed heaps on the damp floor.",
      "He knelt down, gathering up a few to read the titles, his eyes widening as he realised one of those contained the very information he had been hoping to find on his return from Greece.",
      "It was an encyclopedia of Greek mythology.",
      "His lack of knowledge of the Greek language had precluded him finding out this information while in that country.",
      "The top of the window seat was covered in a fine layer of plaster dust and he brushed the worst of it away before sitting down.",
      "Closing his eyes for a moment, Philip sought to order his thoughts, then swiftly turned the damp pages, searching for a particular entry.",
      "-- Asclepius, son of Apollo, was blessed with the skill of bringing the dead back to life.",
      "He used his gift freely, such was his love for mortals.",
      "This enraged the resentful Hades, god of the underworld, who in a fit of pique at losing so many of his subjects, complained to Zeus.",
      "-- Philip was confused.",
      "Asclepius hardly seemed the type to be a vindictive god who would cause - or want - others to fear him.",
      "If anything, he seemed far too kind and gentle, with an abiding love for man.",
      "The more he thought about it, the more he became certain that the serpent in his dreams was *not* Asclepius.",
      "The slyness of the inner voice that had offered up the name came back to haunt him.",
      "Philip knew that tone, had used it many a time himself to deceive others as he convinced them to buy insurance policies they did not require, playing on their guilt and their fears for themselves and for their loved ones.",
      "When he glanced out of the window, he noticed that the sky had started to darken as the sun began to set.",
      "Philip shuddered as the cool evening breeze ruffled the tatters of remaining curtain through the broken window panes.",
      "He left the library, keeping the book in his hand, and made his way through the house, allowing his feet rather than his brain to guide him.",
      "The broken furniture and ornaments that were strewn upon the stairs, mixed up with plaster that had fallen from the walls and ceilings, did little to impede his physical progress.",
      "So much destruction.",
      "Part of his heart cried out at the loss of such beauty.",
      "He had always been appreciative of the aesthetic, be it an inanimate sculpture, or a living work of art such as a beautiful man or woman.",
      "His feet guided him up the stairs and along to the very end of the corridor.",
      "Philip pushed aside the door, stepping back as it toppled off one hinge to hang askew.",
      "The final rays of the sun cast long shadows and he watched from the threshold as the darkness crept forward like a living entity to engulf the large bed that dominated the room.",
      "He knew this room, he had seen it many times in his nightmares, and he felt the fine hairs at the back of his neck rise in fear and half-remembrance.",
      "Philip turned away and made his way to the bedroom furthest from that place.",
      "The mansion was almost in darkness before he managed to light a small fire in the grate, and he sighed as the meager light pushed the encroaching shadows back to the furthest corners.",
      "The bed was covered in a fine layer of plaster dust but he swept that aside and lay down, desperately needing to sleep off the jet lag and yet strangely fearful of closing his eyes in this house.",
      "Eventually, his body gave into its fatigue and he slept - and dreamed.",
      "-- Her wide eyes were full of fear as he towered over her, he could sense it, taste it - and he reveled in it.",
      "Her long, golden hair hung loose in long tresses that shone in the moonlight, her ivory-colored nightdress shimmered giving her an ethereal quality, like a fairy queen - or a virginal sacrifice.",
      "He leaned over her, his tongue licking along the length of her exposed throat.",
      "He felt her tremble with fear, with abhorrence, but she made no move to stop him, terrified that he would make good on his pledge to send her back into a world of pain should she refuse his advances.",
      "He took her hand, feeling her rapid pulse beneath his fingers, and led her from the relative safety of her room, along the corridor to his own domain.",
      "She pulled back on the threshold, repelled by the sight that lay before her, and he turned and looked deep into her frightened, blue eyes.",
      "\"If you don't do as I say then the cancer will come back.",
      "Do you want that?\"",
      "His voice was soft, husky and yet it dripped of venom.",
      "He smiled as he watched her submit to his will and, reaching forward, the tip of his tongue lapped at the bitter tears that fell from her eyes.",
      "She allowed herself to be led to the oversize bed.",
      "His fingers, long and slender, teased at the small buttons of her nightdress then eased it from her shoulders to reveal her creamy flesh.",
      "His hands cradled her firm breasts, thumbs sliding across the dusky pink nipples until they peaked, but no desire filled her eyes.",
      "She closed them as he lay her down, her flesh crawling as the slither of dry scales coiled across her tensed body.",
      "\"Look at me, Kelly.",
      "I *said* look at me.",
      "Am I not beautiful?",
      "A body fit for a god?\"",
      "He was standing above her, naked - and he *was* beautiful - but her eyes were fixed on his hands, and he could read her terror as she watched the snake he held flick out its forked tongue to taste the fear in the air.",
      "He crawled on top of her, his fingers teasing with her virginal folds as his mouth sucked and licked and kissed a path down her throat before latching onto one nipple.",
      "He suckled upon her, his fingers seemingly delving deeper inside her body until she realised they were too large.",
      "He laughed at her when she finally looked down to see his hands to either side of her hips, her shame turning to horror as she realised it was the snake that had entered her.",
      "-- Philip sat upright, the cold perspiration of fear clinging to his flesh as the tendrils of a terrible nightmare gradually loosened their hold upon him.",
      "He could see her terrified face so clearly, could remember breathing her name in ecstasy as he finally plunged into her virgin body, filling her with his seed.",
      "He had fed on her fear, feasted on her humiliation and devoured the shame of her degradation.",
      "Night after night he went back for her, leading her to that room, forcing her into acts of depravity.",
      "He recalled her soft cries as other, equally frightened, young girls were forced to play with her while he looked on, stroking himself, even allowing his body to climax, his seed spurting over their writhing bodies.",
      "The room had crackled with the negative energy that fed the putrid spirit inhabiting his body, and he had cried out with his victims as all that he had once loved was distorted.",
      "*It* had used the images in his mind from his excessive love of porn, coercing these innocent women to act out those fantasies for his own pleasure.",
      "\"No.",
      "It wasn't me.",
      "It wasn't me.\"",
      "More images paraded across his mind, other victims moving to his every sexual whim with fear filled eyes, terrified of displeasing him lest they be cast out, afraid of their painful, life-threatening diseases returning to claim them once more.",
      "And yet there were some, like Kelly, who had willingly walked away, preferring to embrace death than live with the sordidness of his unhealthy passion.",
      "\"No.",
      "No",
      ".",
      "No",
      ".",
      "It wasn't me.\"",
      "Philip spent the remainder of the long night too terrified to close his eyes as more images assaulted him.",
      "Eventually, as the sky began to lighten with the dawn, he left the mansion, following a path through the overgrown garden until he came to the dilapidated ruins of a temple.",
      "It was here that he felt the serpent god's power strongest.",
      "Those last few moments of his former life came back to him as he stared at the brown mark that time and the weather had not erased from the dais; his blood.",
      "He had died on this spot, and the serpent god had left him, unable to save him.",
      "Further proof that it was *not* Asclepius who had extended his powers of healing through Philip's body, for Asclepius had the power to bring the dead back to life.",
      "He curled up beneath the altar stone, able at last to see through the silken lies and twisted truth that had been wrapped around him by the serpent god.",
      "The memories of those seven years came flooding back and yet he found himself viewing them from behind a misty curtain.",
      "He realised, suddenly, that he had spent seven years under the control of an evil force that pretended to be doing good.",
      "The only time he had found himself alone in his own body were those occasions when the serpent had left him to work its perverted healing power.",
      "At those times he had been so depleted of strength that he could do little but lie behind the temple, paralyzed by the heaviness of his own limbs, until the serpent returned for him.",
      "-ooOOoo- When the first rays of a new day bled across the sky, Philip raised his tired eyes and found himself transfixed by the radiant figure standing close by.",
      "His thoughts returned to the beautiful man who had stepped out of the shadows at Delos but, when he narrowed his eyes against the brightness of the sun's rays, he realised this new figure was raven-haired rather than blond.",
      "The man knelt down beside him and it was only then that Philip noticed the carpet of purple and silver larkspur that lay beneath him, cushioning him from the coldness of the earth.",
      "Caramel-colored eyes held his own, and Philip could read the desire that had enlarged the dark pupils.",
      "The man smiled, his gleaming white teeth adding further brilliance to his countenance.",
      "The stranger reached out to brush the back of his fingers down Philip's unstubbled cheek, then slowly he drew one finger across Philip's lips, sending a flicker of energy straight through to Philip's groin.",
      "Soft lips followed that finger, pressing gently against him, and Philip felt the subtle pressure of a tongue teasing between them.",
      "He sighed, his own lips parting in invitation as the kiss deepened, slowly becoming lost in the sensations as hands tease beneath his T-shirt to travel across his bare flesh.",
      "He found himself gasping as the stranger's mouth slid away to latch onto the strange sunburst tattoo at the juncture of his throat and shoulder.",
      "Something about that area was so sensitive, sending licks of fire radiating throughout his body.",
      "His limbs turned to jelly, his whole being coming alive in a blaze of passion as the man sucked and licked that recently discovered, erogenous zone.",
      "The early morning sun warmed him as his flesh was slowly bared, his clothing stripped from his body to lie in a heap beside them.",
      "The Mexican's naked body was a pleasurable sight, with firm muscle sliding beneath sun-kissed skin.",
      "The slight coarseness of his worker hands increased the tactile pleasure for Philip as they stroked across the silken flesh of one ass cheek, with one finger delving into the valley to glide across the sensitive skin, only pausing to tease at the hidden entrance to Philip's body.",
      "He arched up, wanting to feel the other man along the whole length of him, and was rewarded as the Mexican lowered himself to cover Philip like a living blanket.",
      "They writhed together, feeling the urgent need of their straining erections which were gliding through slick precome, caught between their close-pressed bodies.",
      "With passion rising to even greater heights, Philip made no protest as he was flipped onto his stomach and raised until he was fully exposed to his latest lover.",
      "Saliva-slicked fingers breached his opening, pressing deep inside as the other hand worked its own magic on his hardened flesh, squeezing and stroking across the sensitive head.",
      "Philip trembled in anticipation and an overpowering need as the man withdrew his fingers and positioned himself behind his willing body.",
      "He was entered in a single, powerful thrust that brought a cry of pleasure and pain tumbling from his swollen lips.",
      "The pace was frantic and he cried out with each deep stroke as the movement brushed across that sensitive place deep inside him, sending his own body and soul spiraling out of control until he was coming hard, his back arching, body pushing back onto that engorged cock, internal muscles clamping around the solid length that filled him so completely.",
      "His lover pounded into him once more then stilled, guttural moans filling the air as Philip felt his innards bathed in liquid fire.",
      "They both collapsed, limbs too heavy to support them any longer.",
      "Philip sighed as a tongue lapped at the drops of perspiration on the nape of his neck, still caught in the thralls of pleasure as his body melted in the afterglow.",
      "The tongue swiped across the sunburst and Philip groaned as the dying licks of energy zinged through his nerve endings.",
      "He smiled in pleasure, fully satiated, all memory of the evil of this place wiped out by the sensations that still filled him.",
      "He felt the softened shaft slip from his body, felt the other man move to the side, leaving one arm and one leg draped across him possessively.",
      "The warmth of the sun caressing his skin sent his mind drifting into pleasant dreams where he was loved and cherished and, eventually, he slept.",
      "-ooOOoo- When he awoke, the sun had moved across the sky and some inner sense told him that it was early afternoon.",
      "He was not surprised to discover that his new lover had left him all alone on the soft bed of larkspur; it seemed to be a common attribute of his current lovers.",
      "With a sigh, he cleaned himself up as best he could and dressed, pulling on the tight, figure hugging denim and sturdy walking boots.",
      "He was tempted to leave his torso bare but gave into a small sense of decorum and pulled on his light T-shirt.",
      "Philip took a last look at the ruins of the temple, gazing in acceptance at the stone snake coiled around a branch that formed the central column.",
      "He frowned.",
      "When he arrived early this morning the ground had seemed cold and bare and yet, now, it was covered in silver and purple flowers which seemed to radiate out from the base of the dais where, in his nightmares, he had fallen - and died.",
      "Coming to this place had confirmed his worst fears, that the terrible nightmares were forgotten memories breaking free.",
      "He had hoped that this place would provide all the answers to his questions, but the ransacked mansion and neglected garden had only added to the list.",
      "He picked up the book that he had carried with him from the mansion, and stored it in his backpack.",
      "Something told him that he might need it again.",
      "When he reached the main gate, Philip looked back one last time.",
      "If he wanted answers then he realised he would need to seek out one of those people whose faces had filled his dreams.",
      "His mind supplied names for a few; Monica, Kelly, Rebecca... and Edward Markham.",
      "Philip turned and walked away, knowing he would never return to this place of evil.",
      "THE END... for now.",

    "text": "He awoke with a start, eyes wide with the residual horror of a most terrifying dream still clinging to the edges of his subconscious. A sheen of sweat glistened over his pale skin but it was the coldness of fear rather than natural perspiration. He raised his head from his makeshift pillow, his shallow breathing gradually deepening as he accepted the vivid images for what they were - a nightmare. It was only a little past dawn and the sun had not yet risen above the temple, so it had yet to send the temperature soaring into the 90s, and in the gray early morning light, everything was exactly as it had been when he fell asleep. Surrounding him were the ancient ruins of the temple of Apollo on Delos. Few of the ornately carved columns were still standing, most had fallen to lie in the dust, untouched by a people who had long given up the god for whom these pillars had first been raised. He had come to Greece to give himself a parting gift, deciding that the little money he had saved over the years would be better spent in adding memories rather than paying doctors. He wanted to prove to himself that his short life had not been a complete waste, wanted to see the wonders of the world before he succumbed to the deadly disease that was slowly eating him alive from the inside. He was riddled with cancer, but had no-one to blame but himself. No-one had forced him to smoke, and he had been well aware of the risks attached to such an addictive habit. Still, he had never dreamed he would become one of those statistics that the government warned about. Too late now to worry about that. He thought back to the small bar he had been drinking in a few nights previously. The place had been empty, being well off the usual tourist track. He had struck up a conversation with the bartender, grateful that the man had been able to speak and understand a little English. It was the bartender who had told him about this island, relating tales of pilgrims traveling to the temple to beg mercy and aid from Apollo, God of Medicine. Delos. The island that had never seen the sun until Zeus had raised it from the depths of the ocean so his beloved, Leto of the Dark Robe, could break Hera's curse and give birth to their children, Apollo and Artemis. Philip Padgett closed his tired eyes. It had been an overwhelming impulse that had made him stay here for the night, sleeping on the old altar stone. He had expected it to be uncomfortable but the stone beneath him had been worn smooth over the millennia, and his sleeping bag had provided a barrier that kept the coldness of the stone from penetrating his flesh. All in all, the night's sleep had been no worse than any he had suffered over the past months as the cancer advanced - except for the nightmare - but even bad dreams were not unusual these days as his subconscious let loose the fears he held inside; his fear of dying. Philip sat up and swung his legs over the side. If he had been hoping for some miraculous cure then he was sorely disappointed. With fingers still shaking from the strength of his dream he reached into his backpack and pulled out a bottle, shaking two tablets into the palm of one hand. The cancer riddling his body had left him in a world of pain that he stoically ignored with the help of these powerful painkillers, but no drug could ease his growing fear of death. Next, he pulled out a small tube of antiseptic from the medicine box, intending to dab a little on the snake bites he had received while investigating the ruins yesterday. In all he had been bitten four times, once on his hand with the remainder around his ankles. He gave a wry grin. Next time he would bring a walking stick and check for snakes before treading off the beaten path. He pulled back his light cotton shirt and stared in confusion at the smooth flesh. There was no sign of any swelling, nor even the puncture marks from the fangs that must surely have been left behind from the painful bite. Snatches of his nightmare came back to haunt him. There had been a snake in his dream too, a huge snake with dark coils, long sharp fangs and glowing red eyes. It had uncoiled itself from the column in front of the altar stone, slithering through a strange mist to rear up beside his paralyzed body. He remembered the terror that swept through him as the giant serpent struck at him, expecting to feel the agony of its wicked fangs penetrating his flesh but, instead, it had merged into him, disappearing inside his body. It was obvious to him now that the serpent had been conjured up by his subconscious through the story told by the bartender. Hera, queen of the gods and wife to Zeus, had been insanely jealous when she learned not only of her husband's infidelity but of the prophecy that Leto would bear children who would outshine her own. She had cursed Leto to wander the earth searching for a place that had never been touched by the sun. And to ensure Leto never found any rest, Hera had sent the Python to chase her by night and day. Why he should dream of the Python in this place was a mystery, for the myth also stated that when Zeus raised the island of Delos, he surrounded it with sharp rocks and giant sharks to keep the Python at bay while Leto gave birth. The rest of his dream was equally strange. When the dream serpent had entered his body he had been given what he had long prayed for - a cure to his sickness - but the price had been high, perhaps too high. It had taken over him, body and spirit, filling him with its own putrescence. But it was just a dream. He wiped a hand across his eyes and gave a small chuckle of relief - a feeling that turned as sour as the dream. Relief from what? After all, he was still sick... still dying. He blinked as the sun made its appearance, sending a shaft of light to pierce the greyness, and it was only then that he noticed the stranger standing just a little way off. The sun seemed to radiate from the tall, imposing figure, glinting off the golden waves that fell just short of the man's shoulders. The penetrating eyes were a deep blue, like the sky on a hot summer's day, and they were intently focused upon him. When he spoke, the man's voice was soft and melodious. \"Hyacinthus.\" \"Sorry?\" The man smiled, his face becoming even more radiant as his eyes swept over Philip's body, seeming to devour every inch of him. Philip felt his cheeks redden at the naked appreciation he saw reflected in those beautiful eyes, and was even more embarrassed at the way his own body reacted. \"Have you rested well in my temple?\" Philip's eyes widened. Suddenly, he was feeling even more flustered. \"I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was trespassing... I should have checked...\" The man held up a hand to halt Philip's stammered apology. \"It is I who should apologize, for not being here to greet you when first you arrived. But it is of little consequence now, for I am here.\" Philip licked suddenly dry lips, his discomfort rising with each passing moment. There was something strange about this man, something compelling... something that stirred his own blood. He gave a smile that was aimed more at himself than at this stranger as he considered his personal penchant for the female form. When he left America, with no intention of ever returning, he had turned his vast porn collection over to a friend, no longer satisfied with images on magnetic tape and glossy paper. He wanted the real thing, and had slept his way across Europe in a series of one night stands that gave him both the excitement he craved and a free bed for the night. Oh, he was not unaware of a man's beauty. He had been told, once, that he was beautiful, before the ravages of the disease revealed itself in the gauntness of his pallid skin and the dulling of once bright eyes. Despite this, he had received many offers from men and women alike as he traveled across from Portugal through Spain, Italy, France and eventually into Greece. Although some of those men could have been described as handsome, he had never held the slightest attraction for them, until today. The man drew closer and Philip found himself slightly in awe of the overpowering physical beauty, watching as muscles rippled under smooth, golden flesh. The light Grecian-style clothing did little to hide the man's obvious desire for him and he closed his eyes as a perfectly sculptured hand reached out to caress his cheek. \"Why so afraid?\" Philip swallowed hard and opened his eyes to find the beautiful face barely inches from him, the softly whispered words caressing him, warm breath mingling with his own. \"I'm dying.\" Philip blinked in surprise. In the flashing lights of a discotheque, or in the dimness of a bar, none of his conquests had noticed his sickness, being overcome instead by his boyish charm, and the vulnerability the disease made apparent; a vulnerability that reached out to the mothering instinct in each of them. Never had he offered up the state of his health, preferring to leave their bed before the sun rose and shattered both their illusions. Why he should give this man the truth now was a mystery, but perhaps it was merely a defense mechanism, a means of driving the lust-filled stranger away. The man smiled at him, his features holding a sense of sympathy and yet he seemed unperturbed by Philip's rash statement. He confirmed his reaction with two simple words. \"I know.\" Cool lips replaced the hand that was softly caressing his cheek and he felt himself tremble in indecision. \"Lie with me.\" \"I-I can't.. I'm not that... I've never...\" \"Experience it all. You cannot say you have lived until you have feasted on all of life's pleasures.\" Confident hands began to pluck at his clothing, slowly teasing open each button as those lips nuzzled against his heated skin, trailing down his neck in a series of licks and bites. Philip moaned deeply as the light shirt was pushed from his shoulders, the flat of a palm skimming across the planes of his hairless chest, rubbing across one nipple until it teased it into a hardened peak, sending flickers of liquid fire through his body. The busy mouth paused to suck hard at the base of his throat. Once released from the shirt, Philip's own hands moved up of their own volition, his fingers running through the thick, silky strands of golden hair before gripping tighter, holding that head in place. His chest was heaving as the man pulled away, easing out of his embrace with little effort. Philip found himself being lowered back onto the altar stone, the man following him down with strong, graceful movements, until Philip lay beneath the powerful figure. He began to tremble in fear once more as a hardness, equal to his own, pressed insistently against his belly, trapped between their close-pressed bodies. \"I will try not to hurt you.\" The man rose above him, straddling his waist, his hands reaching out once more to glide along in parallel along his ribcage and across the stiffened brown nubs, sending a bolt of passion flashing through his nerve endings. Those hands retraced their journey until they found the waistband of his jeans and, with deft movements, the button was released and the zip lowered. The man smiled, bending over with the suppleness of a gymnast, his hot mouth sucking on Philip's hardened flesh through the light cotton of his briefs. \"Oh god...\" Philip barely registered the firm pressure of hands that urged him to raise his hips, the worn denim of his jeans sliding slowly down his thighs to his knees, trapping his legs together. All the while, that talented mouth continued to suck and blow on his heated flesh through the light material. He drew in a sharp breath when fingers teased beneath the waistband of his briefs, easing the saliva and precome dampened cotton aside, freeing his straining erection from its white prison. He cried out as he was taken inside the hot mouth, his head rolling from side to side as impossible sensations flowed through him, igniting every living cell of his damaged body. Strong throat muscles clenched around the length of him before he was released, the pliant tongue twisting and coiling around the head, teasing into the slit to lap at the bitter fluid seeping from the tip, rubbing across the glans with a slight roughness that only added to the wonderful feelings that were sending him higher and higher. When he felt he could climb no further, when he was certain he had reached the pinnacle of ecstasy, the incredible sensations took him onwards and upwards. He screamed when the moment of annihilation finally washed over him, hurling him into the void where he hovered between life and death for an eternity before crashing back to earth like a fallen angel cast from heaven. A thousand images flashed through him, places and faces, reality mingled with fantasy as his earlier nightmare tore at his free-falling spirit. He saw himself as healer and abuser, caught within the grasp of the serpent with its unhealthy method of collecting the positive energy it drew upon for its own existence. He saw his own serpent-controlled body filled with a tainted desire, coercing sexual favors with half-truths and twisted lies. He heard his honeyed voice making promises of health that would hold for only as long as the serpent found pleasure with that individual's body. He cried out in horror as he saw his own death, saw his body thrown against the base of temple column, his head impacting with the sharp edge... his blood smearing across the pale stone. The serpent fled with his dying breath, afraid of becoming trapped inside the shell of the body it had used for its own ends. A sharp pain dragged Philip back from the edge of the abyss of madness, his innards exploding in white hot agony as he was penetrated by hardened flesh. He became aware of his legs raised high, supported on the man's shoulders, and he felt the bruising grip of hands upon his hips as his ass was filled with one deep thrust. Tears tracked down his face, his fingers clawing at the hard stone beneath him as the man pulled out only to thrust in deeper still. His eyes widened, mouth gaping in shock as agony transformed into ecstasy, the hardened organ rubbing against some place deep inside, sending a renewed pulse of desire cascading through him. Fingers wrapped themselves around his slowly growing erection, pumping in time to the thrusts in his ass and, gradually, he found himself arching into the rhythm, his body pushing back to drive the rigid flesh deeper. His lover stiffened, head thrown back in ecstasy, a long hard groan falling from his passion swollen lips as he emptied his seed into Philip's, now acquiescent, body. Philip sighed as hot fluid bathed his innards even as his own seed spurted across his belly and chest, coating the hand that still held him in a passionate grip. He made no sound of protest as the heavy body collapsed upon him, barely able to comprehend the sensations still rippling along his nerve endings as he basked in the afterglow, his body feeling more alive now than had in months. Eventually the weight shifted, the man - his lover - easing up onto forearms, those lips descending to take his own for the first time, with a gentleness that belied the man's physical strength. That flexible tongue parted his lips, coiling against his own, tasting and exploring the hot cavern of his mouth with a sense of homecoming. When their lips finally parted, Philip smiled drowsily, and found an answering grin above him. His lover bestowed one final kiss upon him and then rolled to the side, gathering his depleted body into his arms, bringing Philip's head across until it was pillowed on the broad expanse of chest. Philip slept. -ooOOoo- The sound of distant voices called him back from a deep, dreamless sleep. Philip smiled hazily and looked across, intending to awaken his new lover but there was no-one there and, looking around, he could see no sign of anyone else having ever been present. Was it just another dream? If it was a dream then he hoped he would have many more like that. He looked down at his strangely pain-free body, his eyes widening when he realised he was naked, his belly smeared with dried semen. Philip sat up and stretched, feeling a renewed vigor seeping into his very bones, but he hissed suddenly at the ache that made itself known, a burning sensation in his ass. His fingers dipped lower to investigate, and came back smeared lightly in blood and semen. Not a dream then... so where did his lover go? The voices that had awoken him were drawing closer, pushing any further thought aside as he quickly cleaned and dressed himself. He was amazed that he had not suffered sunburn while he lay sleeping for the sun was now high in the sky, close to midday. He had barely finished dressing when the first person came around from behind the columns, followed soon after by another. Tourists, like himself, but these ones were laden down with cameras. A third person appeared who was, obviously, a guide and Philip felt compelled to approach him. \"Excuse me. Can you tell me where the man who owns this land lives?\" The guide looked at him askance, bemusement written over his face. \"No one owns this land... it belongs to the all of the people of Delos.\" \"Oh... But there was a man here earlier, said this temple was his. He was a tall man. Blond, blue eyes, very good looking.\" The guide gave a sudden, knowing smile as he gazed upon the beautiful green-eyed, dark-haired American. \"May I?\" Philip stood still as the guide reached forward and moved aside the collar of his shirt, revealing the place where his strangely absent lover had sucked deeply to leave his mark upon the vulnerable flesh. The guide smiled. \"You have been blessed.\" \"Blessed?\" The guide turned and walked away, leaving Philip staring in puzzlement at the man's receding back. Philip shook his head and picked up his backpack, leaving the temple to the newly-arrived tourists. Having spent the whole day searching in vain, Philip returned to the temple. He bedded down for the night as before, but when morning came he was still alone. By noon that day he decided to move on. As he retraced his footsteps of a few days earlier back down to the small harbor, he realised that, for the first time in ages, he did not feel the weariness or pain that had enveloped him for months. He barely had time to grab a light meal before the small ferry arrived and could only look back with fond memories as the boat sailed away. -ooOOoo- A few hours later he was settling himself into a sparsely furnished but clean and comfortable room above the local tavern. He stripped off his dirty clothes and stared hard at his own body, convinced that there was something different about himself. Philip strode off to the small communal bathroom. After climbing from the welcoming shower, he took a good look at himself in the full length mirror. His skin, barely visible in the steamed up mirror, glistened with drops of warm water. Philip wiped some of the steam away and stared at his own reflection in confusion. Dew drops were clinging to his long, dark lashes but it was his own eyes that captivated him. The dullness from sickness and pain had gone. His eyes were bright, the deep green with a golden corona around the dark pupil shining with renewed vitality. His skin, so pallid these passed months, had taken on a healthy glow. Even his hair felt alive. And the pain that had become his constant companion was strangely absent. He peered in closer, examining the mark on his throat, remembering how the guide had reacted on seeing it. He had assumed this was just a hickey, the guide merely expressing his appreciation for such an obvious sign of recently experienced passion. Now, he realised the mark was not a bruise that would fade away in a few days, it looked as permanent as a tattoo; a tattoo shaped like a sunburst. -ooOOoo- The doctor in Athens had been confused when he asked for x-rays to see how far advanced his cancer had become, but had agreed nonetheless. Now, Philip could understand why. He looked at the image in disbelief. He had already sent them back once, positive they had made a mistake and brought up the wrong set, but this time he knew there was no error. The cancer had gone. His first thought was to take the next plane back to America, to continue on with his life where he had left off all those months ago, but as he brought out his credit card, intending on handing it over to the pretty girl at the airline counter, he paused. What did he have to go back for? All that had changed was his health. He still had a world to see, things to do, dreams to make real. Philip gave the girl an apologetic smile and stood back, then he turned and walked away. Whether that amazing lover had been a mere stranger taking advantage of him in the hazy early morning light, or whether he had been Apollo himself, descended from Olympus to take pleasure in a mortal who had reminded him of a long lost love, it didn't matter. The encounter had opened Philip's heart, body and mind to a wonderful new world of pleasure. He smiled as he wandered back through the streets of Athens. For some inexplicable reason he had been given a second chance at life. And this time he intended to live his life to the full. THE END",

      "You cannot say you have lived until you have feasted on all of life's pleasures.\"",
      "Confident hands began to pluck at his clothing, slowly teasing open each button as those lips nuzzled against his heated skin, trailing down his neck in a series of licks and bites.",
      "Philip moaned deeply as the light shirt was pushed from his shoulders, the flat of a palm skimming across the planes of his hairless chest, rubbing across one nipple until it teased it into a hardened peak, sending flickers of liquid fire through his body.",
      "The busy mouth paused to suck hard at the base of his throat.",
      "Once released from the shirt, Philip's own hands moved up of their own volition, his fingers running through the thick, silky strands of golden hair before gripping tighter, holding that head in place.",
      "His chest was heaving as the man pulled away, easing out of his embrace with little effort.",
      "Philip found himself being lowered back onto the altar stone, the man following him down with strong, graceful movements, until Philip lay beneath the powerful figure.",
      "He began to tremble in fear once more as a hardness, equal to his own, pressed insistently against his belly, trapped between their close-pressed bodies.",
      "\"I will try not to hurt you.\"",
      "The man rose above him, straddling his waist, his hands reaching out once more to glide along in parallel along his ribcage and across the stiffened brown nubs, sending a bolt of passion flashing through his nerve endings.",
      "Those hands retraced their journey until they found the waistband of his jeans and, with deft movements, the button was released and the zip lowered.",
      "The man smiled, bending over with the suppleness of a gymnast, his hot mouth sucking on Philip's hardened flesh through the light cotton of his briefs.",
      "\"Oh god...\" Philip barely registered the firm pressure of hands that urged him to raise his hips, the worn denim of his jeans sliding slowly down his thighs to his knees, trapping his legs together.",
      "All the while, that talented mouth continued to suck and blow on his heated flesh through the light material.",
      "He drew in a sharp breath when fingers teased beneath the waistband of his briefs, easing the saliva and precome dampened cotton aside, freeing his straining erection from its white prison.",
      "He cried out as he was taken inside the hot mouth, his head rolling from side to side as impossible sensations flowed through him, igniting every living cell of his damaged body.",
      "Strong throat muscles clenched around the length of him before he was released, the pliant tongue twisting and coiling around the head, teasing into the slit to lap at the bitter fluid seeping from the tip, rubbing across the glans with a slight roughness that only added to the wonderful feelings that were sending him higher and higher.",
      "When he felt he could climb no further, when he was certain he had reached the pinnacle of ecstasy, the incredible sensations took him onwards and upwards.",
      "He screamed when the moment of annihilation finally washed over him, hurling him into the void where he hovered between life and death for an eternity before crashing back to earth like a fallen angel cast from heaven.",
      "A thousand images flashed through him, places and faces, reality mingled with fantasy as his earlier nightmare tore at his free-falling spirit.",
      "He saw himself as healer and abuser, caught within the grasp of the serpent with its unhealthy method of collecting the positive energy it drew upon for its own existence.",
      "He saw his own serpent-controlled body filled with a tainted desire, coercing sexual favors with half-truths and twisted lies.",
      "He heard his honeyed voice making promises of health that would hold for only as long as the serpent found pleasure with that individual's body.",
      "He cried out in horror as he saw his own death, saw his body thrown against the base of temple column, his head impacting with the sharp edge... his blood smearing across the pale stone.",
      "The serpent fled with his dying breath, afraid of becoming trapped inside the shell of the body it had used for its own ends.",
      "A sharp pain dragged Philip back from the edge of the abyss of madness, his innards exploding in white hot agony as he was penetrated by hardened flesh.",
      "He became aware of his legs raised high, supported on the man's shoulders, and he felt the bruising grip of hands upon his hips as his ass was filled with one deep thrust.",
      "Tears tracked down his face, his fingers clawing at the hard stone beneath him as the man pulled out only to thrust in deeper still.",
      "His eyes widened, mouth gaping in shock as agony transformed into ecstasy, the hardened organ rubbing against some place deep inside, sending a renewed pulse of desire cascading through him.",
      "Fingers wrapped themselves around his slowly growing erection, pumping in time to the thrusts in his ass and, gradually, he found himself arching into the rhythm, his body pushing back to drive the rigid flesh deeper.",
      "His lover stiffened, head thrown back in ecstasy, a long hard groan falling from his passion swollen lips as he emptied his seed into Philip's, now acquiescent, body.",
      "Philip sighed as hot fluid bathed his innards even as his own seed spurted across his belly and chest, coating the hand that still held him in a passionate grip.",
      "He made no sound of protest as the heavy body collapsed upon him, barely able to comprehend the sensations still rippling along his nerve endings as he basked in the afterglow, his body feeling more alive now than had in months.",
      "Eventually the weight shifted, the man - his lover - easing up onto forearms, those lips descending to take his own for the first time, with a gentleness that belied the man's physical strength.",
      "That flexible tongue parted his lips, coiling against his own, tasting and exploring the hot cavern of his mouth with a sense of homecoming.",
      "When their lips finally parted, Philip smiled drowsily, and found an answering grin above him.",
      "His lover bestowed one final kiss upon him and then rolled to the side, gathering his depleted body into his arms, bringing Philip's head across until it was pillowed on the broad expanse of chest.",
      "Philip slept.",
      "-ooOOoo- The sound of distant voices called him back from a deep, dreamless sleep.",
      "Philip smiled hazily and looked across, intending to awaken his new lover but there was no-one there and, looking around, he could see no sign of anyone else having ever been present.",
      "Was it just another dream?",
      "If it was a dream then he hoped he would have many more like that.",
      "He looked down at his strangely pain-free body, his eyes widening when he realised he was naked, his belly smeared with dried semen.",
      "Philip sat up and stretched, feeling a renewed vigor seeping into his very bones, but he hissed suddenly at the ache that made itself known, a burning sensation in his ass.",
      "His fingers dipped lower to investigate, and came back smeared lightly in blood and semen.",
      "Not a dream then...",
      "so where did his lover go?",
      "The voices that had awoken him were drawing closer, pushing any further thought aside as he quickly cleaned and dressed himself.",
      "He was amazed that he had not suffered sunburn while he lay sleeping for the sun was now high in the sky, close to midday.",
      "He had barely finished dressing when the first person came around from behind the columns, followed soon after by another.",
      "Tourists, like himself, but these ones were laden down with cameras.",
      "A third person appeared who was, obviously, a guide and Philip felt compelled to approach him.",
      "\"Excuse me.",
      "Can you tell me where the man who owns this land lives?\"",
      "The guide looked at him askance, bemusement written over his face.",
      "\"No one owns this land...",
      "it belongs to the all of the people of Delos.\"",
      "\"Oh...",
      "But there was a man here earlier, said this temple was his.",
      "He was a tall man.",
      "Blond, blue eyes, very good looking.\"",
      "The guide gave a sudden, knowing smile as he gazed upon the beautiful green-eyed, dark-haired American.",
      "\"May I?\" Philip stood still as the guide reached forward and moved aside the collar of his shirt, revealing the place where his strangely absent lover had sucked deeply to leave his mark upon the vulnerable flesh.",
      "The guide smiled.",
      "\"You have been blessed.\"",
      "\"Blessed?\"",
      "The guide turned and walked away, leaving Philip staring in puzzlement at the man's receding back.",
      "Philip shook his head and picked up his backpack, leaving the temple to the newly-arrived tourists.",
      "Having spent the whole day searching in vain, Philip returned to the temple.",
      "He bedded down for the night as before, but when morning came he was still alone.",
      "By noon that day he decided to move on.",
      "As he retraced his footsteps of a few days earlier back down to the small harbor, he realised that, for the first time in ages, he did not feel the weariness or pain that had enveloped him for months.",
      "He barely had time to grab a light meal before the small ferry arrived and could only look back with fond memories as the boat sailed away.",
      "-ooOOoo- A few hours later he was settling himself into a sparsely furnished but clean and comfortable room above the local tavern.",
      "He stripped off his dirty clothes and stared hard at his own body, convinced that there was something different about himself.",
      "Philip strode off to the small communal bathroom.",
      "After climbing from the welcoming shower, he took a good look at himself in the full length mirror.",
      "His skin, barely visible in the steamed up mirror, glistened with drops of warm water.",
      "Philip wiped some of the steam away and stared at his own reflection in confusion.",
      "Dew drops were clinging to his long, dark lashes but it was his own eyes that captivated him.",
      "The dullness from sickness and pain had gone.",
      "His eyes were bright, the deep green with a golden corona around the dark pupil shining with renewed vitality.",
      "His skin, so pallid these passed months, had taken on a healthy glow.",
      "Even his hair felt alive.",
      "And the pain that had become his constant companion was strangely absent.",
      "He peered in closer, examining the mark on his throat, remembering how the guide had reacted on seeing it.",
      "He had assumed this was just a hickey, the guide merely expressing his appreciation for such an obvious sign of recently experienced passion.",
      "Now, he realised the mark was not a bruise that would fade away in a few days, it looked as permanent as a tattoo; a tattoo shaped like a sunburst.",
      "-ooOOoo- The doctor in Athens had been confused when he asked for x-rays to see how far advanced his cancer had become, but had agreed nonetheless.",
      "Now, Philip could understand why.",
      "He looked at the image in disbelief.",
      "He had already sent them back once, positive they had made a mistake and brought up the wrong set, but this time he knew there was no error.",
      "The cancer had gone.",
      "His first thought was to take the next plane back to America, to continue on with his life where he had left off all those months ago, but as he brought out his credit card, intending on handing it over to the pretty girl at the airline counter, he paused.",
      "What did he have to go back for?",
      "All that had changed was his health.",
      "He still had a world to see, things to do, dreams to make real.",
      "Philip gave the girl an apologetic smile and stood back, then he turned and walked away.",
      "Whether that amazing lover had been a mere stranger taking advantage of him in the hazy early morning light, or whether he had been Apollo himself, descended from Olympus to take pleasure in a mortal who had reminded him of a long lost love, it didn't matter.",
      "The encounter had opened Philip's heart, body and mind to a wonderful new world of pleasure.",
      "He smiled as he wandered back through the streets of Athens.",
      "For some inexplicable reason he had been given a second chance at life.",
      "And this time he intended to live his life to the full.",
      "THE END"
