    "text": "Minerva had just cloned one olive tree into twenty with a wave of her hand when the raucous music started, echoing through the entire protobubble. It was Diana, of course, using that irritating bit of code she'd sneaked into Minerva's private 'bubble. She knew from experience that if she tried to ignore it, her half-sister's music would keep playing more and more loudly until she was forced to answer the call. She scowled, watching the reflection of her avatar in the side of the protobubble scowl back at her. She swore under her breath, took a last look at the original olive-tree rendering, with its perfect symmetric leaves, and made the hand gesture to exit the simweb. The glowing colors of simspace desaturated as she heard around her the indistinct roaring sound Neptune had never been able to entirely eliminate from the hardware. As the noise receded, she took off the sim helmet and rubbed her temples at the inevitable slight headache that followed a long stay in the simweb. She must have been there for longer than she'd thought, engrossed in the details of building her city. Well. This was not so different from Olympus Worlds' millions of customers, really: the users who wandered simspace to meet new friends' avatars or virtually interact with old ones, to surround themselves with simulated opulence or something as close to their imagined version of reality as possible. The advent of the immersive sim hardware had taken the avatar-based large online user system from the realm of games to that of the dominant recreational activity for anyone with simnet access. The vast majority of their customers wanted simply to enjoy the simworlds that made up simspace -- the worlds varied from small and simplistic to large and complex. But there were those who wanted to create as well as consume. Minerva was the best of Jove's children at shaping the simeb, but with all her current responsibilities, she didn't get as much of a chance to play in simspace as she once had. She set the sim helmet down on her large black desk, where it clinked lightly against her nameplate. Minerva Fulgens, Vice-President, Head of Upper-Level Simweb Development. She smiled, running a finger over the letters. She'd worked so hard to convince her father that she, the child of his bitter first wife, was worthy to be part of the company, to be trusted; that she had the legitimacy to be the twelfth member of the executive team. But all the late nights, all the hard work, had finally paid off. She took a deep breath and made her way down the hallway to Diana's office. It was a little bigger, a little more ostentatious with its full-length glass windows and glass desk, though the piles of graphs and charts on the desk rather spoiled the effect. Diana looked up from her six-monitor display. \"Finally back in meatspace, eh, Minerva?\" Minerva's lips quirked. Diana liked to boast about how rarely she went into simspace, declaring that it was for people who couldn't handle honest work with a keyboard. \"We can't all be lower-level coders, Diana. What's going on?\" Diana rolled her eyes. \"You've forgotten about the exec meeting, haven't you?\" Minerva swore. \"Yeah, I did.\" The meetings were never held in simspace, which would have been much easier for her, because of the well-known but rarely-discussed security holes hackers sometimes found. She wasn't looking forward to it at all, but Minerva wasn't going to skip out on one of Jove's meetings, not now that he had really accepted her as one of the company, one of the family. One of them. However, the downside of the company's executive management team being made up of Jove Fulgens' brothers and sisters and children -- and most of Jove's children were half-siblings -- was that at least half of the meetings always consisted of interfamily squabbles. Still, family was the important thing. None of the Fulgens family -- the Olympians, as they were colloquially known to the rest of the world -- were willing to cede any of the control of the company to an outsider. They fought constantly, but Minerva knew that they always worked together when anything threatened, such as Prometheus Systems, the creator of the simweb and once their greatest competitor. Prometheus Systems was gone, razed to the ground and its CEO locked away for the rest of his life, and Olympus Worlds was now without a serious rival in the simspace business. Diana laughed, getting to her feet. \"All right, sis, well, you know about the meeting now.\" She gestured theatrically for Minerva to precede her out the door, and the two of them started walking along the high-ceilinged glass-and-marble halls of Olympus' main building. \"How's the strategic plan going? Is the external content provider thing working out for you?\" Minerva had been the one to push the outsourcing of much of the upper-level sim development to anyone outside the company who was interested, with Olympus taking a cut when other simspace users used their products. She shrugged. It was hard to tell, sometimes, whether Diana was trying to help or to probe her for weaknesses. On the other hand, Diana had told her about the exec meeting; that was something. \"You'll hear the latest numbers in the meeting. I think it's working out very well, personally. There's quite a community that's built up among the external developers.\" \"As long as you don't waste too much time doing it yourself,\" Diana said, looking amused. \"You're a vice-president now, you know.\" Minerva winced at the reminder of her stolen time in the simnet. Diana shook her head. \"I don't know about using people outside the company. I wouldn't be able to deal with the loss of control, myself.\" Minerva resisted the urge to sigh. Diana was famous within the company for coming down hard on any of the drones in her department whose work didn't meet her standards; her turnover rate was the highest in the company. \"You know everything gets vetted carefully in the dev environment, before the sterile seal is broken on the protobubbles and the work is allowed to get out into the wider simworld. And it's not a question of control, not exactly. We could eliminate all the 'bubbles if we wanted, of course. But remember the bad press Prometheus Systems got, that uproar when it recalled the Pandora module? Just think what the PR department would say if I started deleting work right and left.\" Diana rolled her eyes. \"Oh, Venus. Whatever. As if that girl has ever seen a line of code in her life! If it weren't for marrying into the family, she'd never have a job here at all, much less head of PR. She has no clue what's involved in good code --\" As they entered the conference room, the conversation petered out as they quickly took their seats and the meeting began. The first couple of presentations, Minerva had to admit, were quite good. Neptune discussed the coming tactile improvements to the hardware, which would finally allow users to finally feel as if they were touching other things in simspace with their avatars. Diana's testing results on the Alecto corporate-espionage virus were especially interesting; she showed an animated visualization, glittering above the projection table, of the virus ravaging code. It left unusable dreck in its wake, while using sophisticated algorithms to seek out and find any backup code the instant it was connected to any sort of simnet. \"This visualization is logarithmic in showing what code remains; there's less than a part in a million left in a matter of seconds,\" Diana said, flashing a quick smile at the others around the table. The meeting went downhill almost immediately after that, however, when Juno and Venus started arguing about an HR fraternization policy which an intern had violated. It came to light, not too far into the discussion, that the intern in question was Venus' son Aeneas. Jove tried to defuse tensions, but this had just led to his wife and daughter-in-law both turning on him, Juno accusing him of all sorts of affairs that were probably, alas, true. \"Enough,\" Jove roared finally, in a lull where Juno and Venus had temporarily run out of invectives to hurl at one another. \"Let's get on with this meeting. Minerva?\" Minerva started to talk, pulling her 3D-graphs onto the projection table with a wave of her hand and a quick voice-authorization. Jove bent forward to examine the rotating charts. \"Those trendlines are worrying,\" said Apollo. He aimed a virtual-pointer at it, circling the data in question. \"The rate of microtransactions for the externally-generated content appears to be leveling off, in a way not conducive to the kind of aggressive business model our family has typically pursued.\" \"You can't expect exponential growth forever --\" Minerva started. \"Wasn't it true,\" Diana put in, \"that one of the arguments for this model was the --\" she made a vague motion that mimicked the gesture used to pull up information in simspace -- \"the 'continued renewing of fresh content due to synergistic collaboration effects'?\" \"What's needed, perhaps,\" interposed Venus, looking bored, \"is more personal guidance from upper management. If Minerva were to, say, oversee some of the protobubble approvals herself, the PR value would more than make up for her time commitment.\" \"But--\" Jove waved a dismissive hand. \"Diana, you and Apollo follow up on it with Minerva, okay?\" he asked, for all the world as if Minerva were a young brat who needed constant supervision. Minerva grimaced. Diana smirked. \"Sure, Dad.\" Later, as they walked out of the meeting, Diana said to her, \"Let's have dinner next week when you've had a chance to think through it a bit more. Then we can charge it to the company. Eh, don't take Dad so seriously, you know how he gets when Stepmom's been poking at him. We're family, right?\" Minerva breathed out. She never knew which face of Diana was the real one, this friendly one or the cold one in the meeting. \"Dinner. Sure. Where?\" \"How does Ambrosia sound?\" Trust Diana to pick the extremely trendy, extremely expensive restaurants. \"Sounds good.\" \"A week from today, then. Eight o'clock?\" It was a deadline, Minerva knew. She nodded. * As Minerva walked through the airy halls in her simweb protobubble a week later, she heard a chime ring through it. Good, that would be Arachne, the external developer her staff had found for her, the most promising one currently in the system. Arachne's protobubble had passed all the checks in the previous months, and all the forms had been signed; Minerva's final lowering of the 'bubble barrier, so that all of Arachne's work could spill out into the simworld, would be almost a formality. She reached up with her hand, saying, \"Information on Arachne, written-form, please.\" The system responded by providing her with a readout on the wall of the 'bubble. She peered at it. The reviews from the lower-level managers were all glowing and filled with superlatives, but quite vague. She raised an eyebrow. Something to follow up on later, perhaps. And here was the stillshot of Arachne's avatar. It was tagged as an image of her real self in meatspace, a simple rendering based on a webcam, probably meaning that she had no money to buy one of the custom avatars. Minerva's avatar was also usually her real face and body, but it was because she was one of the Olympians. It was useful for the Olympians' avatars to be recognizable throughout simspace, and in any case her real-self avatar had distinct advantages over Arachne's both genetically and monetarily. Arachne wasn't very old, perhaps in her early twenties, but her face was plain at best and sported a bad case of acne. Her clothes were generic and looked a little too big for her, nothing like Minerva's hand-tailored suits. Well, she had let the girl wait long enough. Minerva snapped her fingers, saying, \"Let Arachne enter.\" A light grew between two pillars, and Arachne walked out of them. \"Welcome, Arachne. I am Minerva Fulgens.\" Arachne looked suitably excited and nervous at hearing her name, though of course she must have recognized Minerva's avatar. \"Olympus has been very impressed by your work, and I just wanted to talk to you for a bit before I give the final okay for releasing your work. In the meantime --\" she flung out an arm -- \"this is my protobubble.\" Minerva always enjoyed showing her work to someone for the first time; enjoyed seeing the look of awe on the person's face. She watched Arachne take in the tall white pillars stretching to the impossibly blue sky, the shining tiles, the grove of olive trees arranged symmetrically off in the distance. \"Well, Arachne,\" Minerva said, smiling modestly, \"what do you think?\" \"It's very beautiful. You clearly worked very hard on this.\" There was a note of something in the girl's voice, a quizzical look on her face. It wasn't quite what Minerva had been expecting. She frowned. \"Yes. Well.\" She decided to cut short the visit she had planned. \"Shall we see your work now?\" Arachne, glancing up at her, seemed to fold in on herself. \"Yes, of course,\" said Arachne humbly. That was more like it. \"But I don't know how to get there from here --\" Minerva smiled indulgently at the girl. \"You don't have the authority here, in any case, but I can get us there.\" Minerva made the appropriate gesture with her hands, saying, \"Arachne's protobubble.\" They appeared in ruins. Towering walls retained the look of a once-vast palace, but the broken masonry was coarse and discolored, almost eaten away, as if by age and wear. Old moldy walls were overgrown with vegetation. There was a general feeling of decay. The direction and quality of the light gave the illusion that it was late in the day, even though no overt source of light was visible. \"You did all this yourself?\" The level of verisimilitude was astonishing: the variegated patterns of mold, the wild disorderliness of the overgrown vines, grass sprouting from irregular cracks in the floor tiles. She walked over to a vine to take a closer look; all the leaves were different, with little imperfections that must have taken forever to program in. \"Yes,\" said Arachne. The girl was jittery, bouncing on the balls of her feet so much that Minerva almost wondered whether there was something wrong with the rendering of her avatar. \"My best friend and I did it all. Well, I did most of it -- when she couldn't, anymore, I kept it on. It's been my whole life for years. I had to make sure that it was the best work possible.\" A white bull ambled in. Minerva could have sworn she could discern the individual hairs on the creature's head. As she watched, the head of the bull subtly changed until it was more human than bull; but the contours of the bull's head were still present in the lines of the man's face. Minerva was, despite herself, impressed. \"I do think this is excellent work, Arachne,\" Minerva conceded. \"I feel pretty confident in telling you that we can break the protobubble seal, at which point all of this will be released into the wider simspace. I'm sure a lot of people will pick it up.\" Arachne said, \"I was hoping, Minerva -\" She paused. Her fingers twisted together. \"If you could help publicize it, I'd be very grateful -\" \"I can,\" said Minerva, \"although your work will speak for itself; this kind of quality is something that many people will want to incorporate in their world-building.\" She hesitated. Arachne's threadbare avatar - \"Are you worried about royalties? I have no doubt that there will be a wide demand for this work. If you need an advance, I'm so confident people will want this that I'm sure we could arrange --\" \"Oh, no, no,\" Arachne said hastily, \"I mean, well, of course royalties would be nice, I could certainly use the cash, but it's a secondary consideration, I just want the work to be widely known.\" Minerva nodded sagely. She'd come across the type before, the sort who wanted fame over fortune, the kind of coder who was obsessed with having her name known across the simweb. \"Ah, so you'll be wanting a little advertisement. If you have a nice little code snippet -- something small, mobile, that people will find interesting, that can be widely disseminated -- that'll do the trick for advertising. And if you make sure to sign your creations, say, a little signature on the leaves here, we can make your work into a brand --\" \"Oh no,\" Arachne said, \"my name doesn't need to be attached.\" Minerva raised an eyebrow. As she did so, a small spider came ambling into view on a branch. As Minerva watched, fascinated, the spider wove an iridescent web, with a hypnotic pattern that shifted fluidly even as Minerva bent to examine it. \"Well,\" Minerva said, gesturing at the spider, \"that's your killer code snippet right there. And I assume it self-propagates?\" At Arachne's nod, Minerva went on, \"There you go. Once it's in the system, it'll make its way into just about every corner of simspace, until every user has seen one of these little creatures. Now, Olympus won't pay royalties for this kind of little stowaway, that's the catch, but for publicizing your work, it's perfect.\" Arachne smiled. Her face was transformed when she smiled - one forgot that her face was plain, Minerva thought, and remembered only the joy in the smile. \"That's exactly what I want to hear.\" The shimmering spiderweb really was quite fascinating; it invited the eye. Minerva leaned closer, compelled by the moving patterns. \"I don't know if --\" And the pattern inverted and opened up into a vortex, a dizzying spiral, the noise of a whirlwind surging above her. It felt as if she were falling into the image, but of course it was only an illusion of simspace. It was simply a mirage induced by the coding of the spiderweb, which even as she watched resolved into tiny pictures, of all the Olympians in turn; and the sound of the wind became Arachne's voice. \"The Fulgens family has a history of systematic, over-the-top, and in many cases illegal repression of anyone who doesn't agree with them. Many individuals and families have been torn apart, and for what crime? For getting in the way of the Fulgens family.\" Minerva could not look away. A series of still pictures flicked by: Jove with his arm around one woman, then another; Minerva recognized a couple of them as the more famous of his many mistresses. Another picture, an extremely attractive woman Minerva didn't know, became a progression of pictures of the same woman where the dazzling beauty dimmed, turned to ashes. \"Jove Fulgens destroyed Antiope Hyria. All she wanted was support for the twins he fathered on her. He took the boys from her and systematically wiped out all her options until she went mad.\" A short 2D vid of Diana and Apollo, the twins laughing about something, Diana carelessly flinging back a wave of golden hair over her shoulder; then a beautiful, arrogant-looking woman whose face changed, as Minerva watched, into something haggard and unhappy: \"Diana and Apollo Fulgens ruined Niobe Tantalus and her company, bringing seven sham patent cases against it and manufacturing evidence against her. Then by means unknown they managed to annihilate all seven modules of Niobe's code --\" Minerva was so angry she couldn't say anything. Lies, these were all lies; who was this woman, to spread such vile slanders about her family? Arachne said timidly, \"You can either tap on the web or give it voice commands to learn more about any of the --\" Minerva ripped the web from the vine and held it distastefully between two fingers. \"Why,\" Minerva said, noticing distantly that her voice was surprisingly level and calm, \"did you do this?\" \"We were as close as sisters, Antiope and I,\" Arachne said thickly. \"Closer. And now I can't -- she doesn't even recognize me. I went through a bad time.\" Her lips trembled. \"And then I thought -- this was a way I could make her life mean something --\" Minerva turned finally to look at her. Tears were running down her face. The bull made a small distressed sound; its face, now wholly human, Minerva recognized as Jove's face. \"It's all documented,\" said Arachne, her voice wobbling. \"I did a lot of research, I talked to a lot of people, I found records, papers. It's all true, there's nothing in there that's not totally true. I knew I couldn't just publish the knowledge, the Olympians would shut me up like they did her. But if I could somehow get it into the sim itself, and the knowledge could spread -- if I could get one of the Olympians on my side - and everyone says you're the most impartial of the Olympians --\" Minerva stared at the other girl, avatar to avatar. She suddenly realized that the quizzical expression on Arachne's face in Minerva's protobubble, the one that she hadn't been able to decipher, had been patronizing. \"No.\" She watched Arachne's face crumble. \"You come to me, thinking you're better than I am, and you expect me to help you mock my family?\" She snapped her fingers: \"Remove, recursive-force, top-level authorization, Minerva Fulgens.\" The leaves started to disappear, one by one. \"You're deleting it all, my whole bubble-\" Arachne cried, unbelieving. The spider quietly faded away. \"No, no, you can't do this --\" Her voice rose to a shriek. \"This is our work, all that I have left of her, this is my life -\" The shapes started to unravel around them, the ruins silently dissolving into nothingness. \"You should have thought of that before you mocked me and my family,\" Minerva said coldly. Everything had disappeared; what had once been the protobubble was now merely a void. \"It's gone.\" Arachne dropped to her knees, an expression of blank all-consuming misery on her face. \"She's gone. There's nothing left.\" Minerva reached out a hand, a bit concerned. \"Arachne --\" \"Don't touch me,\" Arachne spat. \"You're going to come after me, and after me, just like he did, just like your sister did to Niobe, drive me to madness or jail or something worse --\" Minerva forebore to mention that one could not, technically, touch another person in simspace, at least not until Neptune finished his sensory improvements. \"Arachne,\" Minerva said, striving to remain reasonable, although she was mostly feeling exasperated, \"it's not like that. We're not like that. No one's going to do anything to you.\" \"Of course you will,\" Arachne whispered. \"You and your family. There's only one path for me now.\" She made a tight, tense gesture with her hand, and her avatar winked out of the blank 'bubble. The girl was hysterical as well as a liar. And yet -- no. No. Minerva would not think about it any more. There was no substance to it. She made the same gesture and exited the simweb. * \"And Mom's been on an island kick lately,\" Diana said, gesturing in a grandiose way with a forkful of scallops. \"I think it started out as an excuse to have tropical vacations, but she's really doing some interesting things with designing islands and the oceans around them. It's mostly lower-level architectural coding she does, you know, but you might look at some of her designs, they might give you ideas for upper-level sims --\" \"Diana?\" interrupted Minerva, picking wanly at the oysters. \"Mm?\" Diana took a dainty bite. \"Does the name Niobe Tantalus mean anything to you?\" Diana yawned. \"The Tantalus woman, sure, didn't I tell you about her? She was trying to start her own version of the simweb, the silly bitch. A small-scale effort, but still, not something we were going to turn a blind eye to. And then she insulted m'mother into the bargain - insinuated she was a better code-architecture creator. As if! She's produced more diverse architecture than Mom, sure, but that's because Mom's more meticulous.\" Mocking my family. Thinking you're better than I am. Minerva felt a dreadful disquiet. \"What happened?\" she asked, knowing that Diana wanted her to ask. \"I told Apollo, and he was as angry as I was.\" This was not a surprise. Diana and her twin always thought the same about everything. \"Between the two of us, we crushed her and her entire family. Apollo went after her with patent infringement - she and her sons won't be out of litigation for years, they're already bankrupt. And then she had the gall to denounce us for that in court. She stood up in the witness stand and yelled that we were bullies, that she would come back and show us - \" Diana regarded Minerva intently, then laughed her careless laugh. \"Well, you're family now, so I might as well tell you.\" She leaned forward; her voice came out as a whisper. \"I sicced Alecto on her.\" Diana sat back with a smile, clearly conscious of having produced an effect. Minerva thought back to the Alecto virus testing results she'd seen at the exec meeting, the rapid code destruction the virus produced. Niobe Tantalus would never recover from that. She had lost everything. And Diana was very good at what she did. There was no way it would be traced back to her. Niobe would know, of course, from whence her ruin had come, and the Olympians would know, but no one would ever be able to prove a thing. Diana gave her a pleased grin. Minerva felt sick. \"But enough about me. Have you talked to any developers, like Venus suggested?\" \"I have,\" Minerva said carefully. \"A couple of them. Venus was --\" as much as she hated to admit it -- \"right, it seems. The volume of chat in the external-developer communities has risen by an order of magnitude, correlated very closely with my breaking of their protobubble seals.\" She hesitated. \"No really impressive work has come out of it, though, so I'm unsure of the long-term effects.\" Diana shrugged. \"That's only to be expected; the great stuff doesn't come through every day.\" At this unexpected lack of judgment, Minerva let out a breath she hadn't been conscious she was holding. Diana continued, meditatively, \"Now Niobe, that woman, she was good, if not as good as she thought she was. It's too bad she was obnoxious about it. She should have come to work for us. I don't understand why people insist on crossing us. They must know the consequences, by this time.\" Minerva looked at Diana. She thought about Alecto. She thought about Arachne's face. \"I have to -- I'll be right back,\" Minerva managed to get out, and all but ran to the restroom, where she closed herself in a stall, taking deep breaths. She shivered. She tried not to think of Niobe, or of Arachne, or of Antiope. When she came out of the stall, Diana was at the sink, critically applying another layer of lipstick. Minerva said nothing to her. She washed her hands and splashed water on her face. Diana gave her reflection a satisfied glance and popped the lipstick back in her purse. Minerva looked at the two of them in the mirror. A small catlike smile was playing over Diana' lips, in contrast to Minerva's serious look. It was clear that they were related; Minerva's grey eyes and light hair were a more muted version of Diana' bright blue eyes and golden tresses, but the cast of their face was the same. They both had their father's high cheekbones, his strong chin. Diana, watching her watching them both, laid her head on Minerva's shoulder in a rare display of affection. \"We're just the same, you and I,\" she said, smiling secretively at the mirror. Minerva could not repress a shudder. * \"Compose message for Arachne,\" she said, once she was finally alone inside her protobubble. \"User not available,\" the pleasant voice answered her. \"This user has been permanently canceled.\" There was one thing alone that could trigger the permanent cancellation: if the system had detected a public death notice of the user. \"Oh,\" she said. \"No, no, no -\" But Arachne was such a good developer - she could have figured out how to hack into the computers. Maybe she had faked her death, maybe she had triggered the system with a false death certificate. She could have. For a minute, Minerva allowed herself to believe it. But she knew, even before she spoke the words to confirm the pictures of Arachne's body hanging from the rafters, that it was not the truth. She told the system to get rid of the picture. It did. This was a way I could make her life mean something -- She made a gesture with her fingers. \"Restore Arachne protobubble from last-known backup, authorization Minerva Fulgens.\" As simply as that, she was back in the ruins. The spiders skittered around Minerva's feet. One of them paused, watched her warily. And she spoke again: \"Break protobubble seal.\" The walls of the protobubble vanished. The wide vistas of simspace opened up. Buildings, cities, farmland; mountains, ocean, plains; everything in the world and beyond was simulated out there somewhere. Spiders came crawling out of the vines, hundreds and thousands of the small grey creatures, as if they had been called. She supposed they were probably programmed to respond to exactly this situation. They flowed past her in the ground and in the air, many borne aloft on gossamer threads, though it was only in her imagination that the silken strands brushed her cheek. With a great rushing sound, a whisper magnified a thousand times into a reverberation like that of the sea, they swept past her where she stood at the boundary between where the bubble had been and the rest of simspace. And then they were past, leaving her alone. She watched the swarm of spiders scatter until she could not see any of them anymore. Now that the seal was broken, the Olympians would never be able to find them all, not without tearing down all the code of the entire shared-world system. Tomorrow, she knew with a cold clarity, she would regret what she had just done. She would go back to her life, to her sister, her father, her family; to the board meetings and her vice-president's desk; and she would try to forget any of this ever happened. But as she had told Arachne, Arachne's work would propagate until there was a bit of the code, a spider or two, in every simworld there was. Each spider would take with it the truth, and each shining web it wove would carry Arachne's message, until the whole world knew it.",

      "Minerva nodded sagely.",
      "She'd come across the type before, the sort who wanted fame over fortune, the kind of coder who was obsessed with having her name known across the simweb.",
      "\"Ah, so you'll be wanting a little advertisement.",
      "If you have a nice little code snippet -- something small, mobile, that people will find interesting, that can be widely disseminated -- that'll do the trick for advertising.",

      "Minerva raised an eyebrow.",
      "As she did so, a small spider came ambling into view on a branch.",
      "As Minerva watched, fascinated, the spider wove an iridescent web, with a hypnotic pattern that shifted fluidly even as Minerva bent to examine it.",
      "\"Well,\" Minerva said, gesturing at the spider, \"that's your killer code snippet right there.",
      "And I assume it self-propagates?\"",

      "Then by means unknown they managed to annihilate all seven modules of Niobe's code --\" Minerva was so angry she couldn't say anything.",

      "\"Does the name Niobe Tantalus mean anything to you?\" Diana yawned.",
      "\"The Tantalus woman, sure, didn't I tell you about her?",
      "She was trying to start her own version of the simweb, the silly bitch.",
      "A small-scale effort, but still, not something we were going to turn a blind eye to.",
      "And then she insulted m'mother into the bargain - insinuated she was a better code-architecture creator.",
      "As if!",
      "She's produced more diverse architecture than Mom, sure, but that's because Mom's more meticulous.\"",
      "Mocking my family.",

      "\"I told Apollo, and he was as angry as I was.\"",
      "This was not a surprise.",
      "Diana and her twin always thought the same about everything.",
      "\"Between the two of us, we crushed her and her entire family.",
      "Apollo went after her with patent infringement - she and her sons won't be out of litigation for years, they're already bankrupt.",
      "And then she had the gall to denounce us for that in court.",
      "She stood up in the witness stand and yelled that we were bullies, that she would come back and show us - \" Diana regarded Minerva intently, then laughed her careless laugh.",
      "\"Well, you're family now, so I might as well tell you.\"",

      "\"I sicced Alecto on her.\"",
      "Diana sat back with a smile, clearly conscious of having produced an effect.",
      "Minerva thought back to the Alecto virus testing results she'd seen at the exec meeting, the rapid code destruction the virus produced.",
      "Niobe Tantalus would never recover from that.",
      "She had lost everything.",
      "And Diana was very good at what she did.",
      "There was no way it would be traced back to her.",
      "Niobe would know, of course, from whence her ruin had come, and the Olympians would know, but no one would ever be able to prove a thing.",
      "Diana gave her a pleased grin.",
      "Minerva felt sick.",
      "\"But enough about me.",
      "Have you talked to any developers, like Venus suggested?\"",
      "\"I have,\" Minerva said carefully.",

      "The volume of chat in the external-developer communities has risen by an order of magnitude, correlated very closely with my breaking of their protobubble seals.\"",
      "She hesitated.",
      "\"No really impressive work has come out of it, though, so I'm unsure of the long-term effects.\"",
      "Diana shrugged.",
      "\"That's only to be expected; the great stuff doesn't come through every day.\"",
      "At this unexpected lack of judgment, Minerva let out a breath she hadn't been conscious she was holding.",
      "Diana continued, meditatively, \"Now Niobe, that woman, she was good, if not as good as she thought she was.",
      "It's too bad she was obnoxious about it.",

      "I don't understand why people insist on crossing us.",
      "They must know the consequences, by this time.\"",
      "Minerva looked at Diana.",
      "She thought about Alecto.",
      "She thought about Arachne's face.",
      "\"I have to -- I'll be right back,\" Minerva managed to get out, and all but ran to the restroom, where she closed herself in a stall, taking deep breaths.",
      "She shivered.",
      "She tried not to think of Niobe, or of Arachne, or of Antiope.",
      "When she came out of the stall, Diana was at the sink, critically applying another layer of lipstick.",
      "Minerva said nothing to her.",
      "She washed her hands and splashed water on her face.",
      "Diana gave her reflection a satisfied glance and popped the lipstick back in her purse.",
      "Minerva looked at the two of them in the mirror.",
      "A small catlike smile was playing over Diana' lips, in contrast to Minerva's serious look.",
      "It was clear that they were related; Minerva's grey eyes and light hair were a more muted version of Diana' bright blue eyes and golden tresses, but the cast of their face was the same.",
      "They both had their father's high cheekbones, his strong chin.",
      "Diana, watching her watching them both, laid her head on Minerva's shoulder in a rare display of affection.",
      "\"We're just the same, you and I,\" she said, smiling secretively at the mirror.",

      "\"This user has been permanently canceled.\"",
      "There was one thing alone that could trigger the permanent cancellation: if the system had detected a public death notice of the user.",
      "\"Oh,\" she said.",
      "\"No, no, no -\" But Arachne was such a good developer - she could have figured out how to hack into the computers.",
      "Maybe she had faked her death, maybe she had triggered the system with a false death certificate.",
      "She could have.",
      "For a minute, Minerva allowed herself to believe it.",
      "But she knew, even before she spoke the words to confirm the pictures of Arachne's body hanging from the rafters, that it was not the truth.",
      "She told the system to get rid of the picture.",
      "It did.",
      "This was a way I could make her life mean something --",
      "She made a gesture with her fingers.",

      "As simply as that, she was back in the ruins.",
      "The spiders skittered around Minerva's feet.",
      "One of them paused, watched her warily.",
      "And she spoke again: \"Break protobubble seal.\"",
      "The walls of the protobubble vanished.",
      "The wide vistas of simspace opened up.",
      "Buildings, cities, farmland; mountains, ocean, plains; everything in the world and beyond was simulated out there somewhere.",
      "Spiders came crawling out of the vines, hundreds and thousands of the small grey creatures, as if they had been called.",
      "She supposed they were probably programmed to respond to exactly this situation.",
      "They flowed past her in the ground and in the air, many borne aloft on gossamer threads, though it was only in her imagination that the silken strands brushed her cheek.",
      "With a great rushing sound, a whisper magnified a thousand times into a reverberation like that of the sea, they swept past her where she stood at the boundary between where the bubble had been and the rest of simspace.",
      "And then they were past, leaving her alone.",
      "She watched the swarm of spiders scatter until she could not see any of them anymore.",
      "Now that the seal was broken, the Olympians would never be able to find them all, not without tearing down all the code of the entire shared-world system.",
      "Tomorrow, she knew with a cold clarity, she would regret what she had just done.",
      "She would go back to her life, to her sister, her father, her family; to the board meetings and her vice-president's desk; and she would try to forget any of this ever happened.",
      "But as she had told Arachne, Arachne's work would propagate until there was a bit of the code, a spider or two, in every simworld there was.",
      "Each spider would take with it the truth, and each shining web it wove would carry Arachne's message, until the whole world knew it."

    "text": "The road upward is steep. She is light at first, still drifting along, her hand a ghost-light touch against his hand. She feels half-asleep, wrapped in a comfortable drowsiness. There is nothing to think about and nothing to decide, only a familiar hand in hers that leads her on and the varying details of rock and earth that surround them. Something is changing; she tries to push it away but it will not go. The return of awareness is slow but inexorable, like bubbles rising to the surface of the water. She is - she is, and she remembers being. It is a shock, not entirely pleasant. She remembers who she is, and this man with her, who leads her without looking back - but he was told he must not, or the boon would be revoked. She remembers that as well. As they walk, she begins to feel the weight of her body returning. She stumbles, already grown unaccustomed to the physical world in her brief time as a shade. He starts to turn in order to catch her, stops himself. He waits until she regains her balance, and then they go on. Bones are so heavy. She had forgotten. They seem to drag her down to the earth. Only a little while ago she rested here, safely hidden in the cool silence and darkness; but now the ground seems to strike against her feet with every step, as if pushing her away. She continues somehow, putting one foot in front of the other. The return of muscles and nerves and flesh is the return of pain. It had hurt to die, as the poison coursed through her veins. She did not know it would hurt so much to come back to life. She touches her face to see if she is weeping. She is surprised to feel the smooth skin under her fingers, and to feel the touch of her own hand on her face. Eyelids, eyebrows, eyelashes - she blinks to find them all there. Her skin is a fragile barrier between herself and the outside world. When she was a shade, she drifted upon the air and was part of it; the air moved through her. Now, it stops when it touches her. She does not know whether it is better this way or not. She takes a breath, the first since she died, and she is breathing now, and the air burns like fire in her lungs. She wants to cry out, but she still does not have her own voice back. She shudders, and her heart beats faster - when did it start again, this invisible drumbeat in her flesh? But now it will be with her for ever and ever, never stopping until the day she dies again, and there will be no more peaceful silence. Bones, flesh, skin, breath, heartbeat - all returned, and so she must be a living woman. The hand touching her face must be hers, since it moves at her command, and the skin it touches is hers, since she can feel her fingers press it. But something is not quite right. She rests uneasily in her new flesh, as in an ill-fitting garment. A doubt begins to grow within her. Is this because she is not yet fully back in the land of the living? Will she recover, will everything feel as it did before? Or will she walk all her days wearing a body that is almost but not quite hers, that does not seem fully attached to her spirit? What had they promised, the dark King of Hades and his pale Queen? She wishes she could know. But when they granted his prayer, immortal gods deigning to hear a mortal, she was not present. Had they tricked him, in anger at his presumption? Did they mean to cheat their suppliant with half a bride, and her with a half-shadow existence? She tries to remember their faces. The memory is fading already, shifting and wavering like reflections in the stream. But she thinks she remembers seeing pity in the Queen's eyes, and that is most frightening of all. Perhaps they have given him (and her) as much as they could. What if even the gods do not have the power to restore life to the dead? She wishes then she could ask her husband to wait. Let him give her time, at least. It is not easy, being brought on such a journey while her senses are still dazed and drowsy, when she is still used to bodiless drifting. She wishes she could see his face, to learn what this means to him, this bringing her back to the light. But there is only his hand against hers, the movement of the muscles in his back as he walks, his hair close-cropped in mourning. The air around them is not quite so chill, and the quality of the light is changing. She did not remember sunlight, but now she recognizes that different light reaching into the shadows of the cave. And if she once goes fully into that warm earthly light, it will be too late; too late to weigh the bargain, too late to recall the god's boon, too late for choice. She remembers now, when she was brought to where her husband stood before the King and Queen of the Underworld, when they placed her hand in his; the King spoke to him then in a voice like the dark places of the earth. Remember well: if you turn back to look at her before you reach the upper world, she will return to the shades forever and nothing can recall her. But the Queen had looked at her, looked with pity, her eyes young and ancient at once. And would the Maiden not know what it was like, to be returned from death to life? The condition, spoken again when she was present - was it a warning for her husband, or for her? Her husband has seen the daylight also, and his step quickens. She tugs on his hand. He does not heed her, but she leans backward with the weight of her new body until he has to stop. He grips her hand tightly. She can read a volume of arguments in the tense set of his shoulders. If she could speak, would he listen? Could he understand things for which there are no words in mortal language? Can he understand, that to draw her out from the shadow of death is not to set her free of it, that she will never be free? One hand is caught in his, but she reaches out with the other to cup his chin, as she had on their wedding night, and she turns his face around to look at her. She has one moment to meet his gaze, one moment to tell him with her eyes what she is forbidden to say in words, before the heavy weight of her body falls away again and her shade flutters free, back to rest and stillness.",

      "Remember well: if you turn back to look at her before you reach the upper world, she will return to the shades forever and nothing can recall her.",
      "But the Queen had looked at her, looked with pity, her eyes young and ancient at once.",
      "And would the Maiden not know what it was like, to be returned from death to life?",
      "The condition, spoken again when she was present - was it a warning for her husband, or for her?",
      "Her husband has seen the daylight also, and his step quickens.",
      "She tugs on his hand.",
      "He does not heed her, but she leans backward with the weight of her new body until he has to stop.",
      "He grips her hand tightly.",
      "She can read a volume of arguments in the tense set of his shoulders.",
      "If she could speak, would he listen?",
      "Could he understand things for which there are no words in mortal language?",
      "Can he understand, that to draw her out from the shadow of death is not to set her free of it, that she will never be free?",
      "One hand is caught in his, but she reaches out with the other to cup his chin, as she had on their wedding night, and she turns his face around to look at her.",
      "She has one moment to meet his gaze, one moment to tell him with her eyes what she is forbidden to say in words, before the heavy weight of her body falls away again and her shade flutters free, back to rest and stillness."

    "text": "The day she sees the ship with the black sails arrive, Ariadne is wearing red. She glances down upon the soft fabric of her jacket, the ruffles of her skirt lined with blues, and then back at the dark dot getting closer and closer. * The old woman's hands are wrinkled and stained and warm. She cups soil in one of them, and uses a thin finger to push it around until a seed comes up. \"Do you know what this is going to be?\" She asks. It's going to grow, Ariadne knows. It's going to grow and sprout branches and leaves and blossoms. The priestess looks at her with fond eyes, as if she knows what she's thinking, and Ariadne looks up solemnly. \"The seed will grow, yes\", the woman says. \"It is going to survive. The Earth is going to hold it inside her and feed it and take care of it, and then it's going to poke out and grow, and blossom its way to fullness.\" Ariadne pokes one of her thumbs in the soil in her own small cupped hands, until she brings another seed out. \"But more than that\", the woman goes on, \"you yourself are like a seed. Your mother held you like the soil will hold these, but now you're out, and you're going to blossom, too, and grow. But you mother is not the only mother you have; the Earth is the other one. The seed is like you. It's like me; like your sister and your friend and the girls in the temples in their green skirts. We all come from the ground, and grow like the trees do. We all go back into it. Earth bore us, earth gave birth to us, earth feeds us and holds us and earth is going to cradle us in our old age. She's one, and she's in you, and in me, and in everything, and that's why we take care of her and celebrate her and honour her with our existence and our actions.\" Ariadne presses her hands together, and then separates them. The seed is protected again, safe inside the soil. She rests her hands on her bent knees, and looks around from where she is sitting low on the ground. The world around her shines. * Ariadne has two brothers and a sister: She doesn't see her oldest brother a lot. His hair is dark, and long, like hers, and his face is bright with smiling eyes. He fights with the bulls every year, and practices at swordplay and fighting and running, and sometimes picks flowers for her and Phaedra, and holds their hands when they take walks in the central market. Her sister is a little older than her, and they've been the same height since they were very small. Her hair is a warmer colour than Ariadne's, rich and reddish, like wood or the columns of the palace. She gets angry easily, like their dad, but then she recovers quickly, quite unlike him. Her eyes look smart, Ariadne thinks, and her hands are soft. Her other brother is strange: his skin is brown, like her own, and he has large-knuckled fingers. His head is that of a calf, and he can't speak like they do, but he makes sounds and his siblings understand. Asterion, they call him, and his eyes shine like stars. They make him flower crowns, stark against the dark hair and his tiny round horns, and he falls back on the grass, mooing happily. * Green are the trees, colourful their blossoms, brown is their skin and the ground they walk on; there's red on the flowers, on the palace walls, on her father's robes. Blue is the sky, and the sea. Ariadne counts the colours of the fruit in the market: yellow bananas from the south, oranges and citruses in the colours of the sunset, olives dark like her hair and lighter ones, like her skin, and greenish ones, like old tree leaves. Bright flowers, fat cows, ornamental swords with flowers sculpted on their handles, fish, so many shiny fish, and white hens and honey and honey coloured octopuses hung from strings to dry. People smile down at her. She only reaches their waists but they bend down to offer her flowers, dark juicy berries, a warm piece of cheesy bread. She says thank you, and please, and the warm faces around her and Androgeus, with his kind eyes and his strong arms, make her feel full and swollen with pleasure. * Icarus has deft hands: he can write as well as a scribe even though he's not much older than Ariadne, and paint, and make small toys out of scraps he finds in his father's workplace. Icarus is a great friend, to Ariadne's mind. He can fix their broken toys, and he knows lots of stories, and he is brave and curious. They save fruit from their meals and when they meet, they climb up on the roofs and eat them greedily with their feet dangling off the edge, watching the sunset. Then they jump from roof to roof, and run on the vast flat levels, and learn how to race silently because neither of their fathers would be pleased to find them there. * Ariadne doesn't have brothers anymore: one of them dies. He's killed, they say, by the boar that was roaming Attica; he was killed, their father screams, by those vile Athenians. The other one is a monster now; he grows too fast, and he's bigger, much bigger than her, his horns threatening, and when she learns what they use him for she has nightmares for weeks. Phaedra lets her slip in her bed and holds her cold hands, pushes Ariadne's feet between hers and rubs them to warmth. Ariadne still has a sister. * Her father is in a constant state of rage these days. She doesn't know if it's so much grief over his son's death, his beautiful, kind son, or anger over the Athenians' disrespect of his authority. * The Athenians are crushed, in the end. Their punishment, decided at court, by king and council both, is the worst that could be. Icarus' dad walks around with eyes even darker, eyebrows drawn down, heavy shoulders. Ariadne feels sorry for him, but truth be told, she doesn't know who to pity first these days. Icarus shrugs, but she can see his face is clouded, too, and feels guilty. She crouches down and empties her stomach, shaking violently. Her body feels better, but her soul doesn't. * The market is still rich in fruit; there's still plenty of ships going in and out of the port every day. They still have imported monkeys, and large white shells that will produce deep coloured dyes, and merchants that come streaming in the courtyard. It just seems less all in all, and colder. In between her mother's silences and her father's fits, Ariadne grows like a seed. Longer hair, longer limbs, a strong chin and arcing eyebrows. The holy women in the temple think her good enough and trust her, and where Ariadne would laugh and shout when she was younger, she smiles politely and strives to fight the absence of feeling in her chest. * \"The seed is like you; it's like me, and your mother, your sister and your brothers, your friend, the guards, the priestesses, the sellers and the merchants. Earth bore us and it gave birth to us and it feeds us and protects us. You are no more than me. I am no more than the king, the queen, no more than the servants and the sellers. Earth is in all of us, and we are all her children. Take care of everyone as you would of your siblings, because your siblings they are.\" Ariadne holds on to the image of the wise wrinkled face in her head, of the dots of sunlight between the tree leaves, of the rocks and soil under her feet. She holds on to the words like a lost person in the sea holds on to a wrecked mast. She swears to herself, and to the Earth below. She is not sure what it is she promises, but she will figure it out and then she will do it. * \"I need you to do something\", Minos tells her one day when the throne room is empty. Ariadne is fifteen, her skirts adorned with the signs of a priestess in training. She turns to him curiously. He's leaning forward on his throne, his eyes strict as always, chin supported on his hand. \"There are guards in the labyrinth, as you know, but every man in this land is afraid of the one inside it.\" \"Do you want me to take care of Asterion?\", she asks, her words weighting on the use of her brother's given name. \"I want you to be responsible for the labyrinth. See to your brother's needs. You'll be a priestess soon. You will have to cleanse the place, perform the ceremonies, organize the guard.\" Ariadne nods. She knows she can't refuse, but she doesn't want to anyway. \"Of course, father\", she says bowing her head. Behind her lashes, she can see Minos's tension lift momentarily from his face. She looks back down. * Icarus hands her a ball of yarn. \"My dad said you'll be needing this\", he says. Daedalus should hate her. Icarus should hate her, too, but neither of them seems to and it makes Ariadne want to cry. She visits Asterion every day; she talks to him, has at least one meal with him, makes him flower crowns. He's huge now, with the head of a full-grown bull. His eyes are sad, constantly sad to her, and she wonders if she sees what she wants to see, because he's a monster but still her brother. Every time, when she has to leave, he walks with her to the corridor behind the entrance. Then he walks away and Ariadne comes out alone, the guards turning to greet with respect and a dash of admiration. * The ship from Athens arrives at sunset, black sails against the sky's oranges and pinks. The Athenian kids, a couple of them as young as twelve, form a procession towards the king. Their clothing is white, shining under the fading light. Some of them are as dark as Ariadne; others are a lighter tone of brown; some of them have hair the colour of wheat and rosy skin. They're all scared, and all proud. The first one on the line especially, with his dark hair and eyebrows and his well-corded shoulders. He doesn't kneel when he reaches Minos. There is no exchange of pleasantries. The dark-haired man is Theseus, the Athenian prince. Ariadne is surprised a king would allow his son to be brought as a lamb to the knife, but then maybe this is all for the best. Theseus is about her own age, with a sturdy built and arms thick with muscle. The king makes them kneel in the end, even the prince, who looks at him from under his eyebrows with seething eyes. Easy there, thinks Ariadne. You're being obvious. * After the Athenians have been sealed inside their cells, and the ceremonies have finished, they have dinner. Ariadne expects to feel excited, or nervous at least, but her hands are steady and her body warm. She pushes all thoughts to the back of her head for the hour they stay in the dining room, focuses on the white faces of the women painted on the walls, and chews her food carefully. If her mother looks at her curiously once, she pretends not to notice. Later still, she visits the prison with Minos. The guards bow their head in respect to both her and her father. He doesn't do more than throw a glance in every cell to make sure the boys and girls are still safely inside. He doesn't even talk to Theseus, doesn't bother with threats or intimidations. He walks past him, and then climbs up the stairs at the end of the corridor. The guards follow him. She waits until she can no longer hear him, and stands before Theseus' cell. He notices her immediately and in the dim light she catches curiousness and wonder in his eyes, before he averts them. \"There's a reason I'm here, but I'd like you to look at me first.\" His head shots up, taken by surprise. \"I want to help you, yes, and I need you to be really quiet. Just nod, please.\" The line of his eyebrows is strong and dark, making his eyes look strict, or wild, but now he just looks surprised. \"If you have looked\", she goes on, \"you will know that there is a sword under your beddings.\" He nods, so he must have looked. \"It's a good sword\", she adds hopefully. He has stopped crouching by then, pulling up to his feet to stand opposite her, but not too close. \"I know you can kill the Minotaur, but you also need a way to get out of the labyrinth. That's why you're going to be needing this.\" She kneels, and unties the large knot that had been sitting under her skirt for hours, and pulls it out for him to see. \"You're going to tie or pin the one end near the door. Then, you are going to hold the ball and walk into the labyrinth. Whichever way you go, it will lead you to him. As the yarn unfolds, it will mark your way, and when you're done, you're going to follow it back to the beginning. There will be no guards and you will be able to leave.\" He is watching her closely, by now. His eyes only flicker to her bare chest momentarily, and then shift, as an unuttered apology. She finds his face looks youthful and determined, but also vaguely confused. He finally chooses to speak. \"Why--why are you doing this?\", he whispers. \"Because nobody else can and someone must. And because I chose to.\" Theseus' eyes gleam in the dark, fixed on her face. \"There's something more\", she says. \"I will need you to take me with you on your journey home.\" She sees his expression change into something shocked and maybe a little repulsed. Her lips tighten. \"I am going to need to talk to your father and negotiate. What we've done is unforgivable, but I hope I can change the misery of both my people and yours.\" \"Also\", she adds, \"my king won't be thrilled that I helped you.\" * (A few hours earlier, she'd made the last flower crown she'd ever make for Asterion and placed it on his head. She doesn't pretend it's for his own good and guilt sticks at her throat, pulls at her chest, makes her mouth bitter. She repeats to herself, you're saving the children. She repeats, this needs to stop. And she repeats: Minos is only using him to enforce his authority, and this authority must be wrecked, pulled down and destroyed. Asterion's eyes remain sad, and a corridor before the exit, Ariadne clasps his hands tightly, tears in her eyes.) * She's waiting in the shadows of the dock, wearing sober, plain clothes, with numerous folds instead of ruffles, and a covered bosom. It's maybe an hour after dawn when Theseus and the Athenian kids arrive, holding onto each other, Theseus with a sword dripping dark blood (her brother's blood. Ariadne pushes the thought away). He has half a mind to help her up on a ship, where the captain spares her a curious glance amidst the chaos. It's a quick ship, she had observed while she waited. They knew what they were doing. They leave, and Ariadne focuses hard on not looking back. * A few days later, she finds herself wondering in the woods in Naxos. The skirt of her dress is dirty, muddy around her ankles, and her sandals are made for a palace and a court, not rocks and weeds. Savages, savages. That's what they are to the Grecian, savages, simple-minded and blood-thirsty. Have they not seen the markets in Zakros? The wall paintings in Knossos? How can they judge her like this when they'd be goners without her, lost endlessly in the labyrinth's meanders, even with Asterion dead? She pulls at her skirt as she walks, her curls bouncing around her shoulders, scratching at one of her arms with the other hand. She was not their guest; it's a prisoner they saw her as, Minos' second-born daughter, a priestess of their silly religion, oh, what better a trophy than a princess and a holy woman? No, not a prisoner, because no, they didn't object to her running away, merely looked at her in disgust, even though she was wearing clothes like their own and spoke their language instead of hers. She pushes branches out of her way now, the sun burning the back of her neck, her head, her arm spread out in front of her. She has no idea what she's going to do, but she goes on, on, until she burrows where the sun in gentler on her, ribbons of it on her arms and the ground. Exhaustion sits on her shoulders, inside her ribcage, and pushes her to the ground. Ariadne wraps her arms around her knees and sleeps. * She wakes in the night, not from the cold, but from a cheerful piping music somewhere close. She stretches back, rolls her shoulders, digs her fingers on the base of her nape. There's a light dancing around, somewhere not very far, and as she watches it, the music comes closer, and closer, until a mismatched company appears through the trees. There are goat-men, and dancing goat-children with round cheeks, and women with tangled, wild hair playing drums and bouncing on their steps. In the end of the line, there's a man, curly hair adorned with flowers and vine leaves, a drinking cup on his hand that he uses to sprinkle wine upon the ground and his company. Some of the kids pass by her, but the women look at her curiously, and the man spreads a commanding hand to stop them on their step. Ariadne is still tired, and confused, but she doesn't like the way the man looks at her, or the way he pronounces himself a god, or the way he asks her to follow him. \"But you're left here\", he says, \"my little Cretan mare, how could you have hope to go anywhere else? You're abandoned, so why should you not follow us and turn your sorrow into celebration? I am a god, a god of happiness and joy, and why would you not want to be my wife?\" Ariadne is not used to marriage proposals in the deep of night. \"You're not my god\", she says; \"I'm not from here, and I have not heard you before. I'd rather go my way, if you don't mind.\" His eyes sadden, for a moment, but then become threatening, and he spreads his hand to finger at one of her curls. But such a beauty, he insists. She refuses, arms crossed, brow tense. The man tips his head to the side, observing her. There is no way she got all the way to Naxos to be abducted by a god. No, she says for the last time, firmly, feet planted in the ground. She feels all the eyes in this part of the forest on her. Then, one of the women in the company, her hair loose except for a few curls braided with ribbons of flowers, pokes at the god (he really is a god, it can be seen in his eyes and his hands and the whole of him, Ariadne realizes) with a wooden stick covered with vines. Her eyes, so joyful before, are stern now. The god shrugs one shoulder and raises his hand dismissively. The company begins to move away, Ariadne left behind to look at them, confused and tired. The woman with the braids turns around as they leave and winks at her. Ariadne can't help but smile back. * The floor is warm. Ariadne wiggles her toes against the warmth, breathes deeply. She presses her palms on the ground. Phaedra is using one of her ivory combs to untangle the ends of her sister's hair, careful not to pull painfully at them. They are alone in this end of the great court. \"Phaedra?\" \"Hmm?\" \"You know you are going to be queen, don't you?\" Phaedra huffs. \"It's not right to speak of this.\" Ariadne looks down, the corners of her mouth pressed in. \"But you are going to be, Phaedra. We shouldn't be scared to talk about this.\" \"All right. All right. No, it's not. It's, it's simply that it feels pervasive.\" Ariadne quietens. \"I can't be queen alone, Ariadne\", Phaedra says a few moments later. Ariadne hums in agreement. \"I don't want to be like father\", her sister says, voice small. \"You'll have me\", Ariadne offers, half-turning her head. \"You shouldn't be like father\", she adds a breath later. \"Nobody should.\" Phaedra is running her fingers through her hair now, spreading the curls on her back. Ariadne turns around and takes the comb in hand, like they did years ago when they were children. Phaedra turns her back to her, untangling the pins from her hair and letting it all fall on her back. \"We need to do something\", Ariadne says quietly. It's something she's only now mustering the courage to say. Phaedra nods. * Ariadne arrives in Crete two weeks later. Naxos was easy to navigate, and she only had to find a priestess to ensure food and safety. The Cyclades were allies to the Cretans, with bonds more than just commercial: old beliefs and rituals connected them, and once Ariadne met the great priestess of the island, the recognition was immediate. She had to wait for the next scheduled ship to Crete, a slim, easy moving commercial ship with vines painted at its side. In the end, she finds herself eager to return home. The sun blinding her, she climbs down the ship, and blesses everything she can think of for the ground beneath her feet. Without care for the crowd in the port, she kneels down and kisses the soil of her home. Once her head and her gaze are clearer, she can see all eyes stuck on her; she can count the varying emotions. She can feel intense hatred, and she can feel admiration, and she can feel love, and confusion, of course, and then, expectance. She greets those who greet her, and smiles, her heart pounding in her chest. Then, she sees the priestesses. It's like a committee of them, distinct clothes and hair, and bright, bright faces when they see her, and smiles like they're sharing a secret. They clasp her hands and hug her and eagerly lead her to the eldest one, the great priestess who's taught her almost everything she knows. \"You did right, child\", she says after welcoming her back. \"But it's not a finished job and it will probably be a long time before you can say you're even remotely done.\" She nods, unnerved. It's Phaedra she sees next. They all walk to the palace together from one of the side roads; it will be some time before she can show herself at court, so they take the way that leads directly to hers and Phaedra's rooms. And Phaedra, oh Phaedra, she cries when she sees her and Ariadne finds herself crying too, tears spilling and hands clenching on her sister's back as she hugs her. Phaedra had said, you can't do this, you absolutely can't, father will kill you; she'd hugged her before she left and wished her a good luck; but Phaedra had also told her, I know you can do this and I know it's your choice and I will help you, and so she did. They had talked about this before she'd left, lying in Phaedra's beddings at night: you're a priestess, Phaedra'd said, father can't shun you because you're under the great priestess' protection. And the great priestess, who had opposed the king's decision to punish Athens, offered Ariadne help and safety and her own power to their cause. She regards them both from head to toe now; she's known them since they were babies and now here are trying to oppose their father's authority. This won't be easy, she tells them, but it can work. \"We'll make it work\", Ariadne says, stern, and Phaedra chuckles. She ushers them all in an inner room, shadowy but comfortable, and they fill Ariadne in with what she doesn't know, but had predicted: Minos' rage, his threats, the council's worries, the people's mixed reactions. Nothing they can't work with. Phaedra is Minos' only heiress, so she will have to gain power inside the council; Ariadne, as a holy woman, has different access to the people. A lot of them almost worship her already; the girls don't doubt there will be stories of her actions for a long time and she doesn't know how to feel about this, but she knows she'll have to use it to her advantage. It's a thing she can't quite wrap her mind around, herself such a powerful and influential person, but maybe it's for the best, because it's not herself she wants the power for. Next to her, Phaedra squeezes her hand momentarily. What a compassionate, loved queen she's going to be, Ariadne thinks. Opposite her, the great priestess has her face turned to the only window, and the sun paints her face golden, gleams on her earrings. The old woman is plotting with a sneaky, delighted smirk, and if Ariadne is going to be a woman of power, she wants to do it with as much joy as the priestess does. In a room full of deceitfully giggly girls, Ariadne finds herself not only decisive, but also hopeful.",

      "Her eyes look smart, Ariadne thinks, and her hands are soft.",
      "Her other brother is strange: his skin is brown, like her own, and he has large-knuckled fingers.",
      "His head is that of a calf, and he can't speak like they do, but he makes sounds and his siblings understand.",
      "Asterion, they call him, and his eyes shine like stars.",
      "They make him flower crowns, stark against the dark hair and his tiny round horns, and he falls back on the grass, mooing happily.",
      "* Green are the trees, colourful their blossoms, brown is their skin and the ground they walk on; there's red on the flowers, on the palace walls, on her father's robes.",
      "Blue is the sky, and the sea.",
      "Ariadne counts the colours of the fruit in the market: yellow bananas from the south, oranges and citruses in the colours of the sunset, olives dark like her hair and lighter ones, like her skin, and greenish ones, like old tree leaves.",
      "Bright flowers, fat cows, ornamental swords with flowers sculpted on their handles, fish, so many shiny fish, and white hens and honey and honey coloured octopuses hung from strings to dry.",
      "People smile down at her.",
      "She only reaches their waists but they bend down to offer her flowers, dark juicy berries, a warm piece of cheesy bread.",
      "She says thank you, and please, and the warm faces around her and Androgeus, with his kind eyes and his strong arms, make her feel full and swollen with pleasure.",
      "* Icarus has deft hands: he can write as well as a scribe even though he's not much older than Ariadne, and paint, and make small toys out of scraps he finds in his father's workplace.",
      "Icarus is a great friend, to Ariadne's mind.",
      "He can fix their broken toys, and he knows lots of stories, and he is brave and curious.",
      "They save fruit from their meals and when they meet, they climb up on the roofs and eat them greedily with their feet dangling off the edge, watching the sunset.",
      "Then they jump from roof to roof, and run on the vast flat levels, and learn how to race silently because neither of their fathers would be pleased to find them there.",
      "* Ariadne doesn't have brothers anymore: one of them dies.",
      "He's killed, they say, by the boar that was roaming Attica; he was killed, their father screams, by those vile Athenians.",
      "The other one is a monster now; he grows too fast, and he's bigger, much bigger than her, his horns threatening, and when she learns what they use him for she has nightmares for weeks.",
      "Phaedra lets her slip in her bed and holds her cold hands, pushes Ariadne's feet between hers and rubs them to warmth.",
      "Ariadne still has a sister.",
      "* Her father is in a constant state of rage these days.",
      "She doesn't know if it's so much grief over his son's death, his beautiful, kind son, or anger over the Athenians' disrespect of his authority.",
      "* The Athenians are crushed, in the end.",
      "Their punishment, decided at court, by king and council both, is the worst that could be.",
      "Icarus' dad walks around with eyes even darker, eyebrows drawn down, heavy shoulders.",
      "Ariadne feels sorry for him, but truth be told, she doesn't know who to pity first these days.",
      "Icarus shrugs, but she can see his face is clouded, too, and feels guilty.",
      "She crouches down and empties her stomach, shaking violently.",
      "Her body feels better, but her soul doesn't.",
      "* The market is still rich in fruit; there's still plenty of ships going in and out of the port every day.",
      "They still have imported monkeys, and large white shells that will produce deep coloured dyes, and merchants that come streaming in the courtyard.",
      "It just seems less all in all, and colder.",
      "In between her mother's silences and her father's fits, Ariadne grows like a seed.",
      "Longer hair, longer limbs, a strong chin and arcing eyebrows.",
      "The holy women in the temple think her good enough and trust her, and where Ariadne would laugh and shout when she was younger, she smiles politely and strives to fight the absence of feeling in her chest.",
      "* \"The seed is like you; it's like me, and your mother, your sister and your brothers, your friend, the guards, the priestesses, the sellers and the merchants.",
      "Earth bore us and it gave birth to us and it feeds us and protects us.",
      "You are no more than me.",
      "I am no more than the king, the queen, no more than the servants and the sellers.",
      "Earth is in all of us, and we are all her children.",
      "Take care of everyone as you would of your siblings, because your siblings they are.\"",
      "Ariadne holds on to the image of the wise wrinkled face in her head, of the dots of sunlight between the tree leaves, of the rocks and soil under her feet.",
      "She holds on to the words like a lost person in the sea holds on to a wrecked mast.",
      "She swears to herself, and to the Earth below.",
      "She is not sure what it is she promises, but she will figure it out and then she will do it.",
      "* \"I need you to do something\", Minos tells her one day when the throne room is empty.",
      "Ariadne is fifteen, her skirts adorned with the signs of a priestess in training.",
      "She turns to him curiously.",
      "He's leaning forward on his throne, his eyes strict as always, chin supported on his hand.",
      "\"There are guards in the labyrinth, as you know, but every man in this land is afraid of the one inside it.\"",
      "\"Do you want me to take care of Asterion?\", she asks, her words weighting on the use of her brother's given name.",
      "\"I want you to be responsible for the labyrinth.",
      "See to your brother's needs.",
      "You'll be a priestess soon.",
      "You will have to cleanse the place, perform the ceremonies, organize the guard.\"",
      "Ariadne nods.",
      "She knows she can't refuse, but she doesn't want to anyway.",
      "\"Of course, father\", she says bowing her head.",
      "Behind her lashes, she can see Minos's tension lift momentarily from his face.",
      "She looks back down.",
      "* Icarus hands her a ball of yarn.",
      "\"My dad said you'll be needing this\", he says.",
      "Daedalus should hate her.",
      "Icarus should hate her, too, but neither of them seems to and it makes Ariadne want to cry.",
      "She visits Asterion every day; she talks to him, has at least one meal with him, makes him flower crowns.",
      "He's huge now, with the head of a full-grown bull.",
      "His eyes are sad, constantly sad to her, and she wonders if she sees what she wants to see, because he's a monster but still her brother.",
      "Every time, when she has to leave, he walks with her to the corridor behind the entrance.",
      "Then he walks away and Ariadne comes out alone, the guards turning to greet with respect and a dash of admiration.",
      "* The ship from Athens arrives at sunset, black sails against the sky's oranges and pinks.",
      "The Athenian kids, a couple of them as young as twelve, form a procession towards the king.",
      "Their clothing is white, shining under the fading light.",
      "Some of them are as dark as Ariadne; others are a lighter tone of brown; some of them have hair the colour of wheat and rosy skin.",
      "They're all scared, and all proud.",
      "The first one on the line especially, with his dark hair and eyebrows and his well-corded shoulders.",
      "He doesn't kneel when he reaches Minos.",
      "There is no exchange of pleasantries.",
      "The dark-haired man is Theseus, the Athenian prince.",
      "Ariadne is surprised a king would allow his son to be brought as a lamb to the knife, but then maybe this is all for the best.",
      "Theseus is about her own age, with a sturdy built and arms thick with muscle.",
      "The king makes them kneel in the end, even the prince, who looks at him from under his eyebrows with seething eyes.",
      "Easy there, thinks Ariadne.",
      "You're being obvious.",
      "* After the Athenians have been sealed inside their cells, and the ceremonies have finished, they have dinner.",
      "Ariadne expects to feel excited, or nervous at least, but her hands are steady and her body warm.",
      "She pushes all thoughts to the back of her head for the hour they stay in the dining room, focuses on the white faces of the women painted on the walls, and chews her food carefully.",
      "If her mother looks at her curiously once, she pretends not to notice.",
      "Later still, she visits the prison with Minos.",
      "The guards bow their head in respect to both her and her father.",
      "He doesn't do more than throw a glance in every cell to make sure the boys and girls are still safely inside.",
      "He doesn't even talk to Theseus, doesn't bother with threats or intimidations.",
      "He walks past him, and then climbs up the stairs at the end of the corridor.",
      "The guards follow him.",
      "She waits until she can no longer hear him, and stands before Theseus' cell.",
      "He notices her immediately and in the dim light she catches curiousness and wonder in his eyes, before he averts them.",
      "\"There's a reason I'm here, but I'd like you to look at me first.\"",
      "His head shots up, taken by surprise.",
      "\"I want to help you, yes, and I need you to be really quiet.",
      "Just nod, please.\"",
      "The line of his eyebrows is strong and dark, making his eyes look strict, or wild, but now he just looks surprised.",
      "\"If you have looked\", she goes on, \"you will know that there is a sword under your beddings.\"",
      "He nods, so he must have looked.",
      "\"It's a good sword\", she adds hopefully.",
      "He has stopped crouching by then, pulling up to his feet to stand opposite her, but not too close.",
      "\"I know you can kill the Minotaur, but you also need a way to get out of the labyrinth.",
      "That's why you're going to be needing this.\"",
      "She kneels, and unties the large knot that had been sitting under her skirt for hours, and pulls it out for him to see.",
      "\"You're going to tie or pin the one end near the door.",
      "Then, you are going to hold the ball and walk into the labyrinth.",
      "Whichever way you go, it will lead you to him.",
      "As the yarn unfolds, it will mark your way, and when you're done, you're going to follow it back to the beginning.",
      "There will be no guards and you will be able to leave.\"",
      "He is watching her closely, by now.",
      "His eyes only flicker to her bare chest momentarily, and then shift, as an unuttered apology.",
      "She finds his face looks youthful and determined, but also vaguely confused.",
      "He finally chooses to speak.",
      "\"Why--why are you doing this?\", he whispers.",
      "\"Because nobody else can and someone must.",
      "And because I chose to.\"",
      "Theseus' eyes gleam in the dark, fixed on her face.",
      "\"There's something more\", she says.",
      "\"I will need you to take me with you on your journey home.\"",
      "She sees his expression change into something shocked and maybe a little repulsed.",
      "Her lips tighten.",
      "\"I am going to need to talk to your father and negotiate.",
      "What we've done is unforgivable, but I hope I can change the misery of both my people and yours.\"",
      "\"Also\", she adds, \"my king won't be thrilled that I helped you.\"",
      "* (A few hours earlier, she'd made the last flower crown she'd ever make for Asterion and placed it on his head.",
      "She doesn't pretend it's for his own good and guilt sticks at her throat, pulls at her chest, makes her mouth bitter.",
      "She repeats to herself, you're saving the children.",
      "She repeats, this needs to stop.",
      "And she repeats: Minos is only using him to enforce his authority, and this authority must be wrecked, pulled down and destroyed.",
      "Asterion's eyes remain sad, and a corridor before the exit, Ariadne clasps his hands tightly, tears in her eyes.)",
      "* She's waiting in the shadows of the dock, wearing sober, plain clothes, with numerous folds instead of ruffles, and a covered bosom.",
      "It's maybe an hour after dawn when Theseus and the Athenian kids arrive, holding onto each other, Theseus with a sword dripping dark blood (her brother's blood.",
      "Ariadne pushes the thought away).",
      "He has half a mind to help her up on a ship, where the captain spares her a curious glance amidst the chaos.",
      "It's a quick ship, she had observed while she waited.",
      "They knew what they were doing.",
      "They leave, and Ariadne focuses hard on not looking back.",
      "* A few days later, she finds herself wondering in the woods in Naxos.",
      "The skirt of her dress is dirty, muddy around her ankles, and her sandals are made for a palace and a court, not rocks and weeds.",
      "Savages, savages.",
      "That's what they are to the Grecian, savages, simple-minded and blood-thirsty.",
      "Have they not seen the markets in Zakros?",
      "The wall paintings in Knossos?",
      "How can they judge her like this when they'd be goners without her, lost endlessly in the labyrinth's meanders, even with Asterion dead?",
      "She pulls at her skirt as she walks, her curls bouncing around her shoulders, scratching at one of her arms with the other hand.",
      "She was not their guest; it's a prisoner they saw her as, Minos' second-born daughter, a priestess of their silly religion, oh, what better a trophy than a princess and a holy woman?",
      "No, not a prisoner, because no, they didn't object to her running away, merely looked at her in disgust, even though she was wearing clothes like their own and spoke their language instead of hers.",
      "She pushes branches out of her way now, the sun burning the back of her neck, her head, her arm spread out in front of her.",
      "She has no idea what she's going to do, but she goes on, on, until she burrows where the sun in gentler on her, ribbons of it on her arms and the ground.",
      "Exhaustion sits on her shoulders, inside her ribcage, and pushes her to the ground.",
      "Ariadne wraps her arms around her knees and sleeps.",
      "* She wakes in the night, not from the cold, but from a cheerful piping music somewhere close.",
      "She stretches back, rolls her shoulders, digs her fingers on the base of her nape.",
      "There's a light dancing around, somewhere not very far, and as she watches it, the music comes closer, and closer, until a mismatched company appears through the trees.",
      "There are goat-men, and dancing goat-children with round cheeks, and women with tangled, wild hair playing drums and bouncing on their steps.",
      "In the end of the line, there's a man, curly hair adorned with flowers and vine leaves, a drinking cup on his hand that he uses to sprinkle wine upon the ground and his company.",
      "Some of the kids pass by her, but the women look at her curiously, and the man spreads a commanding hand to stop them on their step.",
      "Ariadne is still tired, and confused, but she doesn't like the way the man looks at her, or the way he pronounces himself a god, or the way he asks her to follow him.",
      "\"But you're left here\", he says, \"my little Cretan mare, how could you have hope to go anywhere else?",
      "You're abandoned, so why should you not follow us and turn your sorrow into celebration?",
      "I am a god, a god of happiness and joy, and why would you not want to be my wife?\" Ariadne is not used to marriage proposals in the deep of night.",
      "\"You're not my god\", she says; \"I'm not from here, and I have not heard you before.",
      "I'd rather go my way, if you don't mind.\"",
      "His eyes sadden, for a moment, but then become threatening, and he spreads his hand to finger at one of her curls.",
      "But such a beauty, he insists.",
      "She refuses, arms crossed, brow tense.",
      "The man tips his head to the side, observing her.",
      "There is no way she got all the way to Naxos to be abducted by a god.",
      "No, she says for the last time, firmly, feet planted in the ground.",
      "She feels all the eyes in this part of the forest on her.",
      "Then, one of the women in the company, her hair loose except for a few curls braided with ribbons of flowers, pokes at the god (he really is a god, it can be seen in his eyes and his hands and the whole of him, Ariadne realizes) with a wooden stick covered with vines.",
      "Her eyes, so joyful before, are stern now.",
      "The god shrugs one shoulder and raises his hand dismissively.",
      "The company begins to move away, Ariadne left behind to look at them, confused and tired.",
      "The woman with the braids turns around as they leave and winks at her.",
      "Ariadne can't help but smile back.",
      "* The floor is warm.",
      "Ariadne wiggles her toes against the warmth, breathes deeply.",
      "She presses her palms on the ground.",
      "Phaedra is using one of her ivory combs to untangle the ends of her sister's hair, careful not to pull painfully at them.",
      "They are alone in this end of the great court.",
      "\"Phaedra?\"",
      "\"Hmm?\"",
      "\"You know you are going to be queen, don't you?\" Phaedra huffs.",
      "\"It's not right to speak of this.\"",
      "Ariadne looks down, the corners of her mouth pressed in.",
      "\"But you are going to be, Phaedra.",
      "We shouldn't be scared to talk about this.\"",
      "\"All right.",
      "All right.",
      "No, it's not.",
      "It's, it's simply that it feels pervasive.\"",
      "Ariadne quietens.",
      "\"I can't be queen alone, Ariadne\", Phaedra says a few moments later.",
      "Ariadne hums in agreement.",
      "\"I don't want to be like father\", her sister says, voice small.",
      "\"You'll have me\", Ariadne offers, half-turning her head.",
      "\"You shouldn't be like father\", she adds a breath later.",
      "\"Nobody should.\"",
      "Phaedra is running her fingers through her hair now, spreading the curls on her back.",
      "Ariadne turns around and takes the comb in hand, like they did years ago when they were children.",
      "Phaedra turns her back to her, untangling the pins from her hair and letting it all fall on her back.",
      "\"We need to do something\", Ariadne says quietly.",
      "It's something she's only now mustering the courage to say.",
      "Phaedra nods.",
      "* Ariadne arrives in Crete two weeks later.",
      "Naxos was easy to navigate, and she only had to find a priestess to ensure food and safety.",
      "The Cyclades were allies to the Cretans, with bonds more than just commercial: old beliefs and rituals connected them, and once Ariadne met the great priestess of the island, the recognition was immediate.",
      "She had to wait for the next scheduled ship to Crete, a slim, easy moving commercial ship with vines painted at its side.",
      "In the end, she finds herself eager to return home.",
      "The sun blinding her, she climbs down the ship, and blesses everything she can think of for the ground beneath her feet.",
      "Without care for the crowd in the port, she kneels down and kisses the soil of her home.",
      "Once her head and her gaze are clearer, she can see all eyes stuck on her; she can count the varying emotions.",
      "She can feel intense hatred, and she can feel admiration, and she can feel love, and confusion, of course, and then, expectance.",
      "She greets those who greet her, and smiles, her heart pounding in her chest.",
      "Then, she sees the priestesses.",
      "It's like a committee of them, distinct clothes and hair, and bright, bright faces when they see her, and smiles like they're sharing a secret.",
      "They clasp her hands and hug her and eagerly lead her to the eldest one, the great priestess who's taught her almost everything she knows.",
      "\"You did right, child\", she says after welcoming her back.",
      "\"But it's not a finished job and it will probably be a long time before you can say you're even remotely done.\"",
      "She nods, unnerved.",
      "It's Phaedra she sees next.",
      "They all walk to the palace together from one of the side roads; it will be some time before she can show herself at court, so they take the way that leads directly to hers and Phaedra's rooms.",
      "And Phaedra, oh Phaedra, she cries when she sees her and Ariadne finds herself crying too, tears spilling and hands clenching on her sister's back as she hugs her.",
      "Phaedra had said, you can't do this, you absolutely can't, father will kill you; she'd hugged her before she left and wished her a good luck; but Phaedra had also told her, I know you can do this and I know it's your choice and I will help you, and so she did.",
      "They had talked about this before she'd left, lying in Phaedra's beddings at night: you're a priestess, Phaedra'd said, father can't shun you because you're under the great priestess' protection.",
      "And the great priestess, who had opposed the king's decision to punish Athens, offered Ariadne help and safety and her own power to their cause.",
      "She regards them both from head to toe now; she's known them since they were babies and now here are trying to oppose their father's authority.",
      "This won't be easy, she tells them, but it can work.",
      "\"We'll make it work\", Ariadne says, stern, and Phaedra chuckles.",
      "She ushers them all in an inner room, shadowy but comfortable, and they fill Ariadne in with what she doesn't know, but had predicted: Minos' rage, his threats, the council's worries, the people's mixed reactions.",
      "Nothing they can't work with.",
      "Phaedra is Minos' only heiress, so she will have to gain power inside the council; Ariadne, as a holy woman, has different access to the people.",
      "A lot of them almost worship her already; the girls don't doubt there will be stories of her actions for a long time and she doesn't know how to feel about this, but she knows she'll have to use it to her advantage.",
      "It's a thing she can't quite wrap her mind around, herself such a powerful and influential person, but maybe it's for the best, because it's not herself she wants the power for.",
      "Next to her, Phaedra squeezes her hand momentarily.",
      "What a compassionate, loved queen she's going to be, Ariadne thinks.",
      "Opposite her, the great priestess has her face turned to the only window, and the sun paints her face golden, gleams on her earrings.",
      "The old woman is plotting with a sneaky, delighted smirk, and if Ariadne is going to be a woman of power, she wants to do it with as much joy as the priestess does.",
      "In a room full of deceitfully giggly girls, Ariadne finds herself not only decisive, but also hopeful."

    "text": "Hades nearly screamed when he saw another boy sitting in the small field where he usually snuck into and played. Not to mention the new person there, the land didn't look so trashed anymore, like someone had been turning it into a garden or something. Did that mean someone had moved into that empty house? He slowly started to try and pull back only to find that he'd gotten stuck in the small whole he usually crawled through. That's what he got for not having visited in a while and stopping halfway through. Hades continued to try and push him through though, not caring which way he went as long as he got out. A rather loud squawking sound left him as he managed to move forward a bit, feeling something scraping at the skin of his stomach as he did. The other little boy jumped at the sound and looked over at him with wide blue eyes. Hades stared back at him for a moment before going back to pushing. He looked up again when he managed another few painful centimeters. He gasped then, finding himself face to face with the little boy. Hades was eight and a half so this kid had to be like five or six. \"What'cha doing, spotty face?\" The boy asked, watching him curiously. \"I'm stuck,\" He snapped back, continuing to wiggle. \"And my names not spotty face,\" \"It's not? But your face is all spotty and so're your arms,\" The other kid nodded sagely. He groaned at that. \"My names Hades. Now are you going to help me or just stand there,\" It wasn't like he was some circus show. \"Oh, right. I'm Priapus,\" the younger boy infromed him as he grabbed onto Hades shoulders and began to pull. \"Congratulations,\" Hades grumbled as he began to push as well. A pained scream left him as he felt out onto the ground. Priapus blue eyes went wide and he wobbled of quickly screaming for his dad. Hades groaned and tried to sit up, falling back and crying out in pain as he did. He lifted just his head then to look at himself and saw that his shirt was ripped open and bloody. Great. That was his last shirt. It didn't take long for Priapus to return with a man who Hades assumed was his father. They both looked Hades over with worried expressions then the man moved to pick him up and Hades flailed his arms at him, smacking his helping hands away. \"Hades what are you doing? You're hurt,\" Priapus scolded, his little face scrunched with worry. The man tried again, ignoring Hades' feeble smacks this time as he hooked his arms around him and lifted him up. \"Calm down, I need to get you to the hospital,\" \"No!\" Hades screamed, kicking and flailing dispite the pain, desperately trying to get free. The man held tight though, not setting him down until he was inside the car as Priapus scrambled in nest to him on the backseat. The man turned to his son then and handed him a small hand towel that he must have brought with him. \"Pri, I need you to hold this towel to where he's bleeding, alright?\" The little boy nodded and did as he was told as Hades began to shake,. \"No, please sir. I'm sorry I broke in, I didn't know anyone lived here. I'm sorry, I promise I won't do it again,\" he pleaded, fighting back tears. The man shook his head as he got in the drivers seat and headed off. \"It'll be alright. They'll just stitch you up and make sure you don't have any infections. We can call your parents there too and just explain that it was all an accident, kay?\" \"No,\" Hades pleaded, tears beginning to fall as his mind grew fuzzy. \"Please, no. I don't want to go back, I can't. You might as well just leave me on the road here. Please,\" The man gave him a wide-eyed look before turning his attention back to the road silently as he continued to drive. Priapus pressed a wet kiss to Hades cheek then and smiled at him. \"It'll be okay. You'll see,\" It all went black then. --10 years later-- \"How on earth does someone who missed the first three years of school graduate from High school with honors?\" Priapus taunted from where he sat on Hades' bed. Hades just rolled his eyes, and finished pulling on his slacks. One of his hands pausing as it ran across the old scar on his stomach. Priapus seemed to notice the lingering touch because he got up and moved behind Hades, running his fingers along it as well. \"It's almost gone. Aren't you excited?\" \"Not really,\" Hades replied softly. \"It's like a trophy now, reminding me of the day we met,\" It was Priapus who rolled his eyes this time, moving to lightly brush their lips together. \"You are so sentimental at times,\" \"And you are so lucky I was never fully adopted,\" Hades shot back with a smile as he reached for his dress shirt. \"I know,\" Pri grinned as he kissed Hades full on. \"Come on, Spotty Face, hurry up and get dressed. You've got a graduation to speak at,\" Dionysus jumped as his son bolted out of Hades' room, quickly followed by a flying dress shoe and Hades' shout. \"I don't even have freckles anymore!\"",

      "He lifted just his head then to look at himself and saw that his shirt was ripped open and bloody.",
      "Great.",
      "That was his last shirt.",
      "It didn't take long for Priapus to return with a man who Hades assumed was his father.",
      "They both looked Hades over with worried expressions then the man moved to pick him up and Hades flailed his arms at him, smacking his helping hands away.",
      "\"Hades what are you doing?",
      "You're hurt,\" Priapus scolded, his little face scrunched with worry.",
      "The man tried again, ignoring Hades' feeble smacks this time as he hooked his arms around him and lifted him up.",
      "\"Calm down, I need to get you to the hospital,\" \"No!\"",
      "Hades screamed, kicking and flailing dispite the pain, desperately trying to get free.",
      "The man held tight though, not setting him down until he was inside the car as Priapus scrambled in nest to him on the backseat.",
      "The man turned to his son then and handed him a small hand towel that he must have brought with him.",
      "\"Pri, I need you to hold this towel to where he's bleeding, alright?\"",
      "The little boy nodded and did as he was told as Hades began to shake,.",
      "\"No, please sir.",
      "I'm sorry I broke in, I didn't know anyone lived here.",
      "I'm sorry, I promise I won't do it again,\" he pleaded, fighting back tears.",
      "The man shook his head as he got in the drivers seat and headed off.",
      "\"It'll be alright.",
      "They'll just stitch you up and make sure you don't have any infections.",
      "We can call your parents there too and just explain that it was all an accident, kay?\"",
      "\"No,\" Hades pleaded, tears beginning to fall as his mind grew fuzzy.",
      "\"Please, no. I don't want to go back, I can't.",
      "You might as well just leave me on the road here.",
      "Please,\" The man gave him a wide-eyed look before turning his attention back to the road silently as he continued to drive.",
      "Priapus pressed a wet kiss to Hades cheek then and smiled at him.",
      "\"It'll be okay.",
      "You'll see,\" It all went black then.",
      "--10 years later-- \"How on earth does someone who missed the first three years of school graduate from High school with honors?\"",
      "Priapus taunted from where he sat on Hades' bed.",
      "Hades just rolled his eyes, and finished pulling on his slacks.",
      "One of his hands pausing as it ran across the old scar on his stomach.",
      "Priapus seemed to notice the lingering touch because he got up and moved behind Hades, running his fingers along it as well.",
      "\"It's almost gone.",
      "Aren't you excited?\"",
      "\"Not really,\" Hades replied softly.",
      "\"It's like a trophy now, reminding me of the day we met,\" It was Priapus who rolled his eyes this time, moving to lightly brush their lips together.",
      "\"You are so sentimental at times,\" \"And you are so lucky I was never fully adopted,\" Hades shot back with a smile as he reached for his dress shirt.",
      "\"I know,\" Pri grinned as he kissed Hades full on.",
      "\"Come on, Spotty Face, hurry up and get dressed.",
      "You've got a graduation to speak at,\" Dionysus jumped as his son bolted out of Hades' room, quickly followed by a flying dress shoe and Hades' shout.",
      "\"I don't even have freckles anymore!\""

    "text": "I. Athena doesn't create, give birth, or nurture. She has no mother and intends to have no offspring, and she's as removed from the cycle of life as it's possible for any woman to be. So when Zeus asks the gods to fashion a woman to send to the world of humans, she intends to take no part in this, either. But when Hephaestus has created this wonder, he sets her lifeless form in front of Athena and asks her to give it life, as she gave life to Prometheus' creation. This reminder of her earlier transgression, she knows, is meant to insure her compliance. But in truth, she is captivated with this creation. Athena touches its - her - forehead and endows her with a mind, as she had done for Prometheus' first man and wills it to life, but nothing happens. Prometheus' man was created in his image, with care and tenderness, but Athena knows that Hephaestus' creation - beautiful as it is - was fashioned with all the cool mastery of his limitless skills and none of Prometheus' warmth. She runs her fingers along her lifeless form, finally letting her hand rest against its heart. She aligns her lips with hers, and breathes her life into it. And as the heart beneath her hand starts to beat, and the woman opens her eyes to stare into Athena's eyes, she feels her own heart racing and tightening, and well, Athena might as well have created her herself. Zeus allows Athena to name her, and she calls her Pandora. All-gifted, but she is meant to be anything but a blessing. \"He intends her as a punishment, you know,\" Hera says to her, \"As if the company of women is such a misfortune.\" Aphrodite laughs and says, \"The way men lose their heads in the presence of a beautiful woman is a misfortune.\" \"It is not as if Epimetheus has much of a mind to begin with,\" replies Athena. \"Prometheus won't be taken in as easily with beauty,\" Hera warns. \"You overestimate him,\" Aphrodite says. \"Perhaps,\" replies Hera, \"but beauty isn't all she'll have, is it?\" And as Hera looks at her, Athena already knows that she will send Pandora into the world of men better armed than Zeus would like her to be. II. They give her beauty, grace, and guile before they give her awareness. So the first thing Pandora remembers being aware of is her own vanity. But that's not as bad a thing as men make it out to be, Aphrodite tells her, \"They'd just as well not have you know your own strengths.\" But that is not her only strength, she learns from Athena, who teaches her to knit and weave. Hera warns her against the evils of men, \"And there will only be men where you're going.\" She takes all of this in, but without fully understanding the weight of their words or warnings. When she's made pleasing enough through the lessons and the gifts of these goddesses, Zeus cannot wait to put his plan in motion. He gives her a jar - intricately painted in golds and reds - to take with her. \"I cannot send you into the world empty-handed,\" he tells her, \"Take this jar with you, filled with all the blessings I can endow upon mankind.\" Pandora's hands graze over the jar, and her fingers play with its latch. \"Take care,\" Zeus warns her, \"to never open this jar. If you let out the blessings contained within, mankind will despair and eradicate itself.\" Zeus smiles and relies on Athena's final gift - curiosity and not wisdom - to compel Pandora into transgressing against his decree. Athena smiles as she touches Pandora's forehead and endows her with this last gift. And Zeus does not realize that curiosity can lead to wisdom. III. She is given to Epimetheus in marriage, and the gods themselves make up her wedding procession. Once the festivities are over, the gods make their way back to Olympus. Athena lingers on after everyone has left, and Pandora clings to her, reluctant to be left behind in this unfamiliar place. * She understands the jar to be a wedding present now. In the emptiness of Epimetheus' house, it's the only thing that's a reminder of her previous life. She traces the patterns on its surface and knows that they were painted by Athena. The jar has its lure, and it sings to her sometimes, so that she spends her wedding night with the jar in her bed, her ear pressed against its earthen surface, listening to all the creatures buzzing inside. She does not open it; she remembers Zeus' warning. * Epimetheus spends most of his time out in the fields, teaching men the use of cattle and land, or out assembling with them. When he is there, he does not say much, but she often catches his gaze lingering on her, so she does not retrieve the jar from its hiding place inside her armoire when he's there. She knows he has seen it, but he has yet to question her about it. He comes to her bed on most nights, but is gone almost always before she wakes. She finds herself constantly alone, and misses the company of the goddesses, and remembers both Aphrodite's words and Hera's warnings. But she knows that it's the unspoken warning from Athena that she needs to decipher. * One morning, she awakens to the sound of men arguing, and it's such a novel occurrence that she's startled out of sleep and is out of her bed before she can even wonder who is out there. Other men are forbidden from entering her house by Epimetheus. She is not sure if he mistrusts her or them, but the only time she has seen anyone other than Epimetheus was at her wedding, where everyone had gathered. The door is closed, but she can hear the voices through it. Even so, she presses her ear against the wooden door and listens. \"I warned you, Epimetheus,\" says an unfamiliar voice, \"And you defied me.\" \"I am your equal, Prometheus,\" she hears her husband's voice, \"and not yours to command. I will choose who I let into my house and my life.\" \"It's a trick,\" says Prometheus, \"and a mistake you'll come to regret. And mankind will pay for your lust. As if there weren't a hundred lovelier nymphs to choose from.\" \"She's far lovelier than any,\" counters her husband, defending her form but not her character. She's heard enough, so she pulls herself away from the door and releases the latch to step outside, and Prometheus halts what he was about to say, and she sees the anger in his eyes soften as he looks at her, and bows, and says, \"Forgive me. I did not mean to wake you.\" She looks to her husband, who introduces Prometheus as his brother. And Pandora searches her memory for what she had heard the goddesses say about this wiser brother. His anger seems to return as he turns back to her husband, and says, \"Remember what I said, Epimetheus. Before it's too late.\" And with that warning, he turns and leaves. \"What was he angry about?\" Pandora asks Epimetheus. \"You have a curious mind,\" he tells her, smiling at her indulgently. But he does not answer her question. She tries again, \"Was he angry about me being here?\" \"These things are not your concern, Pandora,\" he tells her firmly, before following his brother out the door. * That night, Epimetheus returns home to find his wife in bed with the strange jar, her ear pressed against its surface, and her fingers tracing the outside lovingly. \"What is in that jar?\" he asks her, startling her out of her thoughts. This is not the first time he's found her with the jar, but it is the first time he questions her about it, and she can't help but think back to the visit from his brother. \"Why do you ask me this now?\" she says, sitting up and drawing the jar close to her. \"Because I want to know now.\" \"Tell me why your brother came here.\" \"I cannot,\" he says. \"Cannot or will not?\" she asks. \"I will not play your word games,\" he replies. \"Then I can't tell you about this,\" she takes the jar with her and places it inside the armoire, locking it and checking the lock again. * He does not come to her bed that night and is nowhere to be found the next morning or the one after. When the silence of the house and the loneliness begin to claw at her, she locks the door to her room and unlocks her armoire. She takes out the jar and sets it on the floor, and, laying herself beside it, she presses her ear to the jar and lets the creatures inside whisper to her. * Three days later, and still no sign of her husband, she places the jar back inside her armoire, and locking it, sets out to go find him. She says a prayer to Zeus before stepping outside and lets the path guide her away from her home and into the village. The men stare at her once she enters the village, and she draws her cloak closer to her and over her head. No one approaches her, however, and she herself is afraid to approach them. She stands on the outskirts of the fields, and shielding her eyes from the sun, tries to look for a man who might be her husband. She hears her name and turns around, expecting to see her husband, but it is Prometheus instead. \"What are you doing here?\" he asks her. She has no pleasantries for this man who seems to have turned her husband against her, so she turns the question on him, \"Have you seen Epimetheus?\" \"Not today,\" he says. \"And the day before?\" He shakes his head again, and she allows him to see a fraction of her despair and says, \"Where could he be?\" It is not that she loves Epimetheus, but he is her only connection to this world of men. The gods haven't spoken to her since they abandoned her here, and she cannot stand the silence of the house or the whispers inside the jar. He touches her arm and turns her around, away from the staring men, who seemed to have stopped their work to examine her. She has no doubt that they have been warned of her presence and by Prometheus most likely. \"Let me take you home,\" he says now, gently nudging her away from the fields, \"I will go look for my brother afterward.\" She's not sure if he's protecting her from the men or the men from her, and she tells him as much. He laughs and says, \"I am not sure, either.\" At least he is honest, and she finds that refreshing. * Epimetheus comes home the next morning, but he spends the day outside, only coming in for food. When night falls and he comes to her bed, he asks, \"Will you tell me about the jar now?\" She says, \"Will you tell me why the men in the village fear me?\" He scoffs and says, \"No one is afraid of you. There's nothing to be afraid of.\" \"Then why do they stare and refuse to talk to me?\" \"Because you're lovely and they have never seen a woman before. They don't know what to do with one.\" Pandora smiles at his flattery, but she's not fooled. \"Come now,\" he says, \"What's in that jar?\" The contents of the jar are no secret. Zeus had warned her against opening it, but there's nothing stopping her from telling her husband about what she suspects is contained within. Nothing except her knowledge that he's lying to her. So she tells a lie in return, repeating what Zeus told her, \"It is filled with blessings for mankind, and I must protect them from fleeing.\" He seems satisfied with that answer. * The truth is that she had begun to suspect Zeus' lie the moment she had lain next to the jar and pressed her ear against its surface. \"Be bold, be bold,\" the creatures inside would whisper to her, begging to be let out, and asking her to break her promise. * When Epimetheus goes out again the next morning, Pandora locks her jar again, locks her room, and sets out again for the fields. \"Looking for Epimetheus?\" Prometheus asks her when he sees her. She shakes her head and says, \"No, I am here for you.\" She has caught him off-guard, so she pushes her advantage and asks, \"What did you say to him to make him come back?\" \"Only that you were as much a pawn in Zeus' scheme as he is.\" Prometheus replies, \"I told him that you were harmless.\" Pandora doesn't like being dismissed as such, but she lets it go, and asks, \"And what scheme is that?\" \"His elaborate plan to make mankind forfeit the gifts that I granted them and the ones I won for them by tricking him.\" \"And what part do I play in that?\" \"I am not sure. I know only that you were sent here after I angered Zeus by tricking him.\" \"What did you do?\" Prometheus considers her question, and for a moment, she thinks that he is going to refuse to answer like Epimetheus. Instead, he holds out his hand and says, \"Come with me.\" She places her hand in his and lets him guide her into the village and inside a temple with sacrifices burning on an altar. \"Zeus tasked Epimetheus and me with populating the earth with creatures, giving us a set of attributes and gifts to bestow our creations with. Epimetheus created birds and gifted them with flight, created and gifted the cattle, the bees, and other creatures while I worked on a creature to rival them all. But Epimetheus had given away everything, leaving my creation without any blessings. So I stole fire from Olympus to bestow upon men,\" he pauses briefly before explaining, \"With fire comes...\" \"Reason, invention, and the ability to control time by creating light,\" Pandora finishes for him. \"You gave them the ability to control their lives.\" Prometheus nods, \"Precisely. Their only use to Zeus was that their sacrifices give him honor, even the animals were more useful to him than the creatures I had created. When Zeus found out about the theft of fire, he exiled me from Olympus, away from the company of gods, to live among humans.\" \"To punish you,\" Pandora says, understanding this much. \"In his mind, he does see it as punishment. But I like the company of humans better than serving Zeus' whims.\" Pandora considers this new knowledge and keeps it for another day. \"And me?\" she asks, \"Am I being punished too?\" He shakes his head, and says, \"Afterwards, I tricked Zeus into giving away the best portion of the sacrifices to feed humans, and he left the altar without retaliating.\" \"And you think I am his retribution?\" She finds her answer in his silence, and turns away from the altar and leaves the temple behind. * Sometimes, if she places her hand on the jar at just the right place, she can feel movement inside it. There's a kind of violence to these movements, as if whatever is inside is growing in force. Her fingers linger on the latch, and she wonders why there's a latch if she was never meant to open it and she thinks back to what Prometheus told her. She prays to Athena that night, but there's no revelation that comes to her. In truth, her time on Olympus has started to feel like a dream, and her memories are becoming harder to recall. * She stands outside the temple as the men celebrate at the altar, Epimetheus presiding over the sacrifices made in Zeus' name. She has not seen Prometheus since their conversation at the temple, but still, she is not surprised when she finds him standing next to her, his eyes at the altar. \"I suppose they do not know that Zeus has already sent a plaque to mankind, if they continue to worship him?\" she asks. He turns to look at her and says, \"I have been meaning to apologize for that day. You misunderstood me. I do not think you're here to harm us, but Zeus will use you to bring men misfortune.\" \"I think I would rather be an accomplice than a foolish pawn,\" she says, indicating the men kneeling at the altar. \"Are you an accomplice?\" he asks. \"What does it matter,\" she says, \"You have all decided to mistrust me anyway.\" \"They don't know you,\" he says, \"You hold yourself above them, still seeing yourself as part of Olympus and allied with the gods.\" \"And you don't?\" She says, \"The gods abandoned me, but you chose your exile. You would rather rule over these miserable sheep who can't see through the wrath of their vengeful deities than serve Zeus' whims.\" He turns to look at her, but does not say anything. She holds his gaze until he turns away to walk inside the temple. * There's a knock on their door in the middle of the night, and Epimetheus goes to see who it is. When he does not come back for long moments and she cannot will herself back to sleep, she slips out of the bed to go see what's keeping him. A wounded man lies on the floor just inside their door, and Epimetheus is leaning beside him, tending his wound. There are other men outside, cowering in fear and confusion, but they stay back, as if they can catch by proximity whatever is wrong with the fallen man. When his condition does not improve, the men start to slowly leave, and Pandora goes back inside her room, leaving her husband with the man. She hears the buzzing sound coming from inside her armoire as soon as she enters, and she turns around to lock the door before opening the armoire and taking out the jar. She sets it on her bed and sets her ear against it and listens to the whispers from inside. \"Let me out,\" it says, \"Let me out and I will help the man.\" Her fingers close around the latch, but before she could peek inside, she hears Prometheus outside. So she puts the jar away, and steps outside her room. She's surprised to find that the sun is out already. The wounded man looks worse than before, and her husband is nowhere in sight. \"Epimetheus has gone to the temple to speak with Zeus,\" Prometheus tells her. \"He is more likely to listen to him than to me.\" \"It's just one man,\" she says, not fully understanding why this matters. Prometheus shakes his head and she expects him to admonish her, but he says, \"Whatever befalls him will befall others, in time.\" \"Can you create more of them?\" \"Not without Athena giving them life, and she would not go against her father.\" Pandora isn't certain of that, but she nods. And then she asks, \"So you would just replace them, if you could, one man being as good as another?\" He hesitates before answering, considering his words. Finally, he says, \"They're not like you, Pandora. They don't...think, question, or struggle.\" His fingers brush her forehead, and she looks up at him. He says, \"I gave them fire, gave them the ability to invent, to create, and yet, they refuse to do anything without guidance. Not unless I show them.\" \"And they don't even worship you.\" She says, and then: \"But I won't either.\" \"I think,\" he says, his fingers lingering in her hair, \"I think you were right before. I was never meant to serve, and Zeus could not see me having any power. But that does not mean that I don't want to help them.\" She can see that he needs her validation for this, and there's a great sense of power in that, in being able to grant absolution to this man who is the closest on Earth to the gods on Olympus. And this is what first draws her in, so she lays her hand on his and entwines her fingers with the ones still in her hair, and she repeats, \"I won't worship you.\" And maybe, it's that that draws him in, too, because he leans in and kisses her. She's the one to pull away first, and she says, \"Epimetheus will be home soon.\" She turns away and goes inside her room, only to hear the buzzing of the jar. \"Let me out,\" another voice whispers to her, \"Let me out and I will help you.\" This time, she does not need to wonder what spirit is trying to lure her. Desire. * And so she sets out to name all the creatures in the jar. She names them for the things she saw on Olympus but she has not found on earth. But they are not all blessings, she knows this now. The day her husband returns home late and does not come to her bed, she wonders if he knows about Prometheus, but she finds him outside early the next morning with a lovely forest nymph and she can hear the words of Hera in her mind. She goes back inside and names the creature now whispering to her Jealousy. Strangely, it has no lure for her. * A week later, and Epimetheus stops coming home. In the silence of the empty house, the whispers get louder and louder until Pandora wakes up in the middle of one night, her hands pressed against her ears and screams for them to stop. They quiet down for a few moments, and then the whispers of \"Let me out,\" and \"Be bold, be bold\" start again. She slips out of her bed and does not care about the time of night. Grabbing her cloak, she goes out wandering, away from the voices. As dawn breaks, she finds herself in the field where she had encountered Prometheus before. \"Pandora?\" She hears him call her, and turns to find him behind her, as if thinking of him had summoned him from the ether, like one of the gods. \"Are you looking for Epimetheus?\" He asks, \"Or did you come here for me?\" She wonders if he would lie to her about Epimetheus or tell her the truth for his own purposes, but she is not sure that she is ready to lose the only bit of honesty she has found here, so she says, \"I know where Epimetheus is,\" before he can say anything else. \"Did he tell you?\" He asks in such a way that she knows he is aware of Epimetheus' transgression. \"I don't think honesty is one of his virtues,\" she replies. \"Nor courage,\" he says. \"No, I found out myself,\" she says. He gives her a smile that's equal parts affection and sadness, and says, \"Of course, you did.\" When she returns his smile, he asks, \"Then why did you come here?\" She knows what he wants to hear, but she won't repay his honesty with a lie, so she says, \"I did not want to be in the house by myself.\" \"Did you,\" he starts, hesitating at first, and then says, \"Do you want me to come back with you?\" \"No!\" she says with more force than necessary, but seeing the stricken expression on his face, amends gently, \"No. I want to stay here for a while.\" He nods and she stays. * When night falls again and she would still not go home, he asks, \"Is it Epimetheus you fear?\" \"I don't think he is coming back,\" she replies. And maybe it's because he doesn't question her or ask her to explain her fears that she's compelled to tell him about the jar. So she does, starting with Zeus' words and ending with her own observations. When she is done, he only says, \"You must never open that jar.\" \"You and Zeus seem to agree on that, it seems,\" she says, knowing that the comparison would not please him. \"He gave you the jar and made it forbidden and gifted you with a questioning mind. He is relying on you to solve its mystery.\" These are all things she has considered herself, but she is not ready to concede. So she says, \"It was not Zeus who gifted me with curiosity. It was Athena.\" \"And you think one is very different from another?\" \"Why would Zeus ask me to keep the blessings in the jar, when doing so would ensure that I never open it? Why not simply ask me to never open it and leave it at that?\" \"You have a curious mind,\" he says, \"He knows you would never have been satisfied with a lack of an explanation. Besides, opening a jar to peek inside is the act of a foolish person, but to open the jar to let the blessings escape would be the work of a malicious person. He wants you to commit a transgression, so you can share the punishment with humanity.\" When she does not reply, he says, \"Promise me, Pandora, that you will not open that jar.\" And he seems to think that she would honor a promise made to him over one she made to the king of gods. * She wakes up in the middle of the night to someone whispering her name, and she's filled with terror at the thought that the voices have found her out here, so far away from their source. But as her mind awakens, she realizes that it's a single voice and not the buzz of multiple creatures whispering. Prometheus seems to be oblivious to them in his slumber, so she gets up and follows the voice to its source, behind the field and into the village. When she comes to a clearing, the form of Athena materializes before her and she's filled with such reverence and longing that she's made speechless. She knows that she shouldn't question Athena and that to ask Athena to place her loyalty with her father or her creation would be akin to blasphemy. But she is as she was made, and so she says, \"Have you come to test me further? Have I not done marvelously with the task I was given?\" \"At the task given by Zeus or the one you have set out on yourself?\" Athena asks. \"Do not speak to me in riddles. I have had enough of those to decipher here.\" \"And have you? Deciphered them?\" \"I know that jar is not filled with blessings,\" she says. \"But is it filled with something I should guard?\" Athena smiles and says, \"You already know what is inside the jar.\" \"Desire, despair, jealousy, plague, need,\" says Pandora, naming all of the spirits she has identified, \"And something that will grant relief to a wounded man whose body will not heal itself.\" \"Death,\" Athena says and names it for her. \"Death?\" Pandora questions. \"Something to set humans apart from gods. To make their lives limited.\" \"So it's a mercy as well as a curse,\" Pandora says. \"It is whatever humanity will make of it. As are other spirits.\" \"But to unleash these creatures on men who are like children and cannot fend for themselves would be...malicious,\" Pandora says, thinking back to Prometheus' words. \"They won't be children forever. Learning comes from suffering,\" Athena says, \"It is the eternal law.\" And just like that, she feels that she can trust Athena. So she asks, \"What should I do?\" She does not expect an answer, not when Athena gave her the ability to question and the persistence to look for answers. And she does not really get one, \"You should continue your adventure,\" Athena says. \"You should...\" \"Be bold?\" Pandora asks. \"Be bold,\" Athena confirms. And then says, \"But not too bold, Pandora.\" Pandora nods and lets her lips curve into a smile, and as she watches Athena flicker out of sight, she hears the goddess' departing words in her mind, \"There's still one spirit left to name. And you must name it first.\" * She knows she has to return to her house, if she is to name the last spirit. So she lets Prometheus come back with her. They do not talk about Epimetheus or Zeus, or even the jar, but these things are never far from either of their minds. The spirits still talk to her, even as the jar remains locked inside her armoire. Prometheus never asks to see it, and she feels compelled to keep it to herself. One day, he finds her tilting her head towards the armoire as he talks to her and feels her drifting off, so he says, \"We should bury the jar.\" \"Bury it?\" \"Far away, so you can have some peace.\" When she shakes her head at that suggestion, he says, \"I can take it away, so you would not know where it is, would not be lured by the spirits.\" \"Do you not trust me?\" \"I want to help you,\" he says, \"You should not have to guard this secret alone, nor be subjected to this madness.\" \"I need more time,\" she says, and he lets it go for now. * When she finds herself with child, in the coming months, she is glad to have Prometheus with her. He is the first to realize what she is suffering from and tells her what to expect. She does not know if the child belongs to Prometheus or his brother, and in truth, she does not care. As she lies awake in her bed these nights, she expects the child to whisper to her, to make its existence known to her in some way, like the spirits inside the jar. But for now, she only has Prometheus' words to confirm what she is going through. As her belly begins to grow, the only thing she finds herself hoping for is that she is carrying a girl. A boy will belong to his father, to this world of men where she finds herself utterly alone. But a girl will be all hers; created in her own image, and perhaps then she'll understand the vanity Prometheus sees in humanity. Between the baby waking her up at night, and the voices keeping her from sleeping, her already tenuous hold on her mind seems to be slipping. She does not know how long she'll be carrying the baby, not even after Prometheus explained the passage of time in this instance, but she knows that she can let the spirits free whenever she wants. But after months of listening to them, she is starting to doubt even Athena. Perhaps, she played a trick on her in telling her that there's an unnamed spirit inside the jar, because even when she coaxes the voices to talk to her, to tell her about themselves, there's nothing to be heard there that she hasn't catalogued and identified already. So she lets the months pass, lets Prometheus heal the pain inside her head, and lets the voices go on whispering. * One afternoon, when the silence of the house and the noise of the voices get to be too much for her, she goes out looking for Prometheus and finds herself at the temple. She has avoided coming here in the past months, for the fear of running into Epimetheus. Prometheus does not speak of him being at the temple, but in her mind, her husband is not much different from the men who seem to occupy the temple at all times. There's a simplicity to them both that she cannot help but feel disdain for, and she is not sure if this feeling came after Epimetheus left her, or if Prometheus is right and she has always held herself above these men. She forgets that Prometheus, too, is inherently connected to these men, in his mind and deeds, at least, if not in hers. So she knows that she would find him here, before she ever sets foot inside the temple. The wounded man from so long ago, whom she had completely forgotten, is still at the temple, and there are more there now. None of them ever recover, but they cannot die either. She finds Prometheus in a room filled with such men, and she wonders if maybe this is Zeus' retribution and not whatever is in her jar. As she waits for Prometheus to notice her presence and watches over these men, Pandora, for the first time perhaps, feels something other than indifference for these men. She feels pity, and she feels responsible for them, knowing that their fate lies in her hands. There is a sense of power in that, too, in being able to define the destiny of this race. Her hand sits gently on her belly as she considers them, knowing that the fate of her child, too, will be linked to them. When Prometheus notices her, he leaves their side and comes to her, placing his hand on her elbow and leading her out of the room. She laughs and says, \"I will not catch their wounds by looking at them.\" \"You should not add to your worries,\" he replies. \"Their fate does not concern me,\" she says, and it is the closest she has come to lying to him. But the half-lie is more for her than for him. \"No, but the fate of your child does. And you worry that he'll share these weaknesses.\" \"I can help them, you know,\" she offers. \"By unleashing Zeus' curse on these men you have nothing but contempt for?\" he asks, but his words are not an accusation. \"It does not have to be a curse. You are starting to become like them, in thinking everything a curse,\" Pandora says, \"The men say that my curiosity is a curse, but it is what sets me apart from them.\" \"They mistrust what they have no experience of,\" he says, \"And you still think you are better than them.\" She says, \"I do not compare myself to them. You think I am better than them.\" \"I do think you are better than everyone else,\" he agrees with a smile, and she can let this be the end of it. But she says, \"You cannot want these men to simper like sheep for all of their existence? They cut themselves with axes more than build anything for themselves, burn themselves with fire more often than use it for invention. Does it flatter you to have them be this far below you, so you can always hold yourself above them?\" \"Does it flatter you to think you can save them?\" \"I have never denied my vanity,\" she says. \"It is you who insists on wanting to be humble. Besides, I do not want to save them,\" she says, \"I want them to be worthy of your gifts, and they will never learn their use, not without these spirits you call curses.\" He considers her words for a time, before saying, \"Pandora, you must not open that jar.\" \"And you must never presume to tell me what to do,\" she says, before turning away and tracing back her steps out of the temple. * The voices are already buzzing when she returns home, and it is easy to put the argument with Prometheus behind her with the spirits demanding her attention. She knows they will always be at odds on this matter. Pandora has seen the gods, lived with them, and envied them. She would like nothing more than for her child to be blessed with the gifts of Athena, Aphrodite, and Hera, for her to have all the potential of the gods. But Prometheus has seen the gods, too, and he has nothing but contempt for them. He needs his creation to be free of the taint of corruption that he sees in the gods. And she will never know which one of them has it right until she opens that jar. The words of Athena echo in her mind, and merge into the whispers of the voices asking her to be bold, to let them out. And suddenly, she needs to know if her goddess had tricked her, if Prometheus was right about Athena. She needs to know if Prometheus' love for her will survive her doing something that goes against his principles, needs to know if he is worthy of her love, that she has guarded as closely as the jar itself. And she must know the name of the last spirit, the one who seems to have eluded her thus far. So in the end, it is her curiosity that compels her, but it is anything but a thoughtless choice. She unlocks the armoire, takes out the jar and places it on her bed. Placing her hands on its intricately curved surface, she coaxes the voices to speak to her. But as if they can read her mind, they hold their peace in anticipation. The silence is unnerving, and she hesitates. She knows that much suffering would come from this, even if she is right about this, before anything good comes. And she knows that she - and her child - will share in this suffering. The men will say that they were right about her, about her being a curse, being the form that Zeus' retribution took. And they will never forgive her, but she does not need their adoration the way Prometheus does. So she takes a deep breath, unhinges the latch, and opens the lid. She is instantly taken aback by the force with which the spirits rush out of the jar, toppling it over, and she herself staggers backwards from it. They are louder now, as they escape from the jar and disappear once in the air. She watches them leave, one by one, and they blur into each other. She cannot name them all now, even if she wanted to. The baby grows restless and Pandora places a hand on her belly to sooth it, and reaches for the jar with her other hand. She peeks inside it as the spirits continue to rush out and through her, and she feels all of the things she's held inside as they pass through her until she's filled with a sense of despair. And so it is now that she sees, rather than hears, the last spirit. It is crawling its way out of the jar, unlike the other spirits, who had wings and took to the wind. And she knows why this spirit has never spoken to her: it has no lure of its own, but it is inevitable in a world filled with death, despair, destruction, and with other spirits she's let out. She knows also that the crux of Zeus' plan rests on this spirit escaping. She names it Hopelessness and closes the jar before it can escape out into the world. She will take whatever punishment Zeus has in store for her. * (It will always be said, later, that she played into Zeus' hands. In truth, however, Hopelessness was Zeus' main weapon against humanity. Having unleashed the spirits on mankind, it was going to be the last spirit that was going to ensure that men would give up on life and fade into oblivion, forfeiting the gifts given to them by Prometheus.) * IV. The jar is still in her bed when the birth pangs start, and she drags herself into the bed. With her husband, Prometheus, and even the voices of the spirits gone, she's utterly alone. But placing her hands on her belly, and feeling the tremors there, she has never felt so wholly connected to anything else. She drifts into a restless sleep before another pang wakes her up, and she opens her eyes to find Athena sitting beside her, stroking her hair. She grimaces through the pain and tries to keep her eyes open and on Athena's face, searching it for guidance in this. \"I think...,\" Athena says, \"I think you are supposed to push.\" \"You think?\" Pandora questions her. \"This is my first experience with birthing, too, Pandora,\" Athena reminds her. \"This has always been more of Artemis' realm.\" And Pandora remembers that, like her, Athena is a motherless child, and a goddess who has chosen chastity and has deliberately removed herself from this sphere. Still, she is here now, for her. She knows that she can call upon Artemis to come aid her in this, but she does not even wish to share this moment with Prometheus. So she tells Athena, \"We will figure it out together.\" Athena smiles, and Pandora drifts off again. * When the baby comes, Athena herself pulls her out of Pandora's womb, and she holds the baby to her chest and touches her forehead first with her fingers and then with her lips, blessing the infant with reason and curiosity. This is the first human being that Athena herself hasn't breathed life into, but the affection she feels for the child isn't any less for that fact. She places the baby in Pandora's arms and lets her rest. * \"What does Zeus have in store for us?\" Pandora asks, when she finds Athena still by her side upon waking. \"Nothing good,\" says Athena. \"Will we survive it?\" Pandora asks. \"Your daughter will,\" Athena says, \"I will protect her, and your descendants will have the potential to become like the gods, under my guidance.\" \"Like the gods,\" Pandora repeats, \"I do not think Prometheus will be pleased with that.\" \"Prometheus will have other things to concern him, in the coming days, and when time comes, he'll be grateful for what you have set in motion.\" Before Pandora can ask more questions, Athena says, \"Enough, Pandora. You must let life hold some of its mysteries. Or figure them out yourself.\" Athena runs the back of her fingers on the baby's forehead, clasping Pandora's hand in her other hand. As she slowly flickers out of sight, Pandora knows that she will not see her again. She names her daughter Pyrrha and hopes for that to be the last time she names anything. V. She finds Prometheus on a deserted mountaintop, after months of wandering around. She learned of his new punishment from Epimetheus. And even though she was warned, she is still surprised to see him chained to the rocks, being fed upon by a vulture. The vulture takes flight as she approaches, and she watches as Prometheus' wounds heal in front of her eyes. \"You opened the jar,\" he says, as a way of greeting. \"You knew I would,\" she replies. \"And now we must all pay the price.\" \"Why are you being punished for what I did?\" \"Did Athena not tell you this?\" he asks. She hasn't seen Athena since she gave birth, but she has been having dreams that she attributes to the goddess. It was the dreams that led her here. Still, she shakes her head. \"Pandora,\" he says, \"At least, let me take some blame for this. My feud with Zeus is older than your creation.\" \"But he was content to have you in exile,\" she points out. \"Until you defied him, and he tried to punish you by punishing me,\" Prometheus says. \"Or Athena intervened on your behalf, made Zeus think you were harmless, and so directed his wrath towards me instead.\" \"At least,\" Pandora says, \"You don't think I am harmless anymore.\" He laughs and says, \"I cannot blame you, not when what led you to open the jar are the things that drew me in.\" \"And not when you wanted the same thing as me, to mold mankind to your liking.\" \"Much suffering will come from your way,\" he says. \"And your men will be better for it,\" she says. \"Better at treachery, deceit, and all the pettiness of the gods,\" he replies. \"And their wisdom, creativity, and aspirations,\" she says, \"We will never agree on this.\" \"Given eternity, we might. I am not going anywhere.\" She hesitates, and then says, \"I do not have an eternity,\" thinking back to the spirit Athena named Death and to Athena's prophecy about her daughter being the only human to survive Zeus' planned retribution, but she does not tell him that. \"And that is as you wished it,\" he tells her. \"It is,\" she says, and maybe, she's lying to him, but what she really regrets, more than her own coming doom, is that she will not get to see what she has set in motion. \"It is okay to admit regrets,\" he tells her. \"You want me to have regrets so you can feel that your view of it was right, but I told you before, I will not be like your creation and bend to your will that easily.\" \"That's not what I want,\" he says, and as if to prove his point, he says, \"I regret not listening to you when you offered to help the men at the temple.\" \"I do not regret opening the jar,\" she says, and then gesturing towards his chains, adds, \"But I do regret this.\" \"I am to be rescued by one of your descendants, when the time comes, by one of these humans who will be like the gods,\" he tells her. \"I am glad,\" she says, knowing that she will not be there for that day. For now, she stays there till nightfall, giving him respite from that day's punishment. VI. Now that it's quiet, Pandora lets the jar sit outside her room, on a window sill. The intricate cravings on it are once again just a reminder of Athena, and she still traces her fingers along their ridges sometimes. The men come to her now, when they need help with the harvest or need to show off some new invention. They still respect the rules set down by Epimetheus, and never step inside her house. So even out in the open, the jar is as safe as it was locked in her armoire. When Pyrrha is old enough to start reaching above her head, and Pandora finds her tiny fingers just starting to touch the bottom of the jar, she knows that it is time for even this reminder of Olympus to go. She remembers Prometheus' words, but she does not think that she wants the jar hidden too far away from her. So she finds an empty patch of grass just outside the window of her room, and she digs into the earth as far as she can, and she buries the jar inside. *",

      "And maybe it's because he doesn't question her or ask her to explain her fears that she's compelled to tell him about the jar.",
      "So she does, starting with Zeus' words and ending with her own observations.",
      "When she is done, he only says, \"You must never open that jar.\"",

      "\"Death?\" Pandora questions.",
      "\"Something to set humans apart from gods.",

      "\"I want to help you,\" he says, \"You should not have to guard this secret alone, nor be subjected to this madness.\"",
      "\"I need more time,\" she says, and he lets it go for now.",
      "* When she finds herself with child, in the coming months, she is glad to have Prometheus with her.",
      "He is the first to realize what she is suffering from and tells her what to expect.",
      "She does not know if the child belongs to Prometheus or his brother, and in truth, she does not care.",
      "As she lies awake in her bed these nights, she expects the child to whisper to her, to make its existence known to her in some way, like the spirits inside the jar.",

      "A boy will belong to his father, to this world of men where she finds herself utterly alone.",
      "But a girl will be all hers; created in her own image, and perhaps then she'll understand the vanity Prometheus sees in humanity.",
      "Between the baby waking her up at night, and the voices keeping her from sleeping, her already tenuous hold on her mind seems to be slipping.",
      "She does not know how long she'll be carrying the baby, not even after Prometheus explained the passage of time in this instance, but she knows that she can let the spirits free whenever she wants.",
      "But after months of listening to them, she is starting to doubt even Athena.",
      "Perhaps, she played a trick on her in telling her that there's an unnamed spirit inside the jar, because even when she coaxes the voices to talk to her, to tell her about themselves, there's nothing to be heard there that she hasn't catalogued and identified already.",
      "So she lets the months pass, lets Prometheus heal the pain inside her head, and lets the voices go on whispering.",
      "* One afternoon, when the silence of the house and the noise of the voices get to be too much for her, she goes out looking for Prometheus and finds herself at the temple.",
      "She has avoided coming here in the past months, for the fear of running into Epimetheus.",
      "Prometheus does not speak of him being at the temple, but in her mind, her husband is not much different from the men who seem to occupy the temple at all times.",
      "There's a simplicity to them both that she cannot help but feel disdain for, and she is not sure if this feeling came after Epimetheus left her, or if Prometheus is right and she has always held herself above these men.",
      "She forgets that Prometheus, too, is inherently connected to these men, in his mind and deeds, at least, if not in hers.",
      "So she knows that she would find him here, before she ever sets foot inside the temple.",
      "The wounded man from so long ago, whom she had completely forgotten, is still at the temple, and there are more there now.",
      "None of them ever recover, but they cannot die either.",
      "She finds Prometheus in a room filled with such men, and she wonders if maybe this is Zeus' retribution and not whatever is in her jar.",
      "As she waits for Prometheus to notice her presence and watches over these men, Pandora, for the first time perhaps, feels something other than indifference for these men.",
      "She feels pity, and she feels responsible for them, knowing that their fate lies in her hands.",
      "There is a sense of power in that, too, in being able to define the destiny of this race.",
      "Her hand sits gently on her belly as she considers them, knowing that the fate of her child, too, will be linked to them.",
      "When Prometheus notices her, he leaves their side and comes to her, placing his hand on her elbow and leading her out of the room.",
      "She laughs and says, \"I will not catch their wounds by looking at them.\"",
      "\"You should not add to your worries,\" he replies.",
      "\"Their fate does not concern me,\" she says, and it is the closest she has come to lying to him.",
      "But the half-lie is more for her than for him.",
      "\"No, but the fate of your child does.",
      "And you worry that he'll share these weaknesses.\"",
      "\"I can help them, you know,\" she offers.",
      "\"By unleashing Zeus' curse on these men you have nothing but contempt for?\" he asks, but his words are not an accusation.",
      "\"It does not have to be a curse.",
      "You are starting to become like them, in thinking everything a curse,\" Pandora says, \"The men say that my curiosity is a curse, but it is what sets me apart from them.\"",
      "\"They mistrust what they have no experience of,\" he says, \"And you still think you are better than them.\"",
      "She says, \"I do not compare myself to them.",
      "You think I am better than them.\"",
      "\"I do think you are better than everyone else,\" he agrees with a smile, and she can let this be the end of it.",
      "But she says, \"You cannot want these men to simper like sheep for all of their existence?",
      "They cut themselves with axes more than build anything for themselves, burn themselves with fire more often than use it for invention.",

      "\"I have never denied my vanity,\" she says.",
      "\"It is you who insists on wanting to be humble.",
      "Besides, I do not want to save them,\" she says, \"I want them to be worthy of your gifts, and they will never learn their use, not without these spirits you call curses.\"",
      "He considers her words for a time, before saying, \"Pandora, you must not open that jar.\"",
      "\"And you must never presume to tell me what to do,\" she says, before turning away and tracing back her steps out of the temple.",
      "* The voices are already buzzing when she returns home, and it is easy to put the argument with Prometheus behind her with the spirits demanding her attention.",
      "She knows they will always be at odds on this matter.",
      "Pandora has seen the gods, lived with them, and envied them.",
      "She would like nothing more than for her child to be blessed with the gifts of Athena, Aphrodite, and Hera, for her to have all the potential of the gods.",
      "But Prometheus has seen the gods, too, and he has nothing but contempt for them.",
      "He needs his creation to be free of the taint of corruption that he sees in the gods.",
      "And she will never know which one of them has it right until she opens that jar.",
      "The words of Athena echo in her mind, and merge into the whispers of the voices asking her to be bold, to let them out.",
      "And suddenly, she needs to know if her goddess had tricked her, if Prometheus was right about Athena.",
      "She needs to know if Prometheus' love for her will survive her doing something that goes against his principles, needs to know if he is worthy of her love, that she has guarded as closely as the jar itself.",
      "And she must know the name of the last spirit, the one who seems to have eluded her thus far.",
      "So in the end, it is her curiosity that compels her, but it is anything but a thoughtless choice.",
      "She unlocks the armoire, takes out the jar and places it on her bed.",
      "Placing her hands on its intricately curved surface, she coaxes the voices to speak to her.",
      "But as if they can read her mind, they hold their peace in anticipation.",
      "The silence is unnerving, and she hesitates.",
      "She knows that much suffering would come from this, even if she is right about this, before anything good comes.",
      "And she knows that she - and her child - will share in this suffering.",
      "The men will say that they were right about her, about her being a curse, being the form that Zeus' retribution took.",
      "And they will never forgive her, but she does not need their adoration the way Prometheus does.",
      "So she takes a deep breath, unhinges the latch, and opens the lid.",
      "She is instantly taken aback by the force with which the spirits rush out of the jar, toppling it over, and she herself staggers backwards from it.",
      "They are louder now, as they escape from the jar and disappear once in the air.",
      "She watches them leave, one by one, and they blur into each other.",
      "She cannot name them all now, even if she wanted to.",
      "The baby grows restless and Pandora places a hand on her belly to sooth it, and reaches for the jar with her other hand.",
      "She peeks inside it as the spirits continue to rush out and through her, and she feels all of the things she's held inside as they pass through her until she's filled with a sense of despair.",
      "And so it is now that she sees, rather than hears, the last spirit.",
      "It is crawling its way out of the jar, unlike the other spirits, who had wings and took to the wind.",
      "And she knows why this spirit has never spoken to her: it has no lure of its own, but it is inevitable in a world filled with death, despair, destruction, and with other spirits she's let out.",
      "She knows also that the crux of Zeus' plan rests on this spirit escaping.",
      "She names it Hopelessness and closes the jar before it can escape out into the world.",
      "She will take whatever punishment Zeus has in store for her.",
      "* (It will always be said, later, that she played into Zeus' hands.",
      "In truth, however, Hopelessness was Zeus' main weapon against humanity.",
      "Having unleashed the spirits on mankind, it was going to be the last spirit that was going to ensure that men would give up on life and fade into oblivion, forfeiting the gifts given to them by Prometheus.)",
      "* IV.",
      "The jar is still in her bed when the birth pangs start, and she drags herself into the bed.",
      "With her husband, Prometheus, and even the voices of the spirits gone, she's utterly alone.",
      "But placing her hands on her belly, and feeling the tremors there, she has never felt so wholly connected to anything else.",
      "She drifts into a restless sleep before another pang wakes her up, and she opens her eyes to find Athena sitting beside her, stroking her hair.",
      "She grimaces through the pain and tries to keep her eyes open and on Athena's face, searching it for guidance in this.",
      "\"I think...,\" Athena says, \"I think you are supposed to push.\"",
      "\"You think?\"",
      "Pandora questions her.",
      "\"This is my first experience with birthing, too, Pandora,\" Athena reminds her.",
      "\"This has always been more of Artemis' realm.\"",
      "And Pandora remembers that, like her, Athena is a motherless child, and a goddess who has chosen chastity and has deliberately removed herself from this sphere.",
      "Still, she is here now, for her.",
      "She knows that she can call upon Artemis to come aid her in this, but she does not even wish to share this moment with Prometheus.",
      "So she tells Athena, \"We will figure it out together.\"",
      "Athena smiles, and Pandora drifts off again.",
      "* When the baby comes, Athena herself pulls her out of Pandora's womb, and she holds the baby to her chest and touches her forehead first with her fingers and then with her lips, blessing the infant with reason and curiosity.",
      "This is the first human being that Athena herself hasn't breathed life into, but the affection she feels for the child isn't any less for that fact.",
      "She places the baby in Pandora's arms and lets her rest.",
      "* \"What does Zeus have in store for us?\" Pandora asks, when she finds Athena still by her side upon waking.",
      "\"Nothing good,\" says Athena.",
      "\"Will we survive it?\" Pandora asks.",
      "\"Your daughter will,\" Athena says, \"I will protect her, and your descendants will have the potential to become like the gods, under my guidance.\"",
      "\"Like the gods,\" Pandora repeats, \"I do not think Prometheus will be pleased with that.\"",
      "\"Prometheus will have other things to concern him, in the coming days, and when time comes, he'll be grateful for what you have set in motion.\"",
      "Before Pandora can ask more questions, Athena says, \"Enough, Pandora.",
      "You must let life hold some of its mysteries.",
      "Or figure them out yourself.\"",

      "As she slowly flickers out of sight, Pandora knows that she will not see her again.",
      "She names her daughter Pyrrha and hopes for that to be the last time she names anything.",
      "V. She finds Prometheus on a deserted mountaintop, after months of wandering around.",
      "She learned of his new punishment from Epimetheus.",
      "And even though she was warned, she is still surprised to see him chained to the rocks, being fed upon by a vulture.",
      "The vulture takes flight as she approaches, and she watches as Prometheus' wounds heal in front of her eyes.",

      "\"And that is as you wished it,\" he tells her.",
      "\"It is,\" she says, and maybe, she's lying to him, but what she really regrets, more than her own coming doom, is that she will not get to see what she has set in motion.",
      "\"It is okay to admit regrets,\" he tells her.",
      "\"You want me to have regrets so you can feel that your view of it was right, but I told you before, I will not be like your creation and bend to your will that easily.\"",
      "\"That's not what I want,\" he says, and as if to prove his point, he says, \"I regret not listening to you when you offered to help the men at the temple.\"",
      "\"I do not regret opening the jar,\" she says, and then gesturing towards his chains, adds, \"But I do regret this.\"",

      "She remembers Prometheus' words, but she does not think that she wants the jar hidden too far away from her.",

    "text": "Everyone says that I should have regrets. Don't get me wrong; I do. But they're not the regrets people expect of me. No one knows what it's like to be expected from birth to stand radiant under the heat of the summer sun when what you truly want is the soothing darkness of the deepest forest. I love my mother dearly, but I've never wanted to follow in her footsteps. I'm not Ishtar to play handmaiden and shadow to my lady's glory. My longing is and always has been for things never expected of me. I adore the quiet murmur of the underworld's shades. In my seasons there, they speak to me, spinning endless tails as intricate as any web Ariadne can weave. But perhaps I'm wrong; perhaps those like Ariadne could understand me. How do you shrug off the expectations when you know in your soul that you are meant for one thing and one thing only? Ariadne knows, I expect. Perhaps her taunting of Arachne was intentional, the only means by which she could liberate herself of the burden of everyone else's expectations. I don't know, and at this point I doubt Ariadne has any desire to tell me. And if there's one thing that living in the underworld has taught me, it's that everyone should be respected for the secrets they choose to keep. Shades by the thousands pass across the River Styx each year and only Chiron knows what secrets they choose to take with them to their rest. So no, I will not ask Ariadne whether she feels the same. She's as deserving of her silence as anyone else. Yes, I have my regrets, but ultimately, this place is my home. Regardless of how long I remain here, my mother will never cease her weeping. I would ask the gods to grant me permission to live here year round if it weren't for how badly that would break her. So what do I regret? I regret not being able to follow my own heart completely. I regret that my mother's grief will always be a tether, dragging me into the sun for half of every year whether I wish it or not. It's not what you expected of me, is it? But then, no one ever asked Ariadne what she wanted, did they?",

    "text": "You thought she'd wait for you while you were gone. You thought she would be an obedient, good wife. You thought she'd spend her days praying for your return and her nights missing you, wanting you. You thought she loved you. You thought you'd tamed her, made her meek and mild, broken her spirit. You never thought of your dead daughter, the one you'd sacrificed to the gods for your war. You thought she wouldn't, either. You thought you'd come home and walk straight into her welcoming arms. You thought she'd be happy that you had taken a lover, so she'd know you hadn't missed her too much. You thought she'd help raise your bastard daughter, who looked to you so like the one you'd lost. You arrived home, after ten long years, and she said she'd make up a bath for you. She greeted Cassandra, the mistress. She squeezed the baby girl's cheeks. She re-introduced you to your son, who idolised you. You ordered your men to unpack, and you waited for the bath to be ready. You heard from a maid that she had taken a lover of her own, while you were away. You were angry. Another man had tried to take what was yours. You thought up the perfect punishment while you waited. You thought of the banquet that evening, where you would tell tales of your battle, and be regarded a hero. You thought you'd get drunk, and pull her on to your lap. You thought you'd pleasure her under the table, run your hands over her firm breasts in front of everyone, while your equally drunk soldiers laughed and cheered you on, while your mistress and your children sat just down the table, hiding their faces in shame. You thought you would show her lover that she was yours, not his, that she would never, could never, be his. You thought you'd follow her up after she retired for the night. You thought you'd fuck her, hard, mark her all over with you, so she knew that she was yours too. And then you thought you'd call Cassandra in, and watch them pleasure each other, and have them both pleasure you. You thought the next day, you'd have her lover killed, and make her watch. You thought you'd tell her about her sister, how she'd shamed herself with Paris, and then with Diomedes, about how she was a whore who'd killed thousands, about all the ways in which Menelaus would punish her for her betrayal. You thought you'd be kind, and not tell her you knew about her affair, but come up with another reason to have her lover killed. You thought she might be angry, so you'd make up for it by giving her your bastard child to raise, like a second Iphigenia. A maid came to get you for your bath. You'd never seen her before, but you liked the curve of her ass. You thought you'd call her to your rooms and take her after you were clean. You knew she wouldn't say no. No one ever said no to you. You walked into the bath chamber, and found your wife waiting. You thought she smiled at you with her love for you. You thought maybe you'd kill her lover kindly and swiftly, because at least he'd kept her in shape, kept her pretty, kept her nubile. You ordered her to disrobe you, grabbing her with your meaty hands and stealing a kiss every so often, and you smiled as she shivered each time, thinking you'd made her hot for you. You thought her lover must have been terrible, if all it took was a kiss from a master such as yourself to make her shiver. When you'd left for Troy, she was a girl. You thought she was still a girl. You thought you'd made her into a Greek, like you. You were wrong. She lowered you into the bath, and stepped aside, watching as her lover came through the door and stabbed you, her eyes hard and cruel. You were stabbed, and you died, and you realised you'd made a mistake. She was a Spartan woman, far from home, and no man, not even you, could tame her.",

    "text": "She brought ambrosia from the north when word arrived of Ariadne's placement among the stars, carefully mending the hem of her chiton with a slim skein of golden thread. She knew how it was - and if their cases didn't entirely match she certainly understood how it goes and what it feels like, the transition from flesh to immortality, the queerness of being entirely yourself yet entirely ephemeral. Eros told her that she shouldn't fuss so. \"Let her learn for herself what it's like,\" he said, notching an arrow, testing his sigths. \"She won't be ready,\" fretted Psyche, swaddling Bliss against her milk-swollen breasts, feeling a river of emotion drip from the core of her being. \"It's not something you'd understand, beloved.\" He rested the bow upon the table between them and took her head. \"I wish it were easy for you to live in this realm.\" \"It cannot be ambrosia raining from the sky every second.\" Her nervous laughter likely telegraphed her true feelings about the matter. No matter how kind, how graceful, a mortal transposed toward immortality might be, she could never be naturally born to the throne. That was left to the goddesses surrounding her, the ones born of a thigh or a forehead or a trapped swan, those made of the divine seed of Zeus. She, meanwhile, was left to run fallow and foolish; she was a human, and knew no better way to behave. \"Ahh, but just will it and I would make it so.\" She frowned at him. Bliss hiccupped, blowing a spitbubble. \"Why should I conjure when I can create with my own hands?\" He gave her a roguish smile. \"But why create when you could blink the world into being?\" he laced his fingers through her free hand. \"You are my adored, splendid wife, but ah, you're so very mortal.\" Psyche realized that Eros could never fathom what it was to have your life warped so dramatically by fate - spoiled son of Aphrodite, he'd never lifted a finger before in his life, content to live as his mother's happy messenger of love and lust. She withdrew, her smile forced to brightness. \"A woman understands,\" she said simply, \"what a man cannot.\" *** Psyche was late greeting the girl, after all - Bliss is fussy and, in spite of her heavenly nickname, did not react with the temperate summery nature of a child her royal stature ought to. Her mother remembered too late the ambrosia she'd forgotten in the royal apartments and marched, chagrined, into the fray. Psyche tucked the baby against her breast and fought her way through the mass of gods and goddesses paying homage to the new lady of the vineyards. \"Ariadne,\" Psyche trilled, bowing, her chiton held outward in a curtsy as she cradled the fussing Bliss to her breast. \"I'm sorry for my lateness, \"she continued. \"But Bliss is teething.\" Ariadne's gray eyes lit when she saw the blonde child's face, half-hidden among the silken blankets. \"I didn't know babies could be born here.\" Dionysus' merry laugh filled the air, his arm slung around her shoulders. \"My dear innocent. Haven't you heard of Leda and Athena? I was torn myself from my father's body.\" Ariadne turned her eyes downward, mumbling an apologetic no. \"It's well enough, my treasure. You couldn't have learned much of anything while you were alone on that accursed isle.\" That unintentional stab toward Ariadne's intelligence put Psyche on the defense. \"I've heard,\" said Psyche, bring herself out of the curtsy, \"that you poisoned the Minotaur! How clever you must be to trick him to drink it down when no man before could defeat him.\" Ariadne's face turned a scarlet as her hair. \"I don't want to talk about it.\" Psyche drew back, her boisterousness disappearing. \"All right,\" she said, reaching for the girl's slim, sun-blessed fingers. Ariadne had been a woman of the wild, quite clearly so, and Psyche could imagine her among the serfs who worshiped Demeter, hauling sacks of grapes up to be pressed, kneeling at incense-scented altar by evening light. Psyche, born to be a sacrifice of beauty, had been sheltered from the heat and pampered by her parents, both of whom feared the wrath of Aphrodite as they prepared their daughter for the ultimate sacrifice. She plunged ahead instead of correcting her previous mistake. \"Would you like to visit the bath?\" \"Gods bathe?\" chirped Ariadne. Psyche grinned, slinging an arm round Ariadne's waist, hoisting Bliss against her opposing shoulder and pulling her from Dionysus' grip. \"The warmest and softest-flowing waters in all the world flow here.\" Eager to be away from the picky, jealous crowd of gods, Ariadne followed Psyche's lead and stepped through the clearing pathway. \"Psyche!\" bellowed Dionysus jovially. \"Treat her gently,\" he cautioned, but Psyche pressed her lips into a thin smile and then gave him a mock-bow, spiriting the younger woman to the safety and secluded nature of the baths. *** Ariadne's clearly-etched surprise at the lushness of the small spring delighted Psyche. Clearly the girl has never been exposed to such luxury before, her feet dipping into the warmed perfumed waters and gently paddling against the wavlets licking at her toes. The sudsy lather of triple-milled soap caked her fingertips while Psyche played hide-and-seek with Bliss, tiring the girl out on gasps and giggles before lying her down to rest among the warm safety of the dirt. All the while Ariadne watched the twosome, her chin tucked into her open palm. \"Is it really that much fun?\" she asked. \"Motherhood?\" At Ariadne's eager nod, Psyche broke into a gale of laughter. \"Oh honey, no. It's a struggle just to get her together every morning. I'm no luckier than any other Athenian that way.\" Stroking against Bliss' soft feet, she asked, \"has Dionysus spoken of children?\" Ariadne nodded quickly. \"But I haven't considered them. I'm sure it will be no trouble,\" she added wryly, \"I'm to be married to the god of ecstasy. I understand that to be a wondrous thing\" \"You haven't consummated your love?\" She pointed toward her head. \"I have not yet been crowned. It lies to Zeus to marry us, and he's busy overseeing the wars.\" They both knew that Dionysus was not the sort to wait long on pleasure; that he cared to wait at all showed the world how precious Ariadne was to him. Psyche remembered her own long trial and shuddered. \"You are different to him.\" \"Must we speak of him?\" she smiled. \"Though I love the man, there are many subjects over which to dwell. To be honest with you, I'm still getting used to their being a world outside of Naxos.\" She played nervously with the hem of her stola. Psyche reached out for the woman's chilled fingers. \"Theseus is not among the supplicants of your husband. You won't ever see him again.\" Violently, Ariadne pulled away from Psyche's touch. \"Good, for if I ever see him I shall strike him dead!\" Psyche gasped; Gods could be rash and volatile by nature, but their bursts of temper still ran counter-course to the girl's own gentleness. \"He broke my heart for many a month,\" Ariadne continued. \"Is it any wonder that I feel enmity?\" \"No,\" admitted Psyche. \"Sometimes I'm amazed I'm not angry with Eros. I had to move mountains for that boy. Let's face it, honey.\" \"They don't understand!\" cried Psyche and Ariadne simultaneously. \"Well,\" laughed Psyche. \"I guess that's why we ex-mortals have each other.\" She tucked her chin against the warm dirt of Olympus. \"What's the one thing you wished you had more time for when you were tending the Minotaur?\" \"Please don't bring him up...\" \"Well?\" \"Sewing,\" admitted Ariadne. \"Then why don't we borrow needles from Athena and get to work?\" she asked. \"Could we?\" \"Should we?\" The women grinned at one another. \"Yes!\" *** And so daily the goddesses could be seen, working on their stitchery in tandem, Ariadne crafting her own bridal gown and Psyche clothing for Bliss. They chattered happily to each other of their pasts and futures The men in their lives - completely surprised by their shared bond, though not displeased by it, didn't think to protest her work. Though it did occur to Eros to check with his sister, to avoid further nastiness in the vein of the unfortunate Arcane. \"She has made her tribute to me in full,\" explained Athena with a shrug. \"And they do not seek to outdo me, brother.\" Dionysus then pulled him away for a drink. \"It's a woman's affair,\" he said, and the two children of Zeus drank deep into their cups. *** Zeus finally returned, and the wedding of Dionysus and Ariadne was plotted and planned. The two women finally finished their projects and gathered together to dress Ariadne for her marriage. The bride was in a stormy state as Psyche attended her. \"Did you see her? Your MOTHER-in-law has come to us bearing honey cakes,\" snapped Ariadne. \"She is the mother of his children,\" observed Psyche, as if her family's tangled web of interlocking romances were a perfectly natural thing. She strung together Ariadne's under-tunic and chiton, then helped her with her diadem. Whatever words Ariadne wished to speak died in her throat. She gasped and backed away from Psyche, from the handmirror and the rich earthen objects of the bridal suite. \"The child! What is she wearing?\" The true fright and shock in her friend's voice made Psyche edgy. \"What is it?\" wondered Psyche. \"She's fine, I just dressed her in her new...\" Psyche gasped to see the pattern she'd made during their many friendly discussions. How could she have sewn a Minotaur onto the child's outfit? Ariadne was, however, in another world entirely. \"He trusted me,\" she whispered. \"trusted me with his very life and he died at my hands. It was my poison who slew him, not the sword of that foolish man!\" Ariadne shivered at Psyche's warble. \"How can you break bread with a murderer?\" Psyche gave her a crooked smile, gently embracing the trembling woman. \"My mother-in-law's killed more men than I can count. You killed a beast that had terrorized your island for years.\" \"He was my only friend.\" \"Not anymore,\" Psyche said. The woman's tears dried slowly, and Psyche dried them with the back of her hands. To both women's surprise, glittering rocks appeared upon Psyche's fingertips - she shrugged and shook them away, but they landed among the veil and diadem. \"Leave them in,\" said Ariadne. \"They give it life and sparkle. \" Then, with great feeling, she clasped Psyche's hands. \"oh please,\" Ariadne begged. \"Stand beside me as my lady of character.\" Psyche smiled; of course she would; and she didn't need to say so. The two women left hand-in-hand, their work-calloused fingers glued together with tears.",

    "text": "If there was one thing he hated more than the simple-minded mortals (so easily mislead, worse than sheep honestly), was visit from mummy dearest. Venus might be the goddess of love and beauty, but she was also the most conceited and vainest person he had the most unfortunate luck to deal with. Of course, given his field of expertise, visits from Venus were a necessary evil. At least he had the Romans to entertain him to make up for those nasty moments. It was funny how much damage what falling in love could do to anyone. The latest visit from Venus had to be the loudest fit Venus had thrown by far. If Venus wasn't perfection immortalized, he would have thrown her out unceremoniously, heavenly mother or not. As it was, Heechul was interested in seeing this latest mortal that had managed to irk his mother so. He had heard of this person's beauty of course. Symmetrical looks that seemed to be crafted straight from marble itself, add that with the mortal's kind disposition, it was not difficult to see how the people had managed to forget their worships to Venus. He just hadn't expected her visit to be this soon. \"Make that urchin fall in love with the vilest creature you can find. That is an order you hear me?!\" Heechul's ears were still ringing from the harpy's shrieking. So there he was, standing in the room of his intended victim, golden arrow poised and ready as the occupant of the room slept quietly. Looking down at his golden arrow, he saw the word Siwon slowly appeared on its body. Ah. So that was the mortal's name. Heechul crept closer to the bed, wanting to catch a glimpse of the famed beauty before he finished his task. Up close, he could understand why people would be distracted by his face. The beauty of this man was really something to behold. Heechul reached a hand out, fingers almost touching Siwon's nose when a scuffle could be heard from outside the room. Cursing at himself, Heechul quickly made his way back towards the window where he came in from. In his haste to make his escape, he had fired the arrow without a second thought and fled without checking on Siwon, knowing that the aim of his arrow was always true. It was only when he reached his quarters when he noticed the blood wound on his arm. He groaned. Falling in love with the mortal was not part of his plans. *** Ever since that first night, Heechul had visited Siwon every night without fail. He couldn't fight off the compulsion. That need, that obsession, to see Siwon every moment that he could. That need to know that man beneath that beauty almost unheard of among the mortals, both physically and mentally had become the center of his universe. Every waking moment spent away from Siwon was spent plotting the different ways to please the man. And that was an incredibly satisfying goal for Heechul. Every night, Heechul would wake Siwon with some form of pleasure. Sometimes, he kissed the mortal till he woke. Sometimes, he woke Siwon by licking and nibbling at his nipples, the nubs pert and taut, so sensitive even at the lightest touch. But most times, Heechul preferred waking Siwon by deep throating him. The moment when Siwon shook the remains of his dreams and start twisting his bed sheets mindlessly had always reassured Heechul about his prowess. That despite being trapped in a love spell of his own making, he still had control over how he wanted it. Heechul would then proceed to do whatever that had struck his fancy that day. He had tried fingering Siwon till he came (so beautiful as he fell apart). There was the time where he tongue-fucked Siwon. That one time that they had tried a sixty nine before Heechul had pinned him down the bed and rode him. But mostly, they took turn fucking each other until they were both raw from the screaming and the thrusting, bodies so well-used and abused that Heechul was almost reluctant to leave the bed as dawn approached. A good outcome from his careless mistake really. The only thing he ever asked of Siwon was that he would never try to see him. And of course, it was that one rule that the idiot mortal just had to break.",

    "text": "This was probably one of the absolute worst decisions of his very long life. Hades had always done his best to abide by the rules and laws of the Fates, respecting them no matter what, especially the ones about death as that was part of his job. He knew how precarious the balance between life and death was, knew it better than anyone else ever would. If someone was meant to die there would always be death no matter what was done. The catch with that though was that the fated person could be saved, in exchange for the life of someone else who was willing. A life for a life to keep the balance in check. As God of the Underworld part of his job was protecting the balance and he'd seen people sacrifice themselves to save their loved ones numerous time. Hades had just never thought that he would be one of those people. Dionysus was dying and no one was really sure what was going on with him or what exactly to do to help. Hades did though, or at least he knew the jist of it having, discussed the hell Dionysus' body was going through with him once. And he also knew a way to save the young God, a way the other Gods would never be able to even fathom. He had been unable to save Apollo once upon a time, not having put the pieces together fast enough, but he wasn't going to fail this time. He'd already made the exchange, now it was just time to say goodbye. Hades knocked lightly on Dionysus' bedroom door before entering, having already let himself into the Gods apartment. The younger God was sitting up in bed and he looked much better than he had the last time Hades had seen him. There was color to his face, the pale sickly sheen gone and he smiled brightly when he saw the other God and Hades returned his smile as best he could. \"How are you feeling?\" \"Honestly? Like so much better. It's weird though cause one moment I was laying here feeling like I was about to die, then bam it was all gone, all of it. I haven't felt this good in decades,\" \"I'm glad to here that,\" Hades murmured lightly in reply, smile turning more honest and slightly sad. \"Your life is a gift Dionysus, you are so amazing and you really do deserve to live,\" Dionysus' smile dropped in a heartbeat then and he gave Hades a slightly wide-eyed stare. \"Hades, what did you do?\" Hades just shook his head in response, he could already feel himself slipping. The irony that it was magically enhanced lung cancer ending it all wasn't missed on him at all. The other Gods voice rose as he started to try and get out of his bed, eyes narrowing suspiciously. \"Hades tell me...\" He flinched back when a violent coughing fit ripped through Hades, mouth gaping a bit. Hades may have been a heavy chain-smoker, but he had never coughed like that before, at least not in front of Dionysus. \"What did you do?\" \"Please be happy, for me, that's, that's all I ask,\" Hades smiled over at him again, his lips stained with blood this time. Dionysus' vision grew blurry as tears began to pool and he shut his eyes to blink them away. \"You stupid son of a-,\" When he opened his eyes again Hades was gone. He was alone.",

    "text": "Elizabeth Darcy, nee Bennett, sat at the writing table in what had once been her mother-in-law's room. She ruminated, but in a ladylike way befitting the mistress of Pemberly, on the benefits of marrying a wealthy orphan. Georgiana floated in, looking more ethereal than usual in her new dress, a true India muslin purchased in London. \"Lizzie?\" Georgiana wrapped her arms about her sister-in-law's next. \"Yes, Georgiana?\" Lizzie kissed the girl on the cheek. \"I found something odd atop the pianoforte.\" Lizzie smiled. She had left a new popular song. \"Really?\" \"Yes, you'd better come see.\" Lizzie went. The sight atop the pianoforte was arresting. A tall, slender man, clothed in a toga made of furs sat, looking about him in dismay. \"Good Madames, where are my sheep?\" \"Your sheep?\" \"Yes, I am Endymion and I have lost my sheep.\" Lizzie and Georgiana exchanged a puzzled look. \"I don't know why there would be sheep in the drawing room, Lizzie,\" said Georgiana. Lizzie admired the good breeding of Pemberly. Longbourne would have been in a shrieking uproar at the appearance of a fictional poetic shepherd. \"I do wonder what happened. Were there any tours of the house this week?\" Georgiana smiled and pulled a twinkling handkerchief out of her pocket. A very disgruntled pixie jingled indignantly. \"She says her name is Tinkerbell.\" Lizzie gnawed her lower lip. This was a puzzle. \"I'm not sure pixies can time travel, Georgiana.\" \"Thank-you, Lizzie. Perhaps I'll ask Miss Coles. She likes fairy stories.\" \"That's a good idea.\" Meanwhile, Endymion had begun to prowl around the room, looking under furniture. He was relieved. Normally young women blushed and flirted with him, but these two hardly seemed to notice he was there. In the hallway, Mr. Darcy gave a sigh that was equal parts amusement and exasperation. He and Lizzie had wagered that she could not go for two weeks without talking about a man to another woman. Thankfully, Charlotte and Mr. Collins were due the next day. Lizzie would have trouble restraining herself.",

    "text": "I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel's sake. The great affair is to move.-- Robert Louis Stevenson Most evenings, they camped somewhere away from the highway or whatever back road they'd been making their way down. Steve built a fire and they shared a simple dinner, and then Orpheus pulled out his guitar, resting back against a log or a stone or one of their packs and played, and Steve settled close to him with his sketchpad across his lap, pencil in hand. Sometimes he sketched their surroundings, sun setting over deserts or plains or mountains or lakes, but mostly he sketched Orpheus, the furrow of his brow as he teased out a melody, the play of firelight and shadow across his face, his steadily thickening beard. There was still too much melancholy in the music for Steve's liking, but it did seem to be getting better. He wondered for a while if this were really true or if he was simply hearing what he wanted to hear, but then he started flipping through his sketches and he noticed the change there as well. There was a little less furrowing, a little more peace, and Steve realized that Orpheus' music affected his drawing. Art calling to art. And if his sketches were a little darker than they once had been, Orpheus' music was a little lighter, and that seemed like a fair trade to him. *** He hadn't been quite ready for the animals. It was one thing to watch Orpheus charm a pillow into plumping itself or hum the rain away from them as they rode. It was quite another to be sitting under a tree and watch as Orpheus sang a quiet, simple melody to a sparrow as it hopped its way closer, settling happily on Orpheus' knee, or to stare in amazement as squirrel after squirrel brought them nuts until they had a small pile all because Orpheus had strummed out a nut-sharing song. The best, though, was when they stopped at the National Butterfly Center, and Steve stood, astonished, arms out, as Orpheus hummed an almost inaudible tune until Steve's arms and shoulders and chest and hair were covered in butterflies, all calmly twitching their wings, as content as Steve was to sit and listen to Orpheus' song. (Best of all was the way Orpheus laughed, his face open and happy, sending the butterflies scurrying off again, filling their absence with his presence, arms curling around Steve's waist as he leaned in for a kiss Steve was only too happy to supply.) *** The thing he hadn't expected, the thing that made his chest tighten in a way that he was unsure if it was happy or sad, the thing that made him hope and despair in equal measure, was the children. He had thought Orpheus would be awkward around children, not wanting them himself. He'd thought Orpheus would avoid them or brush them aside or tense up around them. It wasn't the sort of thing that came up often, of course. They were mostly on their own, or if they were around children, it was only incidental. School groups at museums or zoos or parks. They did, on occasion, get people asking for autographs or pictures. Not just from Orpheus, which Steve had been expecting, but also from Steve, who was often asked if he was \"that Steve\" and what he thought of his song. (\"I guess I am,\" he'd say, smiling sheepishly. \"And I think it's really something.\") All of that he'd been expecting. He hadn't been expecting the day they'd hiked to a little picnic spot by a lake and a small girl had come over to Orpheus with a daisy in her hand. Nor had he been expecting Orpheus to smile and lean forward and duck his head so she could weave it into his hair. And he certainly hadn't expected Orpheus to press a kiss to her forehead and whisper something in Ancient Greek before sending her off. When he noticed Steve staring, Orpheus just smiled and shook his head and said, \"The children of Apollo find their way all over the world.\" \"And then they find you,\" Steve said, and Orpheus nodded and smiled again, closing his eyes as he leaned back, turning his face up to the sun. *** In Chicago there was a Greek family who inexplicably invite them for dinner and then to stay the night. After breakfast, Steve found Orpheus in the back yard with the little boy, not older than five or six, both of them sitting cross-legged on the grass, guitars in laps, as Orpheus modeled a simple, four-note tune, and the boy echoed it, concentration wrinkling his forehead. Orpheus laughed when the boy got it right, and then he looked up at Steve and smiled, and something in Steve's chest tightened and then loosened, and he smiled back, though he couldn't say precisely why. *** At a fruit stand at the side of the highway, Steve looked through crates of berries, turning to ask Orpheus if he preferred raspberries or blackberries, but Orpheus was nowhere to be seen. He wandered a bit further, toward the back of the stand. There was music in the air, several voices singing, and Steve followed its trail to a dusty lot behind the stand where Orpheus was spinning circles with a tiny girl who clung tightly to his hands, a ring of children around them singing a simple rhyme in Spanish while their abuelita watched from her chair, nodding along with the tune. (They were invited for dinner there too. And to stay the night. And for one of the girls' quinceaneras the next night.) *** Steve wanted to ask about it, ask about children and Orpheus and why he didn't want them in his life when he was so good with them, when they made him smile like they did, but he couldn't find the words or the time, and they just kept heading west, miles falling under the tires and days passing in a long, pleasant blur of diners and campsites and cheap motels and the occasional autograph or invitation or blessing, and eventually they were at the ocean again, in Oregon, rather than California. Orpheus had insisted and said they could head down the coast later, but the ocean felt like the ending of this trip. Especially when Orpheus guided him up a gravel road, into the lush forest, to a house built into a tree. There was a trail that led down to a small dock from there, a sailboat tethered in the water. \"Is this your home?\" Steve asked, finding it odd to think of Orpheus out here so far away from people, in this wide, spacious home rather than his cramped, Parisian flat, mere blocks from Notre Dame. And then Orpheus turned to him with a smile and said, \"I think it might be now.\" It wasn't an answer, and it wasn't an ending, but it was enough for now, and everything else would come from that.",

    "text": "Ernie drove through the first night. He drove like he hated the car from the bonnet down to the axels, as well as everyone in it and in its way. Percy found himself clutching his side of the vehicle and damn near shrieking through his teeth several times at every near miss or brush with death. Theodora, somehow, managed to remain folded up in the backseat and sleep through all of Ernie's driving, besides the impromptu performance Percy was giving her. \"She's travelled with me before,\" was all the explanation Ernie gave, offering Percy a swig from his hip flask with one hand and steering haphazardly with the other. Theodora slept right up until Ernie stopped the car in the early morning by the side of a field, leapt out of the vehicle and over the fence before Percy could ask what was wrong and set off across the grass with a whoop. And at a hell of a pace, too. Percy was still staring after him when the sister started unfolding herself from the car and he had to shut his mouth quick. Theodora was a big woman. He'd never known that from the few photos he'd seen of her: she was always shot head and shoulders, or if it was a full photo she was always standing alone with no one to compare her great height to. He wondered if she looked quite so tall in normal women's clothes; the trousers only emphasised her long legs and the hat she was putting on right now probably added an extra few inches. He watched her walk a little way off, groan and stretch with the tiniest of creaks. She even moved like a man, he found himself noticing. There was no unconscious sway of her hips, no little steps that women had to take in their heeled shoes but a proper stride. From behind she'd fool anyone. And, he thought as she turned to walk back, she'd probably be able to manage it from the front too, at a distance. The way the shirt hung on her suggested she didn't have much of anything in the way of hips or breasts, and the rolled up sleeves served to show how thick her arms were. He looked away before she could think he was staring at her, shut up some part of his brain that was screaming that he'd been ogling his new half-sister for god's sake what's wrong with you, and turned back to watch the speck that was Ernie. Damn, that guy could run! \"I've got to ask,\" he managed, \"what's up with him?\" \"Ernie's always preferred wide open spaces to the city.\" She'd reached the car by now, not bothering to look in the direction her brother was speeding but reaching in through the still open door. \"He was born and bred in the countryside. He pretends to like staying put for Zach, but I reckon he's only truly happy when he's on the move. He never could stand to be cooped up.\" Percy looked from her back to Ernie's far off shape. There was something about the man's speed that just drew his eyes back time and again. \"Yeah, alright, I get that...but why the running?\" She looked up from the thing she'd pulled out of her jacket as she slammed the door. \"As I said, he's on the move. He had to be very quick on his feet when he was a child, now he misses it. There's not a lot of places he can let loose in the city.\" She held out the thing - a cigarette case - to him. Percy considered refusing, but it'd been a long time in between smokes and he'd surely never taste anything this expensive again - so, alright, he nodded. He even accepted a light for the thing. They smoked in silence and she blew smoke rings. God, even her smoke rings were perfect. Her hands, looking back on his evaluation, might give the game away after all; they were big but slender and obviously female. She'd have to wear gloves to complete the illusion. \"How long have you known about me?\" he made himself ask. She finished the latest ring. \"Phoh. Officially? Since Zach sent for us yesterday morning and told us about your damn fool bet. Don't look at me like that,\" she added, even though she could barely have caught a glimpse of his glare before he stopped it. \"It was a stupid wager, and you know it. Unofficially - well.\" She blew another ring. \"I can't speak for Ernie, but I found out a few years back, now. Ever since he,\" she jabbed a thumb at her brother's far off form, \"and Ollie and Tessa showed up, I've developed an interest in what - our father-\" She glared at him now, perhaps daring him to point out that she'd clearly been about to say 'my father'. Percy kept his mouth buttoned tight and blew the smoke out of his nose instead. She sighed, and went on. \"What he gets up to, who he spends his time with and who he leaves behind. But I wasn't deliberately looking for you. One day I found a letter in Zach's desk, from your mother. She'd worked out who he was by then. I mean, he's been in the papers often enough. She was smart enough not to try and blackmail him. She made it clear she wasn't asking for money, she was doing fine, she just wanted to tell him about you.\" \"Me?\" His mother, doing something like that...she'd known, she'd known all along and she never told him, she told that guy all about him but she didn't even have the decency to do the same for her own son... \"What about me?\" \"Many things.\" She twirled her wrist as she elaborated, leaving spirals of smoke. \"Your name, how old you were, how you were so bright and doing so well in school. She said she enclosed a picture but I couldn't find it, Zach must have taken it with him. I actually passed through your neighbourhood a couple of times since then, I suppose-\" She actually smiled, she fucking smiled, shaking her head. \"I suppose I was trying to catch a glimpse of my latest sibling. Or...I'd seen how he treated Harriet; I've kept an eye on how he treats the mothers of his other children. But last night was the first time I ever actually laid eyes on her, or on you.\" Percy looked at her, a woman who'd been well fed enough to reach the full height her heritage had granted her, wearing old men's clothes but smoking her expensive cigarette. \"You knew about me. All that time, you knew. Dammit, you could have done something, you could've fucking helped us-\" \"No. I couldn't have.\" He hadn't noticed until now how soft her eyes were getting until they became rock hard once more. She brought the cigarette nearly to her lips again, seemed disgusted with it all of a sudden and threw it to the dirt only half smoked, straightened up and strode away. Theodora drove for the rest of the morning while Ernie snored in the backseat. She drove calm and straight with hardly a bump and barely took her eyes off the road in five hours, from what Percy could tell. When Ernie woke up and declared he was starving he opened up the hamper and passed around sandwiches and soda, although the soda was unpleasantly warm, and then a bag of candy. They stopped once or twice for a restroom break. Theodora, naturally, walked far off each time to take care of her own business. The second time it was Ernie who leaned against the car beside him and waited for the third member of the group to come back. Ernie didn't smoke at all - \"Bad for my lungs,\" he said, thumping his chest - but he still had cigarettes to offer. Where Theodora was tall, Ernie was short. He'd taken great delight in stringing Percy along last night before telling him his actual age, but come on - how was he supposed to know that the 'kid' was actually six years older than him? His suit looked much newer than his half-sister's, and expensive too. It also looked like he hadn't taken it off for days and yet somehow it still managed to be stylish. \"Did you know about me?\" Percy asked him. \"No, but I wasn't exactly surprised when Zach told us. There's an awful lot of us illegitimates showing up these days. You're eighteen, right?\" He grinned when Percy indicated that, yeah, he had turned eighteen a little while back, right enough. \"You'd probably have been invited to join the Family soon anyway.\" \"I thought Zachariah had decided not to adopt any more of his bastard children?\" Percy said, stubbing out the cigarette on a fence post. The press had had a field day with that one, after the public rows between man and wife. \"Yep,\" Ernie said, with the shit-eating grin of one long acknowledged and favoured, even by the dreaded Harriet. Percy had heard the rumours that she liked him more than her own sons, although admittedly that didn't sound like a very difficult thing to accomplish. \"But put it this way: if you manage to pull this off, come back a hero? You'll be brought into the...middle circle, shall we say? Not officially the Family, but no one'll ever be able to touch you again. Not even the higher ups. That's the compromise Zachariah made with Harriet, after what happened to Edouarde.\" Percy had also heard rumours about that particular Edouarde, the owner of the Bacchanal. Rumours that didn't paint the Family matriarch in a very good light. Looking back on Theodora's attitude, he reckoned he could understand it a bit more; she may have thought it better for him to remain unacknowledged if that also meant being out of the sight of Harriet. But still... \"It's just as well you agreed to this wager,\" Ernie went on, pushing himself upright and shading his eyes. Percy turned to see Theodora wending her slow way back to them, taking her time to look around at the lay of the land. \"Really? Your sister seems to think it a damn fool one.\" \"Thea's right,\" Ernie told him, actually losing the smile for once. \"Even with our help, which you desperately need, it could go wrong. Really wrong. But, see, that's the point; you do this, you bring back proof - that's your rite of passage, that's your ticket into the Family. If you hadn't made the bet, they'd just have found something else for you to do. Something worse.\" Percy thought about this. \"So, now anyone who wants to get acknowledged, they're not just accepted...they have to do some crazy shit like this?\" \"Oh, yeah.\" \"That's...that's pretty fucked up, Ernie.\" \"That's the Family, little brother.\" Ernie cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted to his sister, asking if he should drive for the afternoon. They hid the car quite thoroughly in the trees near the bank before they stepped on board. Ernie was far better with the boat than he was with the car, and they were soon cruising down the river at a fair speed without making Percy clutch the side in ill-disguised terror. Theodora spent most of the evening lying on the bed in the cabin with a bowl on the floor for her to throw up in. When they moored for the night she refused to eat anything, scowling as they finished off the sandwiches and Ernie made a deliberate show of enjoying them. Eventually he turned concerned and crouched by the bed to hold a cigarette to her lips, dabbing her forehead with his free hand and whispering things to her. Percy sat on the other side of the cabin on the blanket he'd laid out and just watched them, sucking a piece of candy. He wondered if either of them had had the comfort of their mother at their bedside when they were sick, and figured probably not. Rich people did things differently, they left that kind of thing to nannies. And anyway, Thea's mother had died when she was very little, hadn't she? He remembered reading something about it, ages ago. \"Thea, we should tell him,\" Ernie was saying. \"No. No, I don't want to,\" she said, weak after all her throwing up. She sounded younger, almost like the sick little girl Percy had imagined. She pushed Ernie's hand away but he moved it right back, cupping her chin. \"Thea, come on. He's going to learn anyway, it might as well be now.\" \"No, Ernie, it really doesn't have to be now.\" \"You know it does.\" \"You just like seeing me as uncomfortable as possible, don't you, you little shit?\" But she was smiling now and her voice was less girly, more amused. \"Of course.\" Ernie was smiling again as he slid an arm under her shoulders, with some work. \"I mean, how long has it been since something was actually your fault?\" \"Not long enough.\" Theodora pushed herself up with his help and took the cigarette in her own hand, settling her back against the cabin wall and meeting Percy's eyes. \"All right, then. Percy. Zach sent us to help you with this mission to bring back 'that whore slut Mizz Lucy's head' for Mister Paulo, because it was pretty clear you'd never manage it on your own.\" \"Thanks,\" Percy said, crunching candy. \"But, I also agreed to help because...lord.\" She rubbed sweat from her forehead and tried again. \"Because, like Ernie said, this is my fault. Why she is the way she is. If I can't clean up my own mess, I can at least help you to do it.\" \"Your fault?\" Of all of the Family, Theodora was by far the last one of them he would expect to have any connection with 'Mizz Lucy'. \"How does that work?\" \"She was my secretary, about five years back. Before...\" She sighed and blew out a river of smoke. \"She was a good worker, conscientious and professional and, oh, everything I could wish for. I knew she had two younger sisters to support - the parents were dead, they died in the flu epidemic - so I paid her extra, and she earned it. Then, one evening a few days before Christmas, we were catching up on some work in my office in the main house, Zach called me down to the party for a few minutes to make a good show, so I left Lucy to it.\" The woman sighed, running her fingers through her sweaty hair. \"When I came back, I found-\" \"Mizz Lucy and dear old Uncle Simon,\" Ernie said from his seat on the floor, clearly grinning despite himself, \"with him hiking her up against one wall, and both of them quite busy fucking each other's brains out.\" Percy whistled, high to low. \"Doesn't sound like there was much for them to be fucking out in the first place. I mean-\" \"My uncle and I don't get on,\" Theodora cut in, clenching the blanket with her free hand so hard the knuckle turned white. All of her had gone pale, not just from the travel sickness. \"We never have. I told him to get out of the house, now, and if he didn't I'd tell his wife why. He went. Then I started on Lucy. She broke down and it turned out this had been going on for the better part of two months. She passed on a lot of information that...\" She wiped her forehead again. She sucked on the cigarette for far too long, and breathed out more smoke than it seemed possible for a human body to hold. \"I have a bad temper. I said a lot of things I regret now. I told her to get out too, she was fired. When she protested I threw a lamp at her and called the servants to throw her out, not just out of the house but off the grounds. She barely had time to grab her coat.\" The free hand was worrying the blanket, picking and pulling at it. \"I assumed, and I suppose Lucy did too, otherwise she'd not have gone so easy in the end, that Simon was waiting for her and would take her with him. We both thought wrong. And it was starting to snow.\" Percy had been caught outside in the snow, once, and that had been with all the protection a concerned mother had been able to knit for her son. How much protection could a single coat give? \"She made it through the night, though.\" \"She paid for it. Frostbite. Cost her at least two of her toes, a little finger, but it was her face that was the real blow. She had some reason to be proud of it, before.\" God only knew what Theodora was really seeing now, with those big grey eyes wreathed in the smoke of her cigarette. \"She lost pretty much all of her nose, part of her lips.\" \"All this is what we learned afterwards,\" Ernie said, at last deciding to relieve his sister. \"In the following days, when everyone had calmed down, we tried to track her down, offer her something in the way of compensation. But she'd disappeared. Just took her sisters and upped and vanished, the rent unpaid and everything. And that was the last we heard of Mizz Lucy - until the news came from Kisthene this spring.\" \"And now I've said I'll kill her,\" he muttered. He felt sick. He'd thought this strange woman, this 'whore slut' encroaching on Paulo's business, would be just like him, just as small and petty and mean and no one would miss her. He'd thought, and he'd known nothing. \"You have to,\" Theodora said, sucking with desperation on the last of her smoke. \"You'd be doing her a favour, Percy. She's crazy. Insane. Some of the things I've found out, you think they can't be true but they are. She's gone mad. There's nothing anyone can do for her, except to put her out of her misery. Even if it has to be you who does it, and not me.\" * They moored the boat on the fourth morning, walked all day and somehow ended up inside a pretty large estate - \"Ah, beautiful Hesperides!\" Ernie sang out - as dusk began to roll in. Percy wondered if they should be here, and wondered even more as they walked up to the grand old house, out of which was spilling - girls. A whole lot of beautiful, black girls. Ernie was almost carried on a wave of plump arms into the house, laughing and shouting. Thea made her own way to the front door unmolested but actually smiling for a change, leaving him to trail behind and constantly look over his shoulder at the fabulous gardens they were leaving outside. The house was just as sumptuous inside and filled with flowers everywhere. Fake silk ones shared the same vases as the ones cut and taken from the gardens, every piece of furniture seemed to be carved with them, they were in every picture on the walls and they filled all the spaces in between the dark whirlwind as the girls sat them down and fetched them food and booze. Percy must have been introduced to some of them at some point but they really all meshed together, grinning and eating with their fingers and knocking back their home brewed hooch. He'd never been around black people this...exuberant, before. He was pretty sure they were enjoying his not-knowing-what-the-fuck-to-think-of-all-this expression, and he did honestly try to get it off his face but...really? A group of black girls, owning a house like this? Of course, they didn't own it, not officially, as Thea told him when he escaped to the veranda. \"On paper it's Harriet's property, but she never comes here anymore. She lets them live here free of charge, and no one can touch them.\" Percy struggled to join up the two pictures, the literal wicked stepmother that his father and, presumably, his step-sister had hidden him from, and the generous benefactor who let all these women stay from the goodness of her heart. Of course, no one was all one thing. Except for Paulo; he was rotten to the core. \"We told you,\" Thea said, as business-like as if she'd never been boat sick for a day and a half, \"that first night, that we'd help you win this stupid bet. Well, we've been talking to the girls and they can help us further. They don't know precisely where Lucy is hiding, but,\" she went on, raising her finger to stop his words, \"they know of someone who does. They'll take you to them tomorrow. I should warn you, though, you may have to get rough. Your hosts won't be very cooperative.\" \"I'll keep that in mind.\" \"Once you've learned her location,\" she went on, looking out over the dark gardens, \"we'll give you the things you'll need. Also, it might help if you ask the girls if you can borrow their ice box for the journey back home. They keep a small one for picnics. It should be just the right size.\" \"I'll do that,\" he said, embarrassed that he hadn't even considered how he'd get a severed head back home in the height of summer, without it starting to rot. Yet another thing he hadn't thought through when he'd agreed to Paulo's wager. It was just as well he had Thea to think for him. He stood and watched her smoke. After four days of increasingly sweaty men's clothes it was as much a shock to see her wearing a dress - and actually wearing it well, even if it was rather short on her - as her original getup had been. She moved like a woman now, even smoked like one, and she'd done something to her hair so there was more of it. Nothing much had changed, apart from the clothes, and yet everything had changed. And still, somehow, she managed to be the same person, whatever clothes she was wearing and whatever gender she appeared to be, if only at a distance. \"What are you two doing out here?\" Ernie asked, pouring himself out onto the veranda as well. \"You're missing all the fun!\" \"Seems like you're having enough fun for both of us,\" he replied, and then started as Ernie slung an arm around his neck. \"Get off, you're heavy,\" he said, half-heartedly, but he slung his own arm around Ernie's waist and accepted the glass shoved at him. For home brew, it was pretty good; they had the advantage of having actual fruit to distil. \"Hey, Thea, I was thinking, we should bring the girls up to the city; they'd have a ball at Edouarde's place!\" \"Harriet wouldn't be pleased.\" \"I know; Edouarde'll love it!\" Thea smiled at that, but she still shook her head. \"Oh, come on, Sophie, it'll be great, you know it! They never get to go anywhere!\" \"Maybe they're happy here, away from the city?\" That cut Ernie off. He muttered and sat down all at once, pulling Percy down after him. \"And don't drink too much, I need you sober to send a message in the morning, tell Zach we've arrived.\" \"Oh, Sophie-\" \"And you need to start making plans with Percy about how he's actually going to pull this off without getting killed.\" Ernie actually stuck his tongue out at her. \"You're a horrible sister.\" Thea just laughed, strode down the steps and into the garden. \"She isn't really,\" he went on, turning to look Percy in the eye, \"she's my favourite.\" \"I believe you. I really do.\" \"You'd better.\" Ernie tossed back the last of his hooch and licked his lips. \"Word of advice. Whatever plan you cook up, to get into Mizz Lucy's lair? It might be better if you leave Thea out of that bit.\" Just like Thea, he raised a finger to stop Percy speaking, this time about how stupid that was. \"I know, she's come all this way to help you and trust me, she can take care of herself, but seriously? She gets injured, even a scratch, Zach'll flip. He adores her. She's his golden girl.\" To Ernie's credit, he only sounded the tiniest bit bitter, because after all he loved her too. \"He won't take too kindly to you, if his favourite daughter gets maimed on this quest of yours.\" \"I should think that's up to Thea, not me,\" he replied, finishing off the last of his drink as well. \"And if he's so concerned, he shouldn't have let her go.\" And he should have loved all his children equally, not one above all the others, even if that one was Thea. He watched her shape as she moved further into the garden, drifting a grey river behind her, and felt he was beginning to understand why - in her photos - she was always alone.",

      "Theodora slept right up until Ernie stopped the car in the early morning by the side of a field, leapt out of the vehicle and over the fence before Percy could ask what was wrong and set off across the grass with a whoop.",
      "And at a hell of a pace, too.",
      "Percy was still staring after him when the sister started unfolding herself from the car and he had to shut his mouth quick.",
      "Theodora was a big woman.",
      "He'd never known that from the few photos he'd seen of her: she was always shot head and shoulders, or if it was a full photo she was always standing alone with no one to compare her great height to.",
      "He wondered if she looked quite so tall in normal women's clothes; the trousers only emphasised her long legs and the hat she was putting on right now probably added an extra few inches.",

      "The way the shirt hung on her suggested she didn't have much of anything in the way of hips or breasts, and the rolled up sleeves served to show how thick her arms were.",
      "He looked away before she could think he was staring at her, shut up some part of his brain that was screaming that he'd been ogling his new half-sister for god's sake what's wrong with you, and turned back to watch the speck that was Ernie.",

      "She held out the thing - a cigarette case - to him.",
      "Percy considered refusing, but it'd been a long time in between smokes and he'd surely never taste anything this expensive again - so, alright, he nodded.",
      "He even accepted a light for the thing.",
      "They smoked in silence and she blew smoke rings.",
      "God, even her smoke rings were perfect.",
      "Her hands, looking back on his evaluation, might give the game away after all; they were big but slender and obviously female.",
      "She'd have to wear gloves to complete the illusion.",

      "Unofficially - well.\"",
      "She blew another ring.",
      "\"I can't speak for Ernie, but I found out a few years back, now.",
      "Ever since he,\" she jabbed a thumb at her brother's far off form, \"and Ollie and Tessa showed up, I've developed an interest in what - our father-\" She glared at him now, perhaps daring him to point out that she'd clearly been about to say 'my father'.",

      "\"Many things.\"",

      "But last night was the first time I ever actually laid eyes on her, or on you.\"",
      "Percy looked at her, a woman who'd been well fed enough to reach the full height her heritage had granted her, wearing old men's clothes but smoking her expensive cigarette.",
      "\"You knew about me.",
      "All that time, you knew.",
      "Dammit, you could have done something, you could've fucking helped us-\" \"No. I couldn't have.\"",
      "He hadn't noticed until now how soft her eyes were getting until they became rock hard once more.",
      "She brought the cigarette nearly to her lips again, seemed disgusted with it all of a sudden and threw it to the dirt only half smoked, straightened up and strode away.",
      "Theodora drove for the rest of the morning while Ernie snored in the backseat.",
      "She drove calm and straight with hardly a bump and barely took her eyes off the road in five hours, from what Percy could tell.",
      "When Ernie woke up and declared he was starving he opened up the hamper and passed around sandwiches and soda, although the soda was unpleasantly warm, and then a bag of candy.",
      "They stopped once or twice for a restroom break.",
      "Theodora, naturally, walked far off each time to take care of her own business.",
      "The second time it was Ernie who leaned against the car beside him and waited for the third member of the group to come back.",
      "Ernie didn't smoke at all - \"Bad for my lungs,\" he said, thumping his chest - but he still had cigarettes to offer.",
      "Where Theodora was tall, Ernie was short.",
      "He'd taken great delight in stringing Percy along last night before telling him his actual age, but come on - how was he supposed to know that the 'kid' was actually six years older than him?",
      "His suit looked much newer than his half-sister's, and expensive too.",
      "It also looked like he hadn't taken it off for days and yet somehow it still managed to be stylish.",
      "\"Did you know about me?\" Percy asked him.",
      "\"No, but I wasn't exactly surprised when Zach told us.",
      "There's an awful lot of us illegitimates showing up these days.",
      "You're eighteen, right?\"",
      "He grinned when Percy indicated that, yeah, he had turned eighteen a little while back, right enough.",
      "\"You'd probably have been invited to join the Family soon anyway.\"",
      "\"I thought Zachariah had decided not to adopt any more of his bastard children?\" Percy said, stubbing out the cigarette on a fence post.",
      "The press had had a field day with that one, after the public rows between man and wife.",
      "\"Yep,\" Ernie said, with the shit-eating grin of one long acknowledged and favoured, even by the dreaded Harriet.",
      "Percy had heard the rumours that she liked him more than her own sons, although admittedly that didn't sound like a very difficult thing to accomplish.",
      "\"But put it this way: if you manage to pull this off, come back a hero?",
      "You'll be brought into the...middle circle, shall we say?",
      "Not officially the Family, but no one'll ever be able to touch you again.",
      "Not even the higher ups.",
      "That's the compromise Zachariah made with Harriet, after what happened to Edouarde.\"",
      "Percy had also heard rumours about that particular Edouarde, the owner of the Bacchanal.",
      "Rumours that didn't paint the Family matriarch in a very good light.",
      "Looking back on Theodora's attitude, he reckoned he could understand it a bit more; she may have thought it better for him to remain unacknowledged if that also meant being out of the sight of Harriet.",
      "But still...",
      "\"It's just as well you agreed to this wager,\" Ernie went on, pushing himself upright and shading his eyes.",
      "Percy turned to see Theodora wending her slow way back to them, taking her time to look around at the lay of the land.",
      "\"Really?",
      "Your sister seems to think it a damn fool one.\"",
      "\"Thea's right,\" Ernie told him, actually losing the smile for once.",
      "\"Even with our help, which you desperately need, it could go wrong.",
      "Really wrong.",
      "But, see, that's the point; you do this, you bring back proof - that's your rite of passage, that's your ticket into the Family.",
      "If you hadn't made the bet, they'd just have found something else for you to do.",
      "Something worse.\"",
      "Percy thought about this.",
      "\"So, now anyone who wants to get acknowledged, they're not just accepted...they have to do some crazy shit like this?\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah.\"",
      "\"That's...that's pretty fucked up, Ernie.\"",
      "\"That's the Family, little brother.\"",
      "Ernie cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted to his sister, asking if he should drive for the afternoon.",
      "They hid the car quite thoroughly in the trees near the bank before they stepped on board.",
      "Ernie was far better with the boat than he was with the car, and they were soon cruising down the river at a fair speed without making Percy clutch the side in ill-disguised terror.",
      "Theodora spent most of the evening lying on the bed in the cabin with a bowl on the floor for her to throw up in.",
      "When they moored for the night she refused to eat anything, scowling as they finished off the sandwiches and Ernie made a deliberate show of enjoying them.",
      "Eventually he turned concerned and crouched by the bed to hold a cigarette to her lips, dabbing her forehead with his free hand and whispering things to her.",
      "Percy sat on the other side of the cabin on the blanket he'd laid out and just watched them, sucking a piece of candy.",
      "He wondered if either of them had had the comfort of their mother at their bedside when they were sick, and figured probably not.",
      "Rich people did things differently, they left that kind of thing to nannies.",
      "And anyway, Thea's mother had died when she was very little, hadn't she?",
      "He remembered reading something about it, ages ago.",
      "\"Thea, we should tell him,\" Ernie was saying.",
      "\"No.",
      "No, I don't want to,\" she said, weak after all her throwing up.",
      "She sounded younger, almost like the sick little girl Percy had imagined.",
      "She pushed Ernie's hand away but he moved it right back, cupping her chin.",
      "\"Thea, come on.",
      "He's going to learn anyway, it might as well be now.\"",
      "\"No, Ernie, it really doesn't have to be now.\"",
      "\"You know it does.\"",
      "\"You just like seeing me as uncomfortable as possible, don't you, you little shit?\"",
      "But she was smiling now and her voice was less girly, more amused.",
      "\"Of course.\"",
      "Ernie was smiling again as he slid an arm under her shoulders, with some work.",
      "\"I mean, how long has it been since something was actually your fault?\"",
      "\"Not long enough.\"",
      "Theodora pushed herself up with his help and took the cigarette in her own hand, settling her back against the cabin wall and meeting Percy's eyes.",
      "\"All right, then.",
      "Percy.",
      "Zach sent us to help you with this mission to bring back 'that whore slut Mizz Lucy's head' for Mister Paulo, because it was pretty clear you'd never manage it on your own.\"",
      "\"Thanks,\" Percy said, crunching candy.",
      "\"But, I also agreed to help because...lord.\"",
      "She rubbed sweat from her forehead and tried again.",
      "\"Because, like Ernie said, this is my fault.",
      "Why she is the way she is.",
      "If I can't clean up my own mess, I can at least help you to do it.\"",
      "\"Your fault?\" Of all of the Family, Theodora was by far the last one of them he would expect to have any connection with 'Mizz Lucy'.",
      "\"How does that work?\"",
      "\"She was my secretary, about five years back.",
      "Before...\" She sighed and blew out a river of smoke.",
      "\"She was a good worker, conscientious and professional and, oh, everything I could wish for.",
      "I knew she had two younger sisters to support - the parents were dead, they died in the flu epidemic - so I paid her extra, and she earned it.",
      "Then, one evening a few days before Christmas, we were catching up on some work in my office in the main house, Zach called me down to the party for a few minutes to make a good show, so I left Lucy to it.\"",
      "The woman sighed, running her fingers through her sweaty hair.",
      "\"When I came back, I found-\" \"Mizz Lucy and dear old Uncle Simon,\" Ernie said from his seat on the floor, clearly grinning despite himself, \"with him hiking her up against one wall, and both of them quite busy fucking each other's brains out.\"",
      "Percy whistled, high to low.",
      "\"Doesn't sound like there was much for them to be fucking out in the first place.",
      "I mean-\" \"My uncle and I don't get on,\" Theodora cut in, clenching the blanket with her free hand so hard the knuckle turned white.",
      "All of her had gone pale, not just from the travel sickness.",
      "\"We never have.",
      "I told him to get out of the house, now, and if he didn't I'd tell his wife why.",
      "He went.",

      "She sucked on the cigarette for far too long, and breathed out more smoke than it seemed possible for a human body to hold.",
      "\"I have a bad temper.",
      "I said a lot of things I regret now.",
      "I told her to get out too, she was fired.",
      "When she protested I threw a lamp at her and called the servants to throw her out, not just out of the house but off the grounds.",
      "She barely had time to grab her coat.\"",
      "The free hand was worrying the blanket, picking and pulling at it.",
      "\"I assumed, and I suppose Lucy did too, otherwise she'd not have gone so easy in the end, that Simon was waiting for her and would take her with him.",
      "We both thought wrong.",
      "And it was starting to snow.\"",
      "Percy had been caught outside in the snow, once, and that had been with all the protection a concerned mother had been able to knit for her son.",

      "\"She paid for it.",

      "\"Once you've learned her location,\" she went on, looking out over the dark gardens, \"we'll give you the things you'll need.",
      "Also, it might help if you ask the girls if you can borrow their ice box for the journey back home.",
      "They keep a small one for picnics.",
      "It should be just the right size.\"",
      "\"I'll do that,\" he said, embarrassed that he hadn't even considered how he'd get a severed head back home in the height of summer, without it starting to rot.",
      "Yet another thing he hadn't thought through when he'd agreed to Paulo's wager.",
      "It was just as well he had Thea to think for him.",
      "He stood and watched her smoke.",
      "After four days of increasingly sweaty men's clothes it was as much a shock to see her wearing a dress - and actually wearing it well, even if it was rather short on her - as her original getup had been.",
      "She moved like a woman now, even smoked like one, and she'd done something to her hair so there was more of it.",
      "Nothing much had changed, apart from the clothes, and yet everything had changed.",
      "And still, somehow, she managed to be the same person, whatever clothes she was wearing and whatever gender she appeared to be, if only at a distance.",
      "\"What are you two doing out here?\" Ernie asked, pouring himself out onto the veranda as well.",
      "\"You're missing all the fun!\"",
      "\"Seems like you're having enough fun for both of us,\" he replied, and then started as Ernie slung an arm around his neck.",
      "\"Get off, you're heavy,\" he said, half-heartedly, but he slung his own arm around Ernie's waist and accepted the glass shoved at him.",
      "For home brew, it was pretty good; they had the advantage of having actual fruit to distil.",
      "\"Hey, Thea, I was thinking, we should bring the girls up to the city; they'd have a ball at Edouarde's place!\"",
      "\"Harriet wouldn't be pleased.\"",
      "\"I know; Edouarde'll love it!\"",
      "Thea smiled at that, but she still shook her head.",
      "\"Oh, come on, Sophie, it'll be great, you know it!",
      "They never get to go anywhere!\"",
      "\"Maybe they're happy here, away from the city?\"",
      "That cut Ernie off.",
      "He muttered and sat down all at once, pulling Percy down after him.",
      "\"And don't drink too much, I need you sober to send a message in the morning, tell Zach we've arrived.\"",
      "\"Oh, Sophie-\" \"And you need to start making plans with Percy about how he's actually going to pull this off without getting killed.\"",
      "Ernie actually stuck his tongue out at her.",
      "\"You're a horrible sister.\"",
      "Thea just laughed, strode down the steps and into the garden.",
      "\"She isn't really,\" he went on, turning to look Percy in the eye, \"she's my favourite.\"",
      "\"I believe you.",
      "I really do.\"",
      "\"You'd better.\"",
      "Ernie tossed back the last of his hooch and licked his lips.",
      "\"Word of advice.",
      "Whatever plan you cook up, to get into Mizz Lucy's lair?",
      "It might be better if you leave Thea out of that bit.\"",
      "Just like Thea, he raised a finger to stop Percy speaking, this time about how stupid that was.",
      "\"I know, she's come all this way to help you and trust me, she can take care of herself, but seriously?",
      "She gets injured, even a scratch, Zach'll flip.",
      "He adores her.",
      "She's his golden girl.\"",
      "To Ernie's credit, he only sounded the tiniest bit bitter, because after all he loved her too.",
      "\"He won't take too kindly to you, if his favourite daughter gets maimed on this quest of yours.\"",
      "\"I should think that's up to Thea, not me,\" he replied, finishing off the last of his drink as well.",
      "\"And if he's so concerned, he shouldn't have let her go.\"",
      "And he should have loved all his children equally, not one above all the others, even if that one was Thea.",
      "He watched her shape as she moved further into the garden, drifting a grey river behind her, and felt he was beginning to understand why - in her photos - she was always alone."

    "text": "The TARDIS completed a relatively smooth landing. As the box came to a stop, the Doctor finished pulling the last of the levers and turned to Martha. \"And where- or when?- are we this time?\" she asked him. \"We should be on Earth, America to be exact. I'm hoping for 21st century, about your time, Ms. Jones. Supposed to be the last time to see the great San Franciscan mountains. Should be beautiful!\" the Doctor pulled the doors to the TARDIS and promptly fell backwards as the ground began to tremble. \"Doctor? What's going on?\" Martha asked, grabbing onto the center console as the police box shook. The Doctor grabbed his sonic screwdriver and scanned the ground outside as everything stopped shaking. \"That's weird,\" he ran inside and starting hitting buttons on the computer, while hitting the button on his sonic. \"Doctor, what is it?\" Martha wondered. The Doctor hmm-ed and ran back outside, scanning the ground with his screwdriver and sticking his finger up, testing the air, before he looked back to Martha. \"There shouldn't have been an earthquake here,\" he began, \"it was a 4.5, there isn't due to be one of this magnitude here for another five years, something's not right, the mountains, something to do with the mountains,\" the Doctor trailed off, ending his rambling. \"So it wasn't natural,\" Martha concluded. \"Exactamundo! No, nevermind, I told myself I'd never say that again, doesn't taste right. Anyway! Right, the earthquake, it wasn't natural, it came from the mountains.\" \"So we're gonna go check it our, right?\" Martha asked, excited to go and explore once more. \"Allons-y!\" the Time Lord exclaimed, running back to the center of the TARDIS, setting it to land in the mountains a few miles away from where they were. *** Artemis was running through the forest, about to knock an arrow when she heard a strange noise. It was unlike any sound she had ever heard before, a strange mechanical vwrop-ing, extra loud in the quiet of the forest. The animals startled, ruining her chance to shoot her prey. She walked towards the source of the sound, watching a strange blue box appear as the sound stopped. She moved closer to the box, reading the sign on top, proclaiming it to be a police box. She slowly inched towards it as the doors swung inwards and a man walked out in a brown trench coat and very stand-upish hair. \"We have to trace it back to the source, come on, Martha!\" the man was saying, calling behind him to a woman, who followed him out of the very strange, materializing box, that was somehow big enough to fit to adults inside. \"Oi!\" the man called out, having spotted the goddess standing by the trees, staring at him. While she may be the goddess of the hunt, and therefore be very stealthy, she was too stunned to properly hide, as this was a scene that she had never before seen. \"Who are you?\" he asked, eyebrows raised. After a quick internal debate over whether or not to tell this man who she really is, she decided to be truthful with this strange man. \"My name is Artemis and this is my forest. I should be asking who you are!\" \"I'm the Doctor and this is Martha. But you're the more interesting one here. Artemis, young woman, bow and arrow, 'your' forest. There's only one creature I can think of like that, so I must ask, why are you impersonating a Greek goddess?\" he said, so fast she almost couldn't keep up. \"I'm not sure I follow you,\" she began, confused, \"impersonating myself?\" \"Of course!\" he exclaimed, as if it were obvious, \"only you're not actually Artemis. You're an alien. But I want to know why you chose a goddess. Of all the things... a goddess... so obviously false. What an awful disguise!\" he sounded disgusted at the thought of it. \"Now, just to think. Humanoid, huntress, young, earthquake? Was that you?\" \"I don't understand, you believe in aliens but you don't believe in the gods and goddesses. And no!\" she yelled, offended that he could think such things of her, \"How dare you accuse me of causing that earthquake, it scarred away all the animals in MY forest, and they were just starting to come out when YOU showed up with your stupid box and its stupid noises!\" she stormed towards him and jabbed him in the chest with her finger. \"Oi! My box is not stupid, and neither are her sounds!\" the Doctor exclaimed in outrage. \"And aliens do not exist!\" Artemis finished, as if the Doctor had never spoken. \"Well, no, you're wrong. Aliens do exist, you see, I am one. Look, two hearts!\" he grinned goofily, using both hands to gesture to his chest, and his supposed two hearts. Artemis put her hand against the left side of the Doctor's chest, feeling his heartbeat, and then moved her hand to the right, letting out a surprised noise when she felt another heart. \"I don't understand, of all the beasts I've encountered, none of them have ever had two hearts. What are you?\" she asked, bewildered. \"I told you, I'm an alien!\" he replied, a dopey grin on his face about having proved her wrong. \"A Time Lord, the last of my time,\" he told her, the smile fading off his face towards the end. \"But now, what I don't understand is you. Unless you're an amazing actress, you clearly didn't believe in aliens, and there's something distinctly not human about you.\" \"Doctor,\" the girl, Martha, spoke for the first time, \"maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe there are actually gods and goddesses. I didn't believe it either, but something about her makes me think she's telling the truth,\" Martha tried to tell the Doctor. Finally, someone believed her. \"Thank you for believing me, I am Artemis, daughter of Zeus, goddess of the hunt,\" she told them. Suddenly, there was a loud scream, coming from some place in the mountains, not too far off. \"What was that?\" Martha asked, and they looked at each other and started running towards the sound. \"There aren't normally people in here, this isn't a normal forest, it was weird enough when you two showed up, and now there's a screaming human? Something isn't right here,\" Artemis told them as they ran through the forest. \"I could've told you that!\" the Doctor yelled. \"Come on, we need to find whoever screamed, it's probably linked to the earthquake!\" *** The Doctor, Martha, and Artemis stopped in front of a large clearing in the forest at the base of a mountain, blocked by a large gate that appeared to be made of stone. Artemis gasped and exclaimed, \"It's Mt. Othrys! This is Atlas, this is his home.\" \"Atlas? Like, sentenced to hold up the sky for eternity?\" Martha asked. \"Yeah, that's him. He must be up to something. But how do we get past this door? I can try to get it open, but I'm not sure how to,\" Artemis told them. \"Let me try,\" the Doctor said, stepping forward. He pointed his sonic screwdriver at the gate and soniced it. The gate shimmered and disappeared, showing a meadow at the base of the Mt. Othrys, and a mob of mortals where Atlas should be. \"Um, Doctor? What's happening?\" Martha asked. \"It looks like he's trying to get them to hold the sky for him. He's tried it before. It'll be difficult to get it back to him, though, if he gets them to hold it up first. Because then we'll need to trick him into taking it back, and only Hercules has done that,\" Artemis explained to them. \"We need a plan,\" the Doctor said, surprising Martha since he normally never has a plan beforehand. \"You want to come up with a proper plan?\" Martha asked, raising an eyebrow at him. \"Well, we're working with a goddess now! We need plans, Martha!\" the Doctor exclaimed, clapping his hands together and leading them back into the sheltered area of the forest. \"Okay, so we should find a way to get someone to go in and tell the people the plan,\" the Doctor explained. \"You mean the plan that we have?\" Martha asked, smirking. \"Well, we will have a plan,\" he said. \"Whoever goes in should get everyone to drop the sky. Since it's Atlas's punishment, he'll be forced to take it back, as long as everyone is about to. As soon as he touches it they need to let go,\" Artemis outlined the beginning of the plan. \"Then we need someone else to lead everyone out and far away from here, and out of the forest. I'll distract Atlas while we get ready,\" she continued. Just then the ground rumbled, shaking the three of them. \"The sky must have changed holders, that's what's been causing the earthquakes. We can still do this, it'll just be a little more difficult. Same plan though, I'll get Atlas in place,\" Artemis finished explaining. \"Okay, I'll go in, Doctor, you lead everyone out,\" Martha said to the Doctor. \"Alright, now how do we get you in?\" the Doctor questioned. \"I have an idea,\" Artemis said, her face breaking into a grin. *** Martha walked into the meadow, thankful for the distraction Artemis was about to provide, and went straight towards the people who were holding the sky. As Martha approached them, she looked towards Atlas, who was facing the other direction. As she looked up, she saw an arrow race through the air towards the titan. Atlas let out a yell and whipped around to find the source of the arrow. \"You,\" he sneered when he spotted Artemis. \"I'm not about to let some little goddess ruin my freedom for me, I'll kill you before you're arrows can get me.\" Martha used the distraction Artemis had created and snuck into the mix of people, turning to them and saying, \"We're going to get you out, you just need to follow our plan, alright?\" The people were wary of her at first, but then she convinced them that they really did want to help, and that they had a plan that would set them free. Martha explained about the Doctor, who was hiding by the gates, getting ready to bring the people away. She told them about Artemis, and about how they would all have to be ready to run from the sky, and slowly let go, one by one, and then when Atlas touched it, that they would need to drop it. In Artemis's battle with Atlas, she was slowly backing him towards the sky, getting him in position. Artemis and Martha locked eyes, and then Artemis moved in on Atlas, drawing her silver knives. She pushed him further back, and as he realized what she was doing Martha yelled \"NOW!\" and the mortals all dropped their arms and ran in the direction Martha had told them to, as Atlas was left once more to hold the sky. Martha and Artemis didn't follow the others, but stayed behind, waiting for the Doctor to return from leading everyone to freedom. When he arrived, he was holding a long chain in his hand. \"To make sure you don't escape again, if some unlucky traveler happens to pass by you,\" he told Atlas, chaining him to the mountain, despite Atlas's thrashing and attempts to break the chains. \"That won't work, they're special chains, I even soniced them. They won't break,\" he explained to the distressed titan. Martha cast one last look at Atlas before turning and leaving with Artemis and the Doctor. *** \"That was quite the adventure! Gods, goddesses, titans and the works! Real! Who would've thought?\" the Doctor said as they approached the TARDIS. \"Learn something new every day, especially when you're traveling with this one,\" Martha said, gesturing towards the Doctor. \"Well, I didn't think aliens exist. So tell me Doctor, what exactly does this machine of yours do?\" Artemis asked him. \"It's a TARDIS, Time and Relative Dimensions in Space. I stole her, she stole me, she takes me anywhere or anywhen I want to go. Well, not really, she gets it wrong often, but she always takes me where I'm needed,\" he explained. \"It's bigger on the inside,\" Martha told Artemis, \"it's fascinating, really. You could spend ages just trying to work your way through all the rooms.\" \"Would you like to see it?\" the Doctor offered. \"That's kind Doctor, but I should be getting back to my duties now. Perhaps I'll see the two of you again. Until then,\" she said, and then ran off into the woods. \"Bye!\" called the Doctor and Martha together. \"Alright, where to next?\" he asked, walking into the TARDIS. \"I don't know, let's go to a different planet this time,\" Martha smiled, following him inside.",

      "Unless you're an amazing actress, you clearly didn't believe in aliens, and there's something distinctly not human about you.\"",
      "\"Doctor,\" the girl, Martha, spoke for the first time, \"maybe she's telling the truth.",
      "Maybe there are actually gods and goddesses.",
      "I didn't believe it either, but something about her makes me think she's telling the truth,\" Martha tried to tell the Doctor.",
      "Finally, someone believed her.",
      "\"Thank you for believing me, I am Artemis, daughter of Zeus, goddess of the hunt,\" she told them.",
      "Suddenly, there was a loud scream, coming from some place in the mountains, not too far off.",
      "\"What was that?\" Martha asked, and they looked at each other and started running towards the sound.",
      "\"There aren't normally people in here, this isn't a normal forest, it was weird enough when you two showed up, and now there's a screaming human?",
      "Something isn't right here,\" Artemis told them as they ran through the forest.",
      "\"I could've told you that!\"",
      "the Doctor yelled.",
      "\"Come on, we need to find whoever screamed, it's probably linked to the earthquake!\"",
      "*** The Doctor, Martha, and Artemis stopped in front of a large clearing in the forest at the base of a mountain, blocked by a large gate that appeared to be made of stone.",
      "Artemis gasped and exclaimed, \"It's Mt. Othrys!",
      "This is Atlas, this is his home.\"",
      "\"Atlas?",
      "Like, sentenced to hold up the sky for eternity?\" Martha asked.",
      "\"Yeah, that's him.",
      "He must be up to something.",
      "But how do we get past this door?",
      "I can try to get it open, but I'm not sure how to,\" Artemis told them.",
      "\"Let me try,\" the Doctor said, stepping forward.",
      "He pointed his sonic screwdriver at the gate and soniced it.",
      "The gate shimmered and disappeared, showing a meadow at the base of the Mt. Othrys, and a mob of mortals where Atlas should be.",
      "\"Um, Doctor?",
      "What's happening?\" Martha asked.",
      "\"It looks like he's trying to get them to hold the sky for him.",
      "He's tried it before.",
      "It'll be difficult to get it back to him, though, if he gets them to hold it up first.",
      "Because then we'll need to trick him into taking it back, and only Hercules has done that,\" Artemis explained to them.",
      "\"We need a plan,\" the Doctor said, surprising Martha since he normally never has a plan beforehand.",
      "\"You want to come up with a proper plan?\" Martha asked, raising an eyebrow at him.",
      "\"Well, we're working with a goddess now!",
      "We need plans, Martha!\"",
      "the Doctor exclaimed, clapping his hands together and leading them back into the sheltered area of the forest.",
      "\"Okay, so we should find a way to get someone to go in and tell the people the plan,\" the Doctor explained.",
      "\"You mean the plan that we have?\" Martha asked, smirking.",
      "\"Well, we will have a plan,\" he said.",
      "\"Whoever goes in should get everyone to drop the sky.",
      "Since it's Atlas's punishment, he'll be forced to take it back, as long as everyone is about to.",
      "As soon as he touches it they need to let go,\" Artemis outlined the beginning of the plan.",
      "\"Then we need someone else to lead everyone out and far away from here, and out of the forest.",
      "I'll distract Atlas while we get ready,\" she continued.",
      "Just then the ground rumbled, shaking the three of them.",
      "\"The sky must have changed holders, that's what's been causing the earthquakes.",
      "We can still do this, it'll just be a little more difficult.",
      "Same plan though, I'll get Atlas in place,\" Artemis finished explaining.",
      "\"Okay, I'll go in, Doctor, you lead everyone out,\" Martha said to the Doctor.",
      "\"Alright, now how do we get you in?\" the Doctor questioned.",
      "\"I have an idea,\" Artemis said, her face breaking into a grin.",
      "*",
      "** Martha walked into the meadow, thankful for the distraction Artemis was about to provide, and went straight towards the people who were holding the sky.",
      "As Martha approached them, she looked towards Atlas, who was facing the other direction.",
      "As she looked up, she saw an arrow race through the air towards the titan.",
      "Atlas let out a yell and whipped around to find the source of the arrow.",
      "\"You,\" he sneered when he spotted Artemis.",
      "\"I'm not about to let some little goddess ruin my freedom for me, I'll kill you before you're arrows can get me.\"",
      "Martha used the distraction Artemis had created and snuck into the mix of people, turning to them and saying, \"We're going to get you out, you just need to follow our plan, alright?\"",
      "The people were wary of her at first, but then she convinced them that they really did want to help, and that they had a plan that would set them free.",
      "Martha explained about the Doctor, who was hiding by the gates, getting ready to bring the people away.",
      "She told them about Artemis, and about how they would all have to be ready to run from the sky, and slowly let go, one by one, and then when Atlas touched it, that they would need to drop it.",
      "In Artemis's battle with Atlas, she was slowly backing him towards the sky, getting him in position.",
      "Artemis and Martha locked eyes, and then Artemis moved in on Atlas, drawing her silver knives.",
      "She pushed him further back, and as he realized what she was doing Martha yelled \"NOW!\"",
      "and the mortals all dropped their arms and ran in the direction Martha had told them to, as Atlas was left once more to hold the sky.",
      "Martha and Artemis didn't follow the others, but stayed behind, waiting for the Doctor to return from leading everyone to freedom.",
      "When he arrived, he was holding a long chain in his hand.",
      "\"To make sure you don't escape again, if some unlucky traveler happens to pass by you,\" he told Atlas, chaining him to the mountain, despite Atlas's thrashing and attempts to break the chains.",
      "\"That won't work, they're special chains, I even soniced them.",
      "They won't break,\" he explained to the distressed titan.",
      "Martha cast one last look at Atlas before turning and leaving with Artemis and the Doctor.",
      "*",
      "** \"That was quite the adventure!",
      "Gods, goddesses, titans and the works!",
      "Real!",
      "Who would've thought?\" the Doctor said as they approached the TARDIS.",
      "\"Learn something new every day, especially when you're traveling with this one,\" Martha said, gesturing towards the Doctor.",
      "\"Well, I didn't think aliens exist.",
      "So tell me Doctor, what exactly does this machine of yours do?\"",
      "Artemis asked him.",
      "\"It's a TARDIS, Time and Relative Dimensions in Space.",
      "I stole her, she stole me, she takes me anywhere or anywhen I want to go.",
      "Well, not really, she gets it wrong often, but she always takes me where I'm needed,\" he explained.",
      "\"It's bigger on the inside,\" Martha told Artemis, \"it's fascinating, really.",
      "You could spend ages just trying to work your way through all the rooms.\"",
      "\"Would you like to see it?\" the Doctor offered.",
      "\"That's kind Doctor, but I should be getting back to my duties now.",
      "Perhaps I'll see the two of you again.",
      "Until then,\" she said, and then ran off into the woods.",
      "\"Bye!\"",
      "called the Doctor and Martha together.",
      "\"Alright, where to next?\" he asked, walking into the TARDIS.",
      "\"I don't know, let's go to a different planet this time,\" Martha smiled, following him inside."

    "text": "Once, long ago, there was a boy named Daniel. He was the son of Madeline, the greatest ghosthunter in the land. This boy had an older sister Jasmine who looked after him. The pair of them were inseparable. Daniel was a flighty boy, always getting into trouble. Jasmine was his teacher as well as his sister, so blessed with wisdom and knowledge was she. She watched over her brother while their mother did her work, protecting the people in the world of the living from the evil unquiet dead. While Madeline guarded the farmers and the shepherds her children played in the fields, safe in the knowledge that their mother and father would not let anything happen to them. For their father was none other than Jack, the magistrate of the land. His laws decided the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead. It was in his lab that the sole permanent portal between the realms stood. And it was in that lab where Plasmius, lord of the underworld, came to pay him a visit. \"Vladimir my friend!\" cried Jack. \"It has been many long years since we have met like this. Twenty I believe. How are you, my friend?\" Plasmius bristled. \"Those twenty years of which you speak I have spent in exile from the world of the living,\" he said. His voice was cold and hard as were all the voices of the dead. \"But, dear friend...\" \"Anything for you,\" Jack promised. Plasmius waved his hand in front of a mirror. That mirror changed, glowing with magic to show a scene of two youths in a field. One, a girl, scolded the antics of the other, a boy, yet did nothing to stop him as she ran after him and joined in his innocent revelry. \"Your children are grown by now, are they not?\" Plasmius asked. \"And yet their mother has turned down all suitors who might come to claim them into marriage.\" \"Yes, it seems sometimes that she plans to keep them as her children forever,\" Jack mused. \"I hear she will choose one to take up her own mantle.\" \"I know that all who approach her are turned away and bound into agreement not to press the matter. So, Jack, my friend, I come to you. I wish to take a bride.\" \"I can think of no better to have the hand of my daughter than you, Lord Plasmius.\" \"Not your daughter, Jack. Your son.\" And so, with Jack's permission Plasmius made his plans. The two siblings did not often part from one another and so it was difficult to capture the one he desired. Still, Plasmius was a patient man. One day his patience paid off when Jasmine fell asleep under a shade tree one pleasant day. Daniel, as he was not tired, wandered off into the fields looking for some trick to play on his sister. From below Plasmius rent the field asunder. Daniel stood frightened in front of the great blue-skinned monster before him. And then it came for him. Daniel screamed and attempted to flee. Plasmius gave chase and easily caught the boy, hoisting him in the air like a maiden. With his prize in hand Plasmius descended back to the underworld, to the land of the dead. When Jasmine awoke she could not find her brother. There was no sign of him in the field for the ground had been made anew. She searched for him, calling his name. \"Brother, Daniel my little brother, where are you?\" she cried. She searched long into the night, long after their mother demanded they come home yet still she could not find him. Finally she went home to her mother. \"Why are you home late?\" Madeline asked. \"And where is your brother?\" \"Oh Mother, I'm so sorry,\" Jasmine cried. \"I could not find him! I fell asleep under a tree and when I awoke he was gone! I looked all over for him, Mother, honest!\" \"Oh by the Observants!\" Madeline cried. \"We must find him!\" Meanwhile, in the underworld Plasmius had his bride, his Daniel. \"I have taken you to make you my bride, my dear Daniel,\" Plasmius explained. \"Your father has allowed this for he and I have known each other for many, many years. He feels I will make you a good husband and so graciously offered me your hand in marriage.\" \"But... my hand was not his to give!\" Daniel cried. \"Nor was it your own,\" Plasmius said. \"You remember your friends Samantha and Tucker, do you not?\" \"Of course! I miss them. They have not been to see me in many months and I do not know why.\" \"I know why, Daniel. Each of them asked for your hand and your mother rejected them without consulting you. She did not consider your hand to be yours to give. She would have kept you for herself as she keeps your sister. Your father does not wish that for you and so I agreed to make you my queen.\" Daniel had never thought of ruling as a queen before. The idea intrigued him. Yet he was not swayed. He missed the life he had in the world of the living with his sister and his mother. He missed the feel of sunlight and the sound of grass waving in the wind. He missed the trees and the sky. Over the months Plasmuis showed him many wonders. Caves of the underworld populated by great flying monsters and adorned with crystals that shone like the stars. Vast pools of dark water where within lurked the sleeping souls of sailors. Daniel was given a bed made of the softest goose down and a sky of swirling black and green. He was tempted with the finest foods the underworld had to offer: cakes and pies, roast beast and pheasant, bread and ale. Yet Daniel remembered one truth spoken to him long ago by his father. 'All those who eat the food in the world of the dead are doomed to dwell there for all time.' And thus Daniel was not tempted. Plasmius was worried for his young bride. He showed the boy the wonders of the underworld, reveled in Daniel's wonder and contentment. Yet still the boy would not eat. He was growing thin and pale, much like the shades of the unquiet dead. And so Plasmius begged the boy. \"Why do you not eat anything, my dear?\" \"Because I know that if I do I will be doomed to stay here forever,\" Daniel answered. \"I miss my mother and sister so.\" Plasmius tried again, tempting the boy with cookies and cream, roast chicken and duck, cheese and wine. Still Daniel would not be tempted. \"You are fading into a shade, my dear,\" Plasmius lamented. \"You will stay here regardless if you do not eat something for you will be dead.\" Daniel held his empty stomach. He was so hungry and yet he would not touch the foods offered to him. \"I will only eat food grown under the sun, in the wind and rain,\" he finally agreed. \"I will only eat the food of the living.\" And so Plasmius sent his three best messengers to fly across the world of the living, to search for food for their queen. After days of searching they returned with their find. A single pomegranate with six withered seeds. Plasmuis demanded news from his messengers, demanded to know why this was all they could find. \"But Boss,\" said the first vulture. \"There's no food growin' up there.\" \"And the shades, they're runnin' free,\" said the second vulture. \"The hunter Madeline, she's given up her post while she's been lookin' for her son,\" said the third vulture. \"The shades, they're runnin' all around, scarin' the people into not plantin' no food and harvestin' no crops,\" the three said in unison. \"The unquiet dead are takin' over the world of the livin'.\" \"I have no control over the unquiet dead,\" Plasmius said. \"Madeline should be protecting the world of the living from them. If she will not then the Observants will enforce their will upon her. Very well, my messengers.\" With that he dismissed them and took their find to his bride. He offered Daniel the pomegranate with its withered seeds. \"You did this for me?\" Daniel asked. \"I sent my best messengers to the world of the living, my dear,\" Plasmius said. \"They searched far and wide and yet this is all they could bring me.\" Daniel held the pomegranate with its withered seeds. One by one he ate them. Though dry and withered he felt them nourish him. His eyes glowed with life and he smiled at his husband Plasmius. For while he missed his life with his mother and sister he had grown fond of his life here with his husband. Six months had passed and Daniel accepted his life as queen of the underworld. However Madeline and Jasmine had never stopped searching. Finally, the great god of time Clockwork came down from the heavens. He heard the cries of the people chased by ghosts and could not bear to watch the world fall into darkness. He sought out the great ghost hunter Madeline, finding her and her daughter as they searched the world of the living for her lost son. \"You will not find him here,\" Clockwork said. Madeline drew her weapon and aimed it at the spirit before her. \"And what would you know of my son, missing these past six months?\" she demanded. \"Madam, I am Clockwork and I know all that was, is, and will be. I am the master of time. Your son was taken by the lord of the underworld, Plasmius.\" \"And what does Plasmius want with my boy?\" \"Why, to be his living bride,\" Clockwork said. \"Young Daniel's hand was granted to Plasmius by Jack, his father. He did not tell you because you had already rejected other suitors seeking his hand, the youth Tucker and the maiden Samantha. You must go down to the world of the dead to find your son.\" Madeline nodded. \"Thank you, Clockwork, oh God of Time. Thank you with all of my heart.\" She grabbed her daughter's arm and the pair of them ran to the portal. Within the lands of the dead mother and daughter faced many trials and much darkness, some of which are stories of their own. But after many days of travel the pair of them at last came upon the great castle of the lord of the underworld. They were welcomed to the castle with opened arms by the three vultures and led to the throne room where Plasmius and Daniel sat upon thrones made of bone and gems. \"Mother!\" Daniel cried. He leapt up from his throne and ran to her, throwing himself into her arms. \"I've missed you so much!\" Madeline held her son close and wept into his neck. \"I've missed you to, my beloved son.\" \"And Jasmine, my sister! The months have been long without your counsel.\" \"And mine without your antics, dear brother,\" Jasmine said. A feeling of dread came across the great hunter Madeline as she held her son. She pulled out of his embrace to look at him at arm's length. \"Daniel, my son, my precious boy,\" she said. \"Did you eat anything here in the world of the dead?\" \"I did, Mother,\" he confessed. \"I was so hungry. But I knew if I ate anything that came from this land I would be bound to it forever. I had Plasmius send messengers to search the world of the living for something I could eat. They brought me a single pomegranate with six seeds inside it.\" Madeline glared at Plasmius upon his throne. He smiled in return with his blood red eyes shining. \"My dear Madeline,\" he said. \"I did not wish to steal your son from you. But he had refused food and drink for so long he had become as a shade, pale and lifeless. I would have done anything to see him avoid that fate. My vultures scoured the world of the living but found it barren. Ghosts ravaged the lands and people neglected to plant their crops because you abandoned your oath to protect the worlds from those I cannot control. I would have given anything, even my own throne, to avoid losing him to shadow and dust.\" Plasmius rose from his throne and drifted down to his bride. He draped his swan-white cape over Daniel and held the boy close. \"He has eaten here in the world of the dead and here he will stay.\" Madeline grabbed her son's hand and made to drag him away with it. \"No, Lord Plasmius,\" she said. \"He has only eaten food from the world of the living. He's not bound by the laws of the underworld. He will return with us.\" Both parties saw that they would not yield. It seemed that war between the living and the dead would be declared until... \"Stop!\" cried Jasmine. \"Mother, Daniel has eaten here in the underworld. Therefore he is not living and cannot stay with us. Lord Plasmius, Daniel has only eaten food from the world of the living. Therefore he is not dead and cannot stay here.\" \"What's your point?\" Plasmius asked. \"He is not living and he is not dead,\" Jasmine said. \"He is both and neither. No one of us has claim over him. Not you, Mother, and not you, Lord Plasmius. He is half ghost.\" And so an agreement was made. Madeline would go back to protecting the world of the living from the unquiet dead. As Daniel was half ghost he would return with his mother and sister to the world of the living. There he would stay for six months before returning to the world of the dead and spending six months with his husband. Plasmius could not deny his bride anything. And so he kissed Daniel goodbye, knowing he would return. Lord Plasmius was a patient creature. And in six months that patience was rewarded when his Daniel returned to him.",

      "\"I miss my mother and sister so.\"",
      "Plasmius tried again, tempting the boy with cookies and cream, roast chicken and duck, cheese and wine.",
      "Still Daniel would not be tempted.",
      "\"You are fading into a shade, my dear,\" Plasmius lamented.",
      "\"You will stay here regardless if you do not eat something for you will be dead.\"",
      "Daniel held his empty stomach.",
      "He was so hungry and yet he would not touch the foods offered to him.",
      "\"I will only eat food grown under the sun, in the wind and rain,\" he finally agreed.",
      "\"I will only eat the food of the living.\"",
      "And so Plasmius sent his three best messengers to fly across the world of the living, to search for food for their queen.",
      "After days of searching they returned with their find.",
      "A single pomegranate with six withered seeds.",
      "Plasmuis demanded news from his messengers, demanded to know why this was all they could find.",
      "\"But Boss,\" said the first vulture.",
      "\"There's no food growin' up there.\"",
      "\"And the shades, they're runnin' free,\" said the second vulture.",
      "\"The hunter Madeline, she's given up her post while she's been lookin' for her son,\" said the third vulture.",
      "\"The shades, they're runnin' all around, scarin' the people into not plantin' no food and harvestin' no crops,\" the three said in unison.",
      "\"The unquiet dead are takin' over the world of the livin'.\"",
      "\"I have no control over the unquiet dead,\" Plasmius said.",
      "\"Madeline should be protecting the world of the living from them.",
      "If she will not then the Observants will enforce their will upon her.",
      "Very well, my messengers.\"",
      "With that he dismissed them and took their find to his bride.",
      "He offered Daniel the pomegranate with its withered seeds.",
      "\"You did this for me?\" Daniel asked.",
      "\"I sent my best messengers to the world of the living, my dear,\" Plasmius said.",
      "\"They searched far and wide and yet this is all they could bring me.\"",
      "Daniel held the pomegranate with its withered seeds.",
      "One by one he ate them.",
      "Though dry and withered he felt them nourish him.",
      "His eyes glowed with life and he smiled at his husband Plasmius.",
      "For while he missed his life with his mother and sister he had grown fond of his life here with his husband.",
      "Six months had passed and Daniel accepted his life as queen of the underworld.",
      "However Madeline and Jasmine had never stopped searching.",
      "Finally, the great god of time Clockwork came down from the heavens.",
      "He heard the cries of the people chased by ghosts and could not bear to watch the world fall into darkness.",
      "He sought out the great ghost hunter Madeline, finding her and her daughter as they searched the world of the living for her lost son.",
      "\"You will not find him here,\" Clockwork said.",
      "Madeline drew her weapon and aimed it at the spirit before her.",
      "\"And what would you know of my son, missing these past six months?\" she demanded.",
      "\"Madam, I am Clockwork and I know all that was, is, and will be.",
      "I am the master of time.",
      "Your son was taken by the lord of the underworld, Plasmius.\"",
      "\"And what does Plasmius want with my boy?\" \"Why, to be his living bride,\" Clockwork said.",
      "\"Young Daniel's hand was granted to Plasmius by Jack, his father.",
      "He did not tell you because you had already rejected other suitors seeking his hand, the youth Tucker and the maiden Samantha.",
      "You must go down to the world of the dead to find your son.\"",
      "Madeline nodded.",
      "\"Thank you, Clockwork, oh God of Time.",
      "Thank you with all of my heart.\"",
      "She grabbed her daughter's arm and the pair of them ran to the portal.",
      "Within the lands of the dead mother and daughter faced many trials and much darkness, some of which are stories of their own.",
      "But after many days of travel the pair of them at last came upon the great castle of the lord of the underworld.",
      "They were welcomed to the castle with opened arms by the three vultures and led to the throne room where Plasmius and Daniel sat upon thrones made of bone and gems.",
      "\"Mother!\"",
      "Daniel cried.",
      "He leapt up from his throne and ran to her, throwing himself into her arms.",
      "\"I've missed you so much!\"",
      "Madeline held her son close and wept into his neck.",
      "\"I've missed you to, my beloved son.\"",
      "\"And Jasmine, my sister!",
      "The months have been long without your counsel.\"",
      "\"And mine without your antics, dear brother,\" Jasmine said.",
      "A feeling of dread came across the great hunter Madeline as she held her son.",
      "She pulled out of his embrace to look at him at arm's length.",
      "\"Daniel, my son, my precious boy,\" she said.",
      "\"Did you eat anything here in the world of the dead?\"",
      "\"I did, Mother,\" he confessed.",
      "\"I was so hungry.",
      "But I knew if I ate anything that came from this land I would be bound to it forever.",
      "I had Plasmius send messengers to search the world of the living for something I could eat.",
      "They brought me a single pomegranate with six seeds inside it.\"",
      "Madeline glared at Plasmius upon his throne.",
      "He smiled in return with his blood red eyes shining.",
      "\"My dear Madeline,\" he said.",
      "\"I did not wish to steal your son from you.",
      "But he had refused food and drink for so long he had become as a shade, pale and lifeless.",
      "I would have done anything to see him avoid that fate.",
      "My vultures scoured the world of the living but found it barren.",
      "Ghosts ravaged the lands and people neglected to plant their crops because you abandoned your oath to protect the worlds from those I cannot control.",
      "I would have given anything, even my own throne, to avoid losing him to shadow and dust.\"",
      "Plasmius rose from his throne and drifted down to his bride.",
      "He draped his swan-white cape over Daniel and held the boy close.",
      "\"He has eaten here in the world of the dead and here he will stay.\"",
      "Madeline grabbed her son's hand and made to drag him away with it.",
      "\"No, Lord Plasmius,\" she said.",
      "\"He has only eaten food from the world of the living.",
      "He's not bound by the laws of the underworld.",
      "He will return with us.\"",
      "Both parties saw that they would not yield.",
      "It seemed that war between the living and the dead would be declared until...",
      "\"Stop!\"",
      "cried Jasmine.",
      "\"Mother, Daniel has eaten here in the underworld.",
      "Therefore he is not living and cannot stay with us.",
      "Lord Plasmius, Daniel has only eaten food from the world of the living.",
      "Therefore he is not dead and cannot stay here.\"",
      "\"What's your point?\" Plasmius asked.",
      "\"He is not living and he is not dead,\" Jasmine said.",
      "\"He is both and neither.",
      "No one of us has claim over him.",
      "Not you, Mother, and not you, Lord Plasmius.",
      "He is half ghost.\"",
      "And so an agreement was made.",
      "Madeline would go back to protecting the world of the living from the unquiet dead.",
      "As Daniel was half ghost he would return with his mother and sister to the world of the living.",
      "There he would stay for six months before returning to the world of the dead and spending six months with his husband.",
      "Plasmius could not deny his bride anything.",
      "And so he kissed Daniel goodbye, knowing he would return.",
      "Lord Plasmius was a patient creature.",
      "And in six months that patience was rewarded when his Daniel returned to him."

    "text": "Say what you like about gods roaming the land disguised as various things, just looking for an attractive hole in which to force a penis of truly epic proportions. But you can't deny that rape is just as much a human pastime as a divine one. Well, it's true! When you capture an enemy's women and young boys, you divide them up as spoils and then you rape them. If you stay in a house and like the look of the pretty wiggly serving girls or tender young slave boys, you rape them. If you defeat a king and carry off his queen, you rape her. The shepherds of your flocks, when there's no one else around to do, may seize a ewe's back legs, thrust them into his boots and his organ into her hole, while the beast no doubts bleats and bleeds something awful. In fact even the most elaborate ceremonies based around your matings are play rapes half the time these days, the girl carried off by the groom and guards set outside the door to make sure she doesn't escape. Even when it's all arranged beforehand and the one underneath is willing, to a degree, then it's rape. Which brings me to my ever so famous rape. Which was not a rape because there was no disguise, capture or force but only a true mating, a mating truer and deeper and more splendid than any royal marriage with the exchange of riches and the fancy robes peeled off, a marriage of earth and life and death. There was a chase, though, and quite a lot of sex and screaming, but all of it was very enjoyable. Oh, I'm not surprised you haven't heard of that version, my dear, it's not the sort of thing the priests of my mate like to bandy about. After all, he's one of the few in the family that's managed to keep his dignity intact; they're not about to go and ruin all that by blabbing about how the first time he met his queen, we rutted for days on end and slept curled about each other so tight we might have melted together and never been separated. Like that lad of Hermes and Aphrodite, only with perfect willingness. The sex was that good. Your tongue doesn't have a word for the shape I wore back then. I don't mean an estimation of how my beauty and power could be measured, I mean my actual shape. Let's say that it was a mix between a deer and a lion, the legs that bound, the claws that rip, hair like milk stirred through honey. One thing your stories get right, I was preoccupied with flowers when he first saw me. I was eating them. Delicious. And he; big strong male, muscles rippling under darkest wood brown fur, powerful back legs, good for running and pouncing. And such a smell of earth and richness! He caught my scent first and when I looked up there he was, with nostrils flared and breast heaving with lust. And yes, I ran, but ran to see if he could catch me. And when at last I slowed enough that he could, oh, you think your kind were the first to know pleasure in the act? Or mate looking into each others eyes? (Being able to transform your body at a whim to suit you does help.) Rape is such a human word. You say I was raped; how can the earth rape the spring, how can the land rape life and death? But the two can mate and become one. That we can and still do. And where oh where, you might ask, was poor distraught Demeter during those days and nights that we mated and roared and shrieked? Searching distracted for her daughter? To put it simply, she wasn't there at all. You've been sitting and listening with great patience and without interrupting, most polite and wise, but surely you've wondered why I was eating the flowers instead of picking them, and where all my nymph attendants were while he chased me, and what happened to his chariot and his helm. And what happened to us? Fur and claws and shapes of animals, are these your gods? That was what we were before your worship, beautiful and personifying the world around us, Zeus as the eagle soaring in his domain, Poseidon as a fish in the deepest seas, my mate as a wolf or a lion in the mountains. And me, I liked being a snake that sheds its skin and forever renews its life, but I preferred my lion-deer form after I met my mate. Mammals have the best sex. It takes a lot to kill a god, we're a tough breed. But it doesn't take a lot to make one, or to infect one. You humans, you're the god's disease. You get under our skin and into our veins, you push on organs and bones and retract fur and teeth, you make us into your image. You force us to change. You rape progress into us. The family became what they are because of you. Look at us: once an earth being and life and death personified, now the Lord of the Dead and his spring goddess wife. Swaying under the weight of our crowns and swamped in our new robes, crouched uncomfortably on our thrones as the first souls come pouring down in expectancy of something, as we wonder what the hell just happened. I apologise, that was unfair. I think that our change at least was fairly easy, since we're perfectly happy to stay under the earth and let you get on with the business of your lives, and you're perfectly happy to avoid mentioning us for the most part. It's the gods upstairs who really suffer. Which brings us back to Demeter. Who wasn't there to look for me because she hadn't been born yet. And yes, I know the legends. The big six, with Zeus the golden boy as the youngest and variations on who was the eldest, depending on whether you're using the order of birth or the order of disgorging. I was there, you weren't, and I can tell you Hera, Hestia and Demeter didn't appear on the scene until after your lot showed up. I mean, why should they be? There have always been earth, sea and sky (and life and death), but there wasn't marriage or the holy hearth or agriculture or anything like that until you started to have need of them. And then, there were your goddesses, reshaped from some poor unfortunate divines who were chopped up and stuck back together to suit your whims. Perhaps that's why they all look so peaky, poor girls. Or maybe I dis-remember and they really were there from the start and just called themselves different names at first. I'll admit I wasn't paying much attention back then. I must sound like a dreadful slut to you, but what I was mostly concerned with was eating, sleeping and fucking, which is what life was for the most part, and I was life as well as death. Then you and your goddesses came along and changed all that. And more gods of your mind followed, and more! Even the almighty Zeus couldn't escape what you did to him, and up sprang Athena from his head, the first true goddess that belonged solely to the humans. And then busy little Hermes, Ares and Hephaestus, Apollo and Artemis and that nice boy Dionysus as you became geniuses, started to believe in the afterlife (and pinned us down forever as well), fought each other, made weapons, got high on drugs and made prophecies and thought up all sorts of creative things to do now that you had the time, hunted for fun as well as for food, got drunk and got high again. And Aphrodite as well, promoted from being in heat to lust to the idealistic notion of love. A whole family of gods you made for yourselves, and then gave yourselves over to the mercy of them. And here is the thing; you did not make them to be very merciful, which is why they take great delight in raping you and doing all manner of unspeakable things. Even the nicest of them. Especially the nicest of them. Which brings us back to your infection. Athena, now, a truly lovely girl, such a shame about Prometheus, determined to better mankind, but she's just as capable of cruelty as her father. Actually rather more so, because while they'll both blow their tops when they're angry, the daughter can be much more subtle about getting her own back. You've heard about the trick she pulled on the daughters of Cecrops? And what she did to that priestess of hers that Poseidon screwed? Cold, cold. And Artemis, turning that peeper into a stag and torturing him by having his own hounds chase him down, just because he saw her tits? And Hera, my dear, Hera is a ball of spite and envy on exquisite legs. The male gods get into the act as well, all their jealousies and rivalries and how they turn their frustrations on you. It's the calculated nastiness that really troubles me, the way they choose to draw the punishments out, savoring the torture. There's enough of before in me that it doesn't sit right. When I punished Minthe at least for her it was quick, a scream, a shrivel, a slurp and it was over. Or so I recall. I might have stepped on the plant I turned her into afterward the transformation was complete, and she might still have been aware. It isn't that animals don't unwittingly torture, or that the males don't force the females to submit to them, they do. Cats, now - though I doubt you'll ever see one -, they dearly love to play with their food before eating it. But pain is life when you're an animal, and it leads into death, and that is acceptable. As for whether rape matters as much to an animal, I couldn't tell you. I've never been raped, or if I have, I forgot. Though I don't think I'd ever forget that. Which brings us back to forgetting things. Which brings us back to raped queens. Which brings us back, Pirithous, to you. I know that you forgot a lot of things when you were tricked into sitting down in that chair, Pirithous, and the stone snakes clasped your arms and legs and squeezed your head. Who you are, for instance. Why you came here. Where you came from. Your home. Your friend Theseus, sitting beside you in his own filth and drooling into his lap, and Theseus's bride to be, Helen of Sparta. She's long been rescued by her brothers, you know? And your mother and your sister, Aethra and Phisadie, are her slaves where they were once her captors. But you don't even remember them, do you, you smelly wrinkled old clod, do you? Do you? And you've forgotten how to speak and even how to think, there's nothing in your balding head, and there wasn't much in there even when you weren't sitting here because you thought you could carry off and rape me, me, Queen of the Dead, Queen of Life and Death. I think that though most of you has forgotten there's some tiny part of you in there that remembers how to hear and how to understand my speech, and I think it's screaming, I really do. Shall I tell you one more thing before I go, Pirithous, shall I remind you of something? It's something that's never troubled us much in our solitude down here, but it's very important for you. If you echo us, do we not echo you? Even if we came before you, are we not made in your image, more powerful, beautiful and free? Free to rape or reward or kill. And in return, you are free to shape us. And you did. Think, Pirithous, think. Think how we treated others who came down here. Psyche, who came humble and desperate, who I felt pity for and treated kindly. Orpheus, who charmed us with his music and moved us to tears, to whom I granted a second chance. Heracles, who made his request politely and so was accorded all due respect and permission, who I welcomed as a brother. Animals do not feel such things so well, but with all of those supplicants I felt them so strongly, the pity and the heart break and the fellowship. And you came to rape me, Pirithous. You made me feel angry. You, who barged down here to our realm, you who would have raped me, feel my rage. Feel my cruelty and spite, because that is what a being feels when it is nearly raped. You did that to me, you made me feel this, and you will suffer. Which brings me back to why I'm here. Heracles is coming to rescue you soon. Perhaps by then I will have grown tired of this, and I'll let you go along with Theseus; we have to give him up anyway. Or perhaps I won't, Pirithous. Perhaps I'll give you over to my little girls, my kind and gentle cubs who'll play with you so tenderly, who're so human and yet so utterly before your kind. Or perhaps I will keep you down here and forget about you so that you stop poisoning me with this hate and spite, but you'll still be punished forever. Or perhaps I should just kill you and make an end of it. I don't know what I want, I need to think. Hades, where are you? Come to me, shed your fine clothes and your human skin, your black against my light, and be my mate once more, and wash this human from me.",

      "The male gods get into the act as well, all their jealousies and rivalries and how they turn their frustrations on you.",
      "It's the calculated nastiness that really troubles me, the way they choose to draw the punishments out, savoring the torture.",
      "There's enough of before in me that it doesn't sit right.",
      "When I punished Minthe at least for her it was quick, a scream, a shrivel, a slurp and it was over.",
      "Or so I recall.",
      "I might have stepped on the plant I turned her into afterward the transformation was complete, and she might still have been aware.",
      "It isn't that animals don't unwittingly torture, or that the males don't force the females to submit to them, they do.",
      "Cats, now - though I doubt you'll ever see one -, they dearly love to play with their food before eating it.",
      "But pain is life when you're an animal, and it leads into death, and that is acceptable.",
      "As for whether rape matters as much to an animal, I couldn't tell you.",
      "I've never been raped, or if I have, I forgot.",
      "Though I don't think I'd ever forget that.",
      "Which brings us back to forgetting things.",
      "Which brings us back to raped queens.",
      "Which brings us back, Pirithous, to you.",
      "I know that you forgot a lot of things when you were tricked into sitting down in that chair, Pirithous, and the stone snakes clasped your arms and legs and squeezed your head.",
      "Who you are, for instance.",
      "Why you came here.",
      "Where you came from.",
      "Your home.",
      "Your friend Theseus, sitting beside you in his own filth and drooling into his lap, and Theseus's bride to be, Helen of Sparta.",
      "She's long been rescued by her brothers, you know?",
      "And your mother and your sister, Aethra and Phisadie, are her slaves where they were once her captors.",
      "But you don't even remember them, do you, you smelly wrinkled old clod, do you?",
      "Do you?",
      "And you've forgotten how to speak and even how to think, there's nothing in your balding head, and there wasn't much in there even when you weren't sitting here because you thought you could carry off and rape me, me, Queen of the Dead, Queen of Life and Death.",
      "I think that though most of you has forgotten there's some tiny part of you in there that remembers how to hear and how to understand my speech, and I think it's screaming, I really do.",
      "Shall I tell you one more thing before I go, Pirithous, shall I remind you of something?",
      "It's something that's never troubled us much in our solitude down here, but it's very important for you.",
      "If you echo us, do we not echo you?",
      "Even if we came before you, are we not made in your image, more powerful, beautiful and free?",
      "Free to rape or reward or kill.",
      "And in return, you are free to shape us.",
      "And you did.",
      "Think, Pirithous, think.",
      "Think how we treated others who came down here.",
      "Psyche, who came humble and desperate, who I felt pity for and treated kindly.",
      "Orpheus, who charmed us with his music and moved us to tears, to whom I granted a second chance.",
      "Heracles, who made his request politely and so was accorded all due respect and permission, who I welcomed as a brother.",
      "Animals do not feel such things so well, but with all of those supplicants I felt them so strongly, the pity and the heart break and the fellowship.",
      "And you came to rape me, Pirithous.",
      "You made me feel angry.",
      "You, who barged down here to our realm, you who would have raped me, feel my rage.",
      "Feel my cruelty and spite, because that is what a being feels when it is nearly raped.",
      "You did that to me, you made me feel this, and you will suffer.",
      "Which brings me back to why I'm here.",
      "Heracles is coming to rescue you soon.",
      "Perhaps by then I will have grown tired of this, and I'll let you go along with Theseus; we have to give him up anyway.",
      "Or perhaps I won't, Pirithous.",
      "Perhaps I'll give you over to my little girls, my kind and gentle cubs who'll play with you so tenderly, who're so human and yet so utterly before your kind.",
      "Or perhaps I will keep you down here and forget about you so that you stop poisoning me with this hate and spite, but you'll still be punished forever.",
      "Or perhaps I should just kill you and make an end of it.",
      "I don't know what I want, I need to think.",
      "Hades, where are you?",
      "Come to me, shed your fine clothes and your human skin, your black against my light, and be my mate once more, and wash this human from me."

    "text": "For a stranger, the girl is all alone, talking to herself as she rests under the comfortable half shadow of a tree. No friends to bother, no mother yelling her name, but she's not alone and she's not a little girl anymore, despite of what some may believe. \"You're cheating\" she whispers softly. \"Mother won't be pleased.\" Persephone smiles, as she feels the shadow caress her skin. He became a protection from the sunlight, a very welcomed one. She is always bit tired of the spring, her life was an endless one before he came. Now she wishes for the end of summer and the growing desire of diving into earth. \"Mother won't be pleased\" she repeated for herself. She wants to hear his reply, but she can't. Demeter does a good job blinding her from everything that is dark and cruel. He is both. Little her mother knows that she is becoming both too and so much more. Persephone can be everything she wants to now, but she will never be fully pleased, not until she is able to hear and see her husband even during these long spring days. Hades alone holds this power, to watch her from a far distance, but he is her husband and shall share his secrets, eventually. It's never easy with Hades, the first months were mainly filled with silence, that only increased her despair. Of course he took it the wrong way. She wondered what was the point in stealing her if he didn't want to talk to her... That's what she first assumed, that he wanted a friend. She was too young and did not understand the desires of men, he soon understood that. So Hades watched as she walked through his kingdom. One day, she found a funny looking fruit. She had a hunger she could not fully understand, maybe that fruit from such a strange land could satisfy her. \"You are doing it wrong\" those were his first kind words to her. He seemed amused by her curiosity. Hades sat down next to Persephone, reaching for her hands. The gesture wasn't so kind, maybe he wasn't so used to it. \"You've got to crack it open. See how much easier it gets?\" Hades stared at her as she swallowed the seeds, she stared him back. Those cold grey eyes were almost warm. For a moment she wanted to touch him the same way his fingers slightly touched hers. She didn't though. They settled for the near touch instead. Exactly how they had to right now. Hades was there in that meadow with her at the same time he wasn't. Persephone hoped the nymphs and mortals could keep her mother busy just a little bit longer. She lied down, pretending the grass was her bed in the Underworld. Maybe if she closed her eyes she would be able to see him, she could nearly feel his hands upon her neck. She remembered the first time they lied together in that bed. She thought nothing would happen, since the kidnapping he avoided touching her. Probably to avoid the anger that surprised him so much. She was surprised when he kissed her lips, it was quick and he waited for her reaction afterwards. \"Do you always watch me like this?\" she asked, he didn't answer. She got closer and he pulled her in his arms. He was so strong, this time she wasn't scared. Persephone kissed Hades lips, neck, shoulders... The mortals like to think the pomegranate is what supposedly imprisoned Persephone, that's what her mother spread through the wind. Nobody knows that as Demeter called Hades a rapist, Persephone confronted her mother for the first time. Nobody knows Persephone took his side and held his hand as he held her shoulders with one arm. Zeus made the final decision, he did not ask her what she wanted, but what he decided seemed fair enough. Demeter still can't believe it, Persephone must remain a little girl, even if she's not. \"Little she knows you're a Queen\" Hades whispered later that night, or was it day? Never seemed to matter. Time doesn't matter in the Underworld. \"I miss you.\" Persephone says \"We are life and death. We belong together.\" \"I miss you too\" Hades says from his throne, staring at the empty one next to him. \"Only four more months...\" but she cannot hear him.",

    "text": "For the prompt: Tortall, Daine, autumn. A note: this prompt, as well as those following, are from the excellent 2013 Three Sentence Ficathon on Dreamwidth, which I highly recommend checking out! When Miri wonders why Daine smiles less frequently as the days shorten, she shrugs and grumbles that the cold makes her bones ache more now that she's no longer a girl. When Sarralyn and Rikash demand why Ma is always so grouchy this time of year, she tickles them until they beg for mercy and reminds them that she ought to be hibernating with the other beasts. Numair alone never asks a thing; he already knows that the bandits of Snowsdale always attacked just before the year's first snow. For the prompt: Chuck, Chuck/Sarah, creating new memories. He tries everything at first: dancing the tango at a black-tie charity auction (\"Chuck,\" she asks, blinking a little, \"why are you dancing the woman's part?\"), riding shotgun on one of Casey and Verbanski's missions (...and given that Casey and his girlfriend are apparently now at the stage in their relationship where they're unfamiliar with the concept of TMI, Chuck and Sarah are never doing that again), using a zip line to escape the Buy More (okay, okay, in retrospect, that was a completely stupid idea, just like Sarah had said from the start). After all that work, they're just standing at the sink washing dishes on a Saturday night when Sarah bites her lips and tells him her middle name once again. (Chuck doesn't care.) For the prompt: anyone, anyone, \"the truth is this: / my love for you / is the only empire i will ever build.\" Sounis sends him a map of the known world: a joke from an old friend--or is it a rebuke? Difficult to be sure, between Kings. Gen stares at it and then, for some time, the crown that binds him as firmly as a leash does a dog; he cannot smile until he hears the rustle of skirts that marks Irene's approach, until he feels the brush of her warm lips against his skin. Based on the prompt: The Trojan Women, Andromache/Helen/Hecuba, lost children. Andromache is slumped dry-eyed in a corner, still clutching Astyanax's swaddling clothes, and Helen, Queen once more when the rest of them are slaves, looks blankly out the window towards Sparta where her daughter waits. Hecuba wants to shake them both for their insolence, to demand how they could dare think their grief greater than her own; but instead she goes to her daughters-in-law, and gently strokes their hair. She has lost her sons already; she will not lose her daughters, too. Based on the prompt: Greek/Roman mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, survivor and savior are so similar. By the fifth time he sees her before him, he's guessed the truth; the vision of Cassandra, loveliest of the princesses of Troy, is as beautiful as he remembers, but its eyes are sad and far more lucid than they ever were in life. He means to say, first my Creusa, and now you?, but instead: \"I wish I could have saved you.\" The phantom laughs (and that, oh that, is exactly as he remembers) as it--as she whispers in the shell of his ear: \"Then survive, my Aeneas; tell my story to the rest of the world, and let me live through you.\" For the prompt: Greek Mythology, Helen, my graceless heart. A princess of Achaea must have certain expectations for her heart: it is to be spacious, so as to accommodate her husband and his hall and every last one of his flaws; it is to be hard as stone, so as to never allow distractions to enter; and it is to be steady and immutable through all the years, so as to never change in a way her family dislikes. Under no circumstances, Helen knows without having to ask, is it to value gossiping in the gardens with her cousins and sisters over sitting in silence beside her husband; nor is it to seek to make her Hermione more than just yet another trophy to be exchanged for land, wealth, or power; nor is it to yearn for things unknown and untold. Her flight with Paris is due far less to fickleness and far more to despair than anyone ever suspects. For the prompt: Narnia/Merlin, Morgana, Andrew's godmother Mrs. LeFay. Obviously a crossover with the Chronicles of Narnia, and ignores certain elements of 5x13. Every few decades, she finds someone who reminds her of Merlin--sometimes it's as simple as noticing something about the ears, sometimes as devastating as finding poison behind a puppyish facade--and when she does, she always, always helps them along their destiny. \"Promise me,\" she urges this latest version, a tall thin lad named Andrew, \" that you'll burn it once I'm dead\"; as he swears an oath he clearly has no intention to keep, it's all she can do not to smile through her ailing, decrepit glamour. (The easiest way to have your revenge on someone is to give them the tools of their own destruction and then do nothing--Merlin taught her that all too well.) For the prompt: Any, any, if I loved you less, I could talk about it more. Despite what his brother might think, Christopher is not as hopeless at matters of romance as one might expect; he spends hours in the carriage back to Elvenwood Hall planning out what he might say to Kate when he sees her again and debating with Alicia over the relative merits of starting with you've ensnared me beyond all hope and reason as compared to I don't suppose I'll find another woman willing to build the manor up from nothing, so why don't we accept the inevitable? Before he realizes it, they've arrived, and Kate stands before him in sapphires and bronze: this extraordinary woman who saved him in more ways than one, this champion who even the Fairy Folk fear, this marvel who he's belonged to since the day he met her. His fine words turn to dust before her. For the prompt: Greek mythology, Clytemnestra, I must go on standing/you can't break that/which isn't yours When the news comes that her husband has fallen in battle, Clytemnestra rocks her son to sleep for the last time as the most loyal of her servants wait for her command; she knows all too well what happens to the sons of vanquished men, and the only way she will survive this is if even she forgets that the child had once been hers. When Agamemnon bursts into the hall of Tantalus, Clytemnestra is warm and gracious; when he asks her to marry him, she is coy but receptive; when he begs her to forgive him, driven by wine and guilt, she smiles. \"Don't you want to know his name?\" she asks him only once, months later when her belly swells again, and, without waiting for his response: \"I called him Orestes.\" \"And they lived happily ever after,\" Fiona quotes the night Polly phones her about the engagement. Polly stiffens, a childhood full of Hero and Tan Coul's adventures having taught her how to properly interpret that phase: happily even though they'd be better served accepting their worry and grief, happily even though their artificial delight led each to grow to hate the other, happily even though Laurel lured them both into her clutches again. \"Not in Nowhere,\" she says firmly. For the prompt: Historical RPF, Richard III (+/any), for the cost is too high not to love \"Can you not think what people would speculate were the Prince's widow to marry again?\" Despite his assurance, George cannot meet his brother's eyes. \"No; what's best for her--for all of us--is to live out her years with me and Isabel.\" But Richard remembers Anne's smile, her quiet understanding, the delicate bones of her face; and, try as he might, he cannot agree. From the prompt: Greek mythology, Ariadne/Dionysus, I want to drink you soberAlso: from Alexander Pope's \"An Essay on Criticism,\" taken wildly out of context: A little learning is a dang'rous thing;/Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:/There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,/And drinking largely sobers us again. Her hair is matted, her face is dirty, her eyes are wet with tears, and still something about her calls to him. The worshippers at his temple chatter about Ariadne, traitor to Crete, utterly undone by shame and grief; he had sought her out only to satisfy his own curiosity, to see for himself how such a woman might be, but now--now things are very different. He takes a steadying gulp from his winecup and holds out the rest to her, to take if she so chooses: \"Drink deep, my girl.\" From the prompt: Greek/Roman Mythology, Dido, \"And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones./'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone\" Once they arrive, those who follow the pitiful princess, stripped of birthright and bridal bed by her wicked brother, are surprised at how capably she rules; not flawlessly, of course, but their Queen remains impervious to every setback, learns quickly from her mistakes, even has the wits and the equanimity to carry off the trick of the oxhide. They shower her with compliments, and in return she forces the smile she's long forgotten how to make with any real sincerity. Acerbus is dead, and, somewhere along the way to Carthage, so is Elissa; only Dido remains. For the prompt: Greek/Roman mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, playing favorites Even as a child in Dardania, Aeneas had heard of his (fortunately, his father grumbles whenever the tales of her latest tantrum arrive) very, very distant cousin Cassandra, so often that he could picture her wild dark hair and the angry curl of her mouth without ever seeing her, and now, seated at Priam's own table at the wedding feast of Hektor and the Princess of Thebe, he cannot be blamed for his curious looks in her direction. As he watches, Cassandra twists away from the tight grip of her unsmiling brother Deiphobus and dances to the groom's side, keeping her face serene as Hektor sneaks her extra sweetmeats; when she meets Aeneas's gaze, her eyes sparkle with the silent shared joke. Aeneas swallows and quickly reconsiders his preconceptions about the Princess of Troy. Follows directly from the previous fill. Once they've been introduced, Cassandra takes his hands and spins him around in a wild circle; she says, \"You'll marry, and marry, and marry, but you won't marry me.\" Aeneas gives a startled little cough--it's ridiculous, of course, he doesn't intend on taking more than one wife, and certainly not the pitiful mad princess (even if she is less pitiable and less mad and more charming than he had expected) and gods help him, he is still holding Cassandra's hands. \"I wish you would,\" Cassandra whispers, her eyes wide. For the prompt: The Mummy, Rick/Evy, misadventures in parenting Going into it, Rick knew a life with the Carnahans would be rather less soothing than a retired ex-Legionnaire who's seen his fill of war might want; if it's not Jonathan pissing off the law, the criminal underworld, usually both at once, it's Evelyn stumbling across the one scroll in the entire country that sets off a centuries-old curse that brings on great calamity, the goddamn apocalypse, blah blah blah, and usually also means they have to put up Ardeth Bey for a few days until the fate of the world is no longer in danger. It's just--when Evy tells him she's pregnant, Rick has a few months to imagine his kid as the only other sane influence in this family; admittedly, he grew up in a hellhole of an orphanage that he escaped as soon as humanly possible, but he has some faint impressions of normal children doing things like playing ball and skipping school and saying \"Dada\" a whole lot. A year and a half later, though: \"Ramesses,\" pronounces baby Alex with a look of great contentment when it comes time for his first word, and Rick abandons any hope for a normal life. From the prompt: Greek mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, we're being pulled apart by the arc of history She finds him on a balcony, the night before the wedding, and comes to stand beside him. \"Creusa is my favorite of my grown-up sisters,\" she tells him gently, \"you will love her very much.\" She's not you, Aeneas wants to but cannot say; and he hates himself for it all the more. From the prompt: The Mummy, Rick/Evy, telling secrets Not for the first time, Jonathan considers locking his baby sister and her husband in the brig and making a run for it. \"I'm sorry,\" Rick barks from one side of the airship, \"you pick now, after we've just escaped with our lives--\" (from mummies, Jonathan supplies) \"--after you returned from the dead--\" (fortunately not as a mummy) \"--to tell me you kissed...him--(oh, another mummy; what a surprise!) \"--back in the desert eleven years ago.\" Evie just raises her chin and retorts, \"It seemed like a good idea at the time.\" For the prompt: Greek mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, the dark never enters/but it also never leaves/and the spark that he gave you/is just an ember, all but out Here and now, on a rare picnic with Aeneas as he describes the strange sights he saw on his last campaign, she's safe. He turns to her, takes her hand, smiles (and oh, how it warms her heart, but he will smile like that, in that sad, uncertain way, at Lavinia when he searches for her face in the crowd after he's slain her intended, at Dido as the first winds fill his sails to take him away from Carthage, at Creusa when he stretches out a hand towards her phantom amidst the rubble of Troy, oh her sisters, oh her city, oh, the Achaeans approach and with them, Agamemmon of the blood-stained hands and Iphigenia's hungry ghost and the rage of Clytemnestra and the bathing hall and the labrys)--and asks, with the undercurrent of fright that never fails to remind her where they will always go wrong: \"Cassandra, what is it?\" \"Nothing,\" she replies, because she is always safe and never safe, always truthful, always a liar, \"tell me another story, my friend.\" For the prompt: Greek mythology, any (+/any), the Trojan War, come, attrition/come, the reek of bones/come, attrition/come, hell When Eris comes to her and demands how best to avenge the insult, of course Psyche gives her the idea for the apple, for she has precious few allies among her husband's family as it is, and his aunt, though unpopular, is not one to cross; only later is she able to force herself to reflect on what must come next. She'll have to introduce a human into the fray to divert the gods' attention and draw their anger, of course; the war to come will be thick with the stench of bones and the drip of blood, -- but how much more terrible to imagine the same horrors descending on pristine Olympus!- and far better, she thinks, to destroy one city rather than the world. Psyche hides her face with her hands for shame and wonders when she began to think as an immortal. For the prompt: Greek Mythology, Oenone/Paris, \"oh will we pass the test/or just as one loves more and more/will one love less and less\" When things are simple, when she is the best healer on Mount Ida and he the impudent shepherd who would injure himself for an excuse to come see her, she laughs off his protestations of undying devotion. As the years go by, and their love withers, she wonders if it would not have been better if she had accepted him at first, if she could have given them more days of happiness together before he chose a princehood and a goddess instead of her, if she might have saved them the pain that was to come; she will not let herself blame him because there, she knows, her destruction lies in wait. But when things are simple again, when he is a patient in need, and she bound by her vows of impartiality, she refuses him once more; this time, she betrays her own ideals, and that she cannot forgive. Or an alternate explanation as to where Helen got those nifty herbs in the Odyssey. The jangle of Trojan-made bracelets warns her of the visitor to her cave, but Oenone, busy at work, doesn't look up from her mortar and pestle. \"If this is about Alexandros,\" she drawls instead, \"I have to warn you that I don't accept returns from unhappy customers.\" A laugh, and: \"Not at all,\" says Helen of the graceful hands, pulling her shining veil from her face, \"they say you're unmatched when it comes to healing, and so I've come to learn what I can.\" For the prompt: Chronicles of Chrestomanci, Rosa Montana, when you're the eldest of three sisters... When you're the eldest of three sisters, you run a disproportionately high chance of making bad choices and coming to worse ends, most ly caused by years of having to set a good example for your younger siblings; Rosa Montana, having received an excellent education and in possession of a horde of undignified scamps for brothers and sisters and cousins, is well aware of this fact and all the more determined to avoid it. She says her prayers every night, makes sure her clothing is arranged just so, never takes it into her head to sing a spell she can't pull off alone; she washes behind her ears, tries to only be sarcastic to those who deserve it, and never conducts herself in a manner befitting a Petrocchi. It's not until the Old Bridge, when she catches a glimpse of her fellow--her rival worker, that she thinks: Well, if I must-- what a way to go. For the prompt: Chronicles of Chrestomanci, Anthea Tesdinic/ or & Robert Brown, take your fast car and keep on driving \"Can I give you a lift?\" asks the Count once class is out, sticking his terribly handsome head out the window of his sports car. Anthea bites her lip, considering; she already knows what Mum would say, but anyway, she's not Mum (thank God!) and Robert seems a decent sort who didn't give her up earlier when he noticed her doodling sketches of evening gowns in the margins of her notes, not to mention the fact that she's got a meeting with a famous dress designer on the opposite side of town in fifteen minutes that she can only just make if she keeps on walking. \"Only if you're fast enough to suit me,\" she says, and smiles. For the prompt: Greek mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, take me out to sea/away from you and me \"Othryoneus of Cabesos has promised us his allegiance,\" Aeneas pauses, struggling to find the right words to announce this diplomatic triumph, \" in exchange for the chance to make his regard known to the Princess Cassandra.\" Priam's eyes shine with triumph; his daughter Creusa's smile (...and how had Aeneas never noticed her before, as kind and good as she is?) wavers with sympathy; and Cassandra's expression is as inscrutable as it has ever been. \"I will also,\" he adds as an afterthought, \"return to Dardania with the morning tide.\" For the prompt: Greek Mythology, Cassiopeia and Andromeda, like mother like daughter After the coronation, Perseus turns to her with an expression of pure panic; he was raised to be useful in a fisherman's hut, her husband, and when he speaks, she already knows what to expect: \"I--I don't know what to do now.\" But unlike him, Andromeda was born the daughter of Cassiopeia of Aethiopia, who took the forgotten port of Joppa and turned it into a marvel that even the gods envied; who encouraged her sturdy ships and brave captains to explore every corner of the known world; who married an insignificant son of Egypt and transformed him into a king worthy to sit beside her. \"Fortunately for you,\" she says, smiling, \"I do.\" For the prompt: Greek mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, 'there's nothing we cannot ever fix,' I said/can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way \"Don't worry,\" he assures her, slapping his hand on the stones below to emphasize his point, \"the walls of Troy will never fall as long as Priam rules, as long as Hektor lives, as long as I fight to protect you--to protect all of you.\" Cassandra flinches from his words as though from a physical blow. \"Be that as it may,\" she says, in an unhappy, urgent voice, \"the day they do--if they do--swear to me you'll take your wife and your son and anyone else you choose and you'll run\"; he cannot understand (he rarely does, when it comes to her) but then again, she has never asked him for anything else before. For the prompt: Greek Mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, but I would let you hold me in your hands/we would get to be together once again/and you would never ever try to pretend that I was yours/when I was yours Cassie has: a house empty of brothers, a mountain of student debts, a face that no longer belongs to one of the most beautiful women in the world. Cassie has: a head empty of visions, admission to graduate school, a boyfriend who lets her spin him around in the year's first rain and never lets go. Cassandra is content....And the dreaded fourth sentence catches up with me! For the prompt: Howl's Moving Castle, Howl/Sophie, \"Vanity thy name is wizard\" Sophie likes her new brother-in-law very much, if not quite as much as Michael, but she has to admit it is sometimes rather awkward trying to start conversation with someone you first knew as a man-turned-dog you'd adopted--or rather, half a man-turned-dog. Sophie, though, is far too strong-minded these days to balk at awkwardness, and besides, Ben is a wizard who comes from the same world Howl does and might be able to shed some light on their strange customs. \"Do you spend two hours every morning getting ready in the bathroom too?\" she asks frankly. Ben raises his eyebrows with an air of polite befuddlement, and Sophie can't help but groan; only her wizard, it seems. For the prompt: Chronicles of Pyrdian; Eilonwy +/ Taran; not a bauble The new lords of Prydain think of Queen Eilonwy exactly as she once used to think of her bauble: proof of a royal heritage, an excellent way to start a conversation about golden beauty if you couldn't think of anything else, but, ultimately, rather useless. At night, she fumes, \"It's like asking for beeswax and getting honey instead!\"; her husband, still looking rather overwhelmed from the sums necessary to determine the state of the treasury, only nods in reply. It's not until Taran goes south to supervise the final stages of rebuilding of Mona, leaving Eilonwy in charge, and a ragged troop of bandits attacks that she is able to show them what's she's truly made of; then, rather enjoying the looks on their faces as she lowers her sword, Eilonwy says, very sweetly: \"Please don't worry, my lords; your lives are safe in my hands.\" For the prompt: Greek Mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, you wake up in the bed you make/I think you made a big mistake He considers, once, what it would mean to ask Priam for his daughter's hand (as a mere hypothetical exercise), outlines in his mind the endless negotiations of what Dardania might bring to the alliance and what Troy might grant in return, prepares his vows of eternal love for their princess. That would be the easy part, of course; far more difficult would be explaining his choice of bride to his father, declaring with an assurance he did not feel that her madness would not pass on to their children, praying as he presented his wife to his countrymen that one of her strange fits would not overtake her--far more difficult, and far more painful. Later that night, he asks Cassandra for nothing more than her company at dinner. For the prompt: Harry Potter; Lily Evans; magical artifact (Sreaf stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi) Lily's not entirely sure why the Head Girl has to be the one to personally guard one of the paired mirrors that Dumbledore wants to study over Easter holidays, but Professor Flitwick asked himself, and he's such a darling that she can't possibly refuse him, any more than she can help ignoring his warning and taking a peek at what this fabled mirror has to show once she's alone. She sees: an underfed little boy in pajamas, with James's face and her eyes, standing all alone, face pressed to the glass--staring back at her as though at a stranger. With a shudder, she covers it again. For the prompt: Elementary, Joan, childhood Joanie gets straight As and smiley-faces on all her report cards, but sometimes she gets other notes, scrawled into the margins for her parents to read; she looks anyway, since no matter how much her teachers tell her it's not polite to snoop, she figures it must not count if it's about you. It's nothing real interesting, just more about how Joanie needs to work on minding her manners (by which they mean she pointed out Miss Thomas was going to have a baby soon, seeing as how she keeps on smiling at baby pictures and carrying tiny socks in her bag and throwing up an awful lot, just like Mama did before Oren was born), and she knows Mama and Daddy will give her another long lecture on the subject when they get home. \"I was kind of a weird kid,\" she admits with a laugh years later, \"it's probably a good thing I grew out of it\" (and no one, except maybe Sherlock, notices that she can never meet their eyes when she does). For the prompt: Harry Potter, Lupin/Tonks, full moon fever \"All right, Tonks?\" calls Savage with real concern as Tonks gets up from her seat at the Leaky Cauldron. \"You've been looking peak...ier recently and you felt warm; don't tell me you've chosen now to come down with 'flu!\" Tonks ignores him as she heads up the stairs, having more important things to worry about than Savage's hypochondriac tendencies; Remus might not want to be with her anymore, fine, but he could let her know Greyback hasn't torn his mind, body, or soul apart yet; and even if he doesn't owe her that much, he could at least send word that he's survived another full moon. She is surprised but not alarmed to find the twin to her own Patronus waiting for her in her rooms, and disappointed but not surprised that its only words are a warning about the impending attack on the Montgomery house; as she turns away to grab her cloak and Apparate, however, it lunges near to nuzzle her cheek before it disappears. For the prompt: Greek Mythology, Creusa and Cassandra, I had a sister lovely in my sightAlso, this is a companion fic to ViaLethe's take on the same prompt, available here. I also heartily recommend all of her 3SF collections! Cassandra is her favorite sister, which is not an uncommon opinion amongst the children of Priam--almost everyone wants to be known for their kindness towards poor, tormented Cassandra, but only Helenus and Hektor and Creusa manage it with any sort of sincerity; they are old enough to remember Cassandra before the curse settled upon her, before it turned her expression hard and distant and her smile a rare and cutting thing. Creusa knows this and pities her sister, but there are times she envies her, too, resents with uncharacteristic fury the passion that illuminates Cassandra's face, the way all eyes follow where she goes, and most of all, the way immortality hangs over her; as long as men live, they will remember Cassandra, and as long as other lovely maidens are present to adore, they will forget Creusa. \"You deserve better, sister,\" Cassandra says, in that sweet simple way of hers, and Creusa thinks no, no, she really doesn't. For the prompt: Ancient History, Artemisia of Caria, devotion With her name, she is consecrated to the ways of the wild, to the love of the hunt and the chase of a challenge--and she finds all her longing fulfilled on the battlefield: her namesake pursued animals, and she runs her enemies to ground; her namesake was unrivaled in honor, and so she longs to be; her namesake expects great things of her, and so too will she. \"We commend your devotion,\" proclaims Xerxes, shining in his armor, and she sees he imagines all her service is done only in his name; that is all that gives him the confidence to dismiss her counsel about how to deal with the Greeks as though it had no worth in his eyes. How fortunate she has more demanding patrons to please. For the prompt: Ancient History, Candaules' wife, I will protect my own honor When she was a young princess in her father's court, her mother spoke to her of honor, and it seemed to her a fragile thing, to be sheltered from the world outside at all costs, until the day her husband and her family would claim it for their own. She had always been a clever child, if nothing else, and had been able to interpret her mother's words accurately: don't cause trouble, my dear, or the world will look at you askew. Now, however, her honor seems to her a sharper, stronger thing, one that matters because of how it appears to her own eyes rather than those of others, and she protects it because it is hers and hers alone; the thought gives her courage, and she leans forward and snaps: \"My terms are simple, guardsman: his life, or yours.\" For the prompt: Historical RPF, Richard III/Anne Neville, I will dance with you on our wedding day When she complains, as a child, of her dancing lessons, he tells her she must learn, so as to dance with him on their wedding day; it is a joke, in a very Richard-like way, by which she means that he says it in so dry a tone that nearly three-quarters of the ears set to listening to all they say (far too many, here in the Earl of Warwick's household) believe he's serious, no matter how outrageous his words might be. But joke or not, he says it nevertheless, and implies a world of possibilities with his words; if ever Anne had any fault (and she does, she does, too many to count), it has always been to believe Richard wholeheartedly, come what may. Years later, when they clear the dishes away from the wedding feast, and Edward reaches expectantly for her hand, she can't help but look for Richard, foolish though it may be. For the prompt: Any, any, I din't know about you/but I'm feeling 22 (Taylor Swift, \"22\") \"How does it feel,\" Lily asks from her comfortable sprawl on the other end of the sofa, \"to be madly in love with an older woman?\" \"Older?\" James snorts, out of habit rather than derision; this is a familiar joke between them, after all. \"Last time I checked, Mrs. Potter, you're only twenty-one, same as me.\" \"I'll be twenty-two in just three months, thank you very much, and tonight I feel it,\" she says, sitting straight to kiss him on the nose; it's hardly surprising, this mood of hers, since Halloween has always been Lily's favorite holiday, \"Now watch Harry for a bit while I run upstairs, won't you, love?\" For the prompt: Greek mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, and can you see the means without the end/in the random frantic action that we take? Cassandra is, objectively, the wisest person he knows; never does she perform any action without calculating every consequence,weighing any potential advantage that might be gained. This is why it is such a surprise when, the night before Paris is due to return from enjoying the Spartan king's hospitality, she finds him, clutches his hands, and begs: \"Stay with me tonight.\" They sit by her hearth together--and that is all, or at least all that those who hope for gossip would be able to see--talking of nothing until the sky pales and Eos rises; he does not ask the question, but still she breathes, \"This means more to me than you will ever believe.\" For the prompt: Greek Mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, I wish you could remind me who I was/because every day I'm a little further off After losing Creusa, he thinks, she will never forgive me; after deserting Dido, he thinks, she would never approve of this; after turning his courtship of Lavinia into bloody warfare, he thinks, she would have found a better way. It is only when he founds his small city and protects his people that he feels himself again: that shining Prince Aeneas that she knew and smiled to see. This is what Cassandra becomes to him, in the end: not wife, not lover, but instead that unattainable pinnacle by which he measures his own worth. For the prompt: A:tla/Harry Potter, Sokka & Ron, strategists \"This official meeting of the Meat and Sarcasm Society will now come to order,\" announces the bloke with the ponytail, tapping a gavel on the table before him even though it's just the two of them there, and Ron tries not to feel as though he's been bamboozled into joining the interdimensional equivalent of S.P.E.W. Sure, the food's not bad, and table manners don't seem to matter much, but mostly, this bloke--Sokka--has the best head for strategizing he's ever seen, even though he doesn't seem to have heard of chess before; Ron hasn't enjoyed a game more in years, particularly not since his primary pool of competitors became Harry and Hermione, who, clever as they are in other ways, have yet to come up with a gambit Ron couldn't outthink in a matter of minutes. Still. The moment Sokka pulls out that fake beard again, Ron's leaving, brilliant chess games be damned. For the prompt: Much Ado About Nothing, Beatrice/Benedick, so go ahead, push your luck/say what it is you've got to say to me A strange soldier stands in their hall, twirling an arrow in his hands lazily, and her uncle frowns when he catches her noticing him; \"Signor Benedick of Padua,\" he explains in response to her questioning look, \"from whom you'd best stay away, niece; he has a tongue sharp enough to wound the most stalwart of men.\" But Beatrice has been coddled and protected as long as she can remember, the only remnant of the great romance between Leonato's brother and his pale, sad-eyed wife, and if this Signor Benedick will speak plainly if roughly to her, so much the better; she tires of pity in the eyes of all she meets, tires of gentleness afforded to her simply because she is her generous uncle's unfortunate niece, and so she shrugs away Leonato's restraining hand on her shoulder: \"Let him say what he likes to me, Uncle; I'll return it to him doubled.\" She's young enough to believe her own bravado. For the prompt: Greek Mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, underneath this sky/you have loved and lied/and diverted your gaze from my delicate ways/and my fragile smile \"This can never happen again,\" says Cassandra solemnly once she has enough breath to speak, but her lips betray her with a smile. \"Absolutely not,\" Aeneas agrees, and in contrast to her, guilt still lingers in his expression--this should not be happening, and certainly not with Cassandra; \"for one thing, your father would never forgive me, and for another--\" \"There's Hektor,\" she finishes with a laugh, and they turn their attention back to the problem of how to return the horses they borrowed to the royal pastures in companionable silence. For the prompt: Greek Mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, every time anybody speaks your name/I still feel the same/I ache, I ache, I ache inside Collateral damage, they call her in Carthage; whisper about how the King of Mycenae returned with his war-prize to his embittered wife, how the Trojan bondslave bore the consequences of Clytemnestra's rage along with Agamemnon, and he wants to shout to the skies just how much she mattered to Troy, to the royal family, to him. Victim, repeat the rumors in Latium; they warn of her curse, how she offended the gods and was betrayed by them, how she spent her every lonely hour waiting for Troy's doom to descend, and he wants to remind them of her smiles, of her laughter, of the fact that he himself eventually learned to see beyond her madness, if late, too late. Heroine, he says when he grows too old for the battlefield and the children demand a story of his youth; he tells of a woman who made it her business to live because Troy would not, who was never believed but saved as many as she could, whose name even he is hardly worthy of uttering (whose name he will never forget, no matter how much it hurts). For the prompt: The Blue Castle, Barney/Valancy, cool water Moonlight quotes John Foster at him as they sit by the brook, almost as though she can't help it; very likely she can't, though her passion deserves words from a nobler pen than that of an embittered apothecary's son. But all the same, what harm can it do? he thinks; Valancy has had all too few joys in her life, and if this moment reciting the prose of a man who doesn't exist by cool water will make up one of them, he can spare it easily enough. Barney closes his eyes, his head resting on her lap, and tries not to remember how many moments make up a year. For the prompt: Doctor Who, Doctor/Any, love is a complicated thing for him When he tells her in a broken whisper that he can't live without her, his wife, the one Gallifreyan in known history with the cheek to refuse the Academy's invitation, grumbles, \"You Time Lords, always so sure you're the only ones who've unlocked the key to immortality,\"--and if her voice is soft these days, the tone of irritation he hears in it is not; \"I will,\" she says, with a faith he can't understand, \"always be with you.\" Immediately after the funeral, he takes a TARDIS and his granddaughter and sets out into the universe to find her, and find her he does: in Romana's asperity and Sarah Jane's endurance; in Jamie's loyalty and Jack's determination; in Grace's cleverness and River's shameless flaunting of the rules, and after all, she always loved roses. She is right (she is always right): he is never alone. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) At first she jokes she left her job because she was tired of explaining that her name was Joan, not Joy; and when that doesn't work, she tries to pretend it's her life's new calling to help new trainers master their Pokemon--better that than trying to explain the crippling guilt of watching a patient fade as its ten-year-old trainer watches in horror. And then she meets Sherlock, scion of Celadon City's wealthiest family who's left home with his Squirtle to make a name for himself thirty years late; or at least that's what she thinks until, outside Viridian City's deserted gym, he breaks his sulky silence to pull out a lockpick and pronounce: \"Well, here we are.\" She just looks at him in surprise, and Sherlock huffs out an exasperated breath; \"Don't tell me,\" he demands (and some tiny part of Joan recognizes, even then, that her life will never be the same again), \"you haven't heard of an organization called Team Rocket?\" For the prompt: Any, any, kids cartoon AU For the prompt: Any, any, kids cartoon AU(Medieval History + Pokemon) Richard is proud of his Emboar, and well should he be; the Lancasters's Pokemon all bear the marks of its claws, and he owes every one of the hard-earned badges pinned to his shirt to Emboar's resilience. Even Ned's Sunflora, splendid as it is in high noon, takes some effort to challenge it; and the less said of George's Tauros, the better. But sometimes, between battles and contests, he remembers his Tepig, still small enough in those days for Anne to hold in her arms and absentmindedly caress as she listened to him describe his ambitions for hours, and he feels just the slightest pang of longing. Bonus unprompted continuation of the last fic, because the plot bunny bit me and I couldn't say no. He's known what to expect of the Elite Four as long as he can remember, his one goal to defeat them before they destroy his family: there's Edward, who favors Fighting Pokemon, William with his affinity for Ice and Water, Somerset, who's never met a Psychic Pokemon he couldn't twist to dangerous ends, and last but certainly not least, Margaret and her carefully trained team of Dark Pokemon. This is why it is such a terrible surprise when he steps into the hall of his final challenger before he can be declared Champion, and finds the one woman he never expected to see in this Lancaster-infested building staring back at him. \"I'm sorry,\" mouths Anne as she fumbles at her belt, or perhaps he only imagines it; either way, it doesn't matter: her Rapidash is free of its Pokeball and furious, racing towards him with its horn pointed at his heart.",

      "Now, however, her honor seems to her a sharper, stronger thing, one that matters because of how it appears to her own eyes rather than those of others, and she protects it because it is hers and hers alone; the thought gives her courage, and she leans forward and snaps: \"My terms are simple, guardsman: his life, or yours.\"",
      "For the prompt: Historical RPF, Richard III/Anne Neville, I will dance with you on our wedding day When she complains, as a child, of her dancing lessons, he tells her she must learn, so as to dance with him on their wedding day; it is a joke, in a very Richard-like way, by which she means that he says it in so dry a tone that nearly three-quarters of the ears set to listening to all they say (far too many, here in the Earl of Warwick's household) believe he's serious, no matter how outrageous his words might be.",
      "But joke or not, he says it nevertheless, and implies a world of possibilities with his words; if ever Anne had any fault (and she does, she does, too many to count), it has always been to believe Richard wholeheartedly, come what may.",
      "Years later, when they clear the dishes away from the wedding feast, and Edward reaches expectantly for her hand, she can't help but look for Richard, foolish though it may be.",
      "For the prompt: Any, any, I din't know about you/but I'm feeling 22 (Taylor Swift, \"22\") \"How does it feel,\" Lily asks from her comfortable sprawl on the other end of the sofa, \"to be madly in love with an older woman?\" \"Older?\" James snorts, out of habit rather than derision; this is a familiar joke between them, after all.",
      "\"Last time I checked, Mrs. Potter, you're only twenty-one, same as me.\"",
      "\"I'll be twenty-two in just three months, thank you very much, and tonight I feel it,\" she says, sitting straight to kiss him on the nose; it's hardly surprising, this mood of hers, since Halloween has always been Lily's favorite holiday, \"Now watch Harry for a bit while I run upstairs, won't you, love?\"",
      "For the prompt: Greek mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, and can you see the means without the end/in the random frantic action that we take?",
      "Cassandra is, objectively, the wisest person he knows; never does she perform any action without calculating every consequence,weighing any potential advantage that might be gained.",
      "This is why it is such a surprise when, the night before Paris is due to return from enjoying the Spartan king's hospitality, she finds him, clutches his hands, and begs: \"Stay with me tonight.\"",
      "They sit by her hearth together--and that is all, or at least all that those who hope for gossip would be able to see--talking of nothing until the sky pales and Eos rises; he does not ask the question, but still she breathes, \"This means more to me than you will ever believe.\"",
      "For the prompt: Greek Mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, I wish you could remind me who I was/because every day I'm a little further off After losing Creusa, he thinks, she will never forgive me; after deserting Dido, he thinks, she would never approve of this; after turning his courtship of Lavinia into bloody warfare, he thinks, she would have found a better way.",
      "It is only when he founds his small city and protects his people that he feels himself again: that shining Prince Aeneas that she knew and smiled to see.",
      "This is what Cassandra becomes to him, in the end: not wife, not lover, but instead that unattainable pinnacle by which he measures his own worth.",
      "For the prompt: A:tla/Harry Potter, Sokka & Ron, strategists \"This official meeting of the Meat and Sarcasm Society will now come to order,\" announces the bloke with the ponytail, tapping a gavel on the table before him even though it's just the two of them there, and Ron tries not to feel as though he's been bamboozled into joining the interdimensional equivalent of S.P.E.W. Sure, the food's not bad, and table manners don't seem to matter much, but mostly, this bloke--Sokka--has the best head for strategizing he's ever seen, even though he doesn't seem to have heard of chess before; Ron hasn't enjoyed a game more in years, particularly not since his primary pool of competitors became Harry and Hermione, who, clever as they are in other ways, have yet to come up with a gambit Ron couldn't outthink in a matter of minutes.",
      "Still.",
      "The moment Sokka pulls out that fake beard again, Ron's leaving, brilliant chess games be damned.",
      "For the prompt: Much Ado About Nothing, Beatrice/Benedick, so go ahead, push your luck/say what it is you've got to say to me A strange soldier stands in their hall, twirling an arrow in his hands lazily, and her uncle frowns when he catches her noticing him; \"Signor Benedick of Padua,\" he explains in response to her questioning look, \"from whom you'd best stay away, niece; he has a tongue sharp enough to wound the most stalwart of men.\"",
      "But Beatrice has been coddled and protected as long as she can remember, the only remnant of the great romance between Leonato's brother and his pale, sad-eyed wife, and if this Signor Benedick will speak plainly if roughly to her, so much the better; she tires of pity in the eyes of all she meets, tires of gentleness afforded to her simply because she is her generous uncle's unfortunate niece, and so she shrugs away Leonato's restraining hand on her shoulder: \"Let him say what he likes to me, Uncle; I'll return it to him doubled.\"",
      "She's young enough to believe her own bravado.",
      "For the prompt: Greek Mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, underneath this sky/you have loved and lied/and diverted your gaze from my delicate ways/and my fragile smile \"This can never happen again,\" says Cassandra solemnly once she has enough breath to speak, but her lips betray her with a smile.",
      "\"Absolutely not,\" Aeneas agrees, and in contrast to her, guilt still lingers in his expression--this should not be happening, and certainly not with Cassandra; \"for one thing, your father would never forgive me, and for another--\" \"There's Hektor,\" she finishes with a laugh, and they turn their attention back to the problem of how to return the horses they borrowed to the royal pastures in companionable silence.",
      "For the prompt: Greek Mythology, Aeneas/Cassandra, every time anybody speaks your name/I still feel the same/I ache, I ache, I ache inside Collateral damage, they call her in Carthage; whisper about how the King of Mycenae returned with his war-prize to his embittered wife, how the Trojan bondslave bore the consequences of Clytemnestra's rage along with Agamemnon, and he wants to shout to the skies just how much she mattered to Troy, to the royal family, to him.",
      "Victim, repeat the rumors in Latium; they warn of her curse, how she offended the gods and was betrayed by them, how she spent her every lonely hour waiting for Troy's doom to descend, and he wants to remind them of her smiles, of her laughter, of the fact that he himself eventually learned to see beyond her madness, if late, too late.",
      "Heroine, he says when he grows too old for the battlefield and the children demand a story of his youth; he tells of a woman who made it her business to live because Troy would not, who was never believed but saved as many as she could, whose name even he is hardly worthy of uttering (whose name he will never forget, no matter how much it hurts).",
      "For the prompt: The Blue Castle, Barney/Valancy, cool water Moonlight quotes John Foster at him as they sit by the brook, almost as though she can't help it; very likely she can't, though her passion deserves words from a nobler pen than that of an embittered apothecary's son.",
      "But all the same, what harm can it do?",
      "he thinks; Valancy has had all too few joys in her life, and if this moment reciting the prose of a man who doesn't exist by cool water will make up one of them, he can spare it easily enough.",
      "Barney closes his eyes, his head resting on her lap, and tries not to remember how many moments make up a year.",
      "For the prompt: Doctor Who, Doctor/Any, love is a complicated thing for him When he tells her in a broken whisper that he can't live without her, his wife, the one Gallifreyan in known history with the cheek to refuse the Academy's invitation, grumbles, \"You Time Lords, always so sure you're the only ones who've unlocked the key to immortality,\"--and if her voice is soft these days, the tone of irritation he hears in it is not; \"I will,\" she says, with a faith he can't understand, \"always be with you.\"",
      "Immediately after the funeral, he takes a TARDIS and his granddaughter and sets out into the universe to find her, and find her he does: in Romana's asperity and Sarah Jane's endurance; in Jamie's loyalty and Jack's determination; in Grace's cleverness and River's shameless flaunting of the rules, and after all, she always loved roses.",
      "She is right (she is always right): he is never alone.",
      "(See the end of the chapter for notes.)",
      "At first she jokes she left her job because she was tired of explaining that her name was Joan, not Joy; and when that doesn't work, she tries to pretend it's her life's new calling to help new trainers master their Pokemon--better that than trying to explain the crippling guilt of watching a patient fade as its ten-year-old trainer watches in horror.",
      "And then she meets Sherlock, scion of Celadon City's wealthiest family who's left home with his Squirtle to make a name for himself thirty years late; or at least that's what she thinks until, outside Viridian City's deserted gym, he breaks his sulky silence to pull out a lockpick and pronounce: \"Well, here we are.\"",
      "She just looks at him in surprise, and Sherlock huffs out an exasperated breath; \"Don't tell me,\" he demands (and some tiny part of Joan recognizes, even then, that her life will never be the same again), \"you haven't heard of an organization called Team Rocket?\"",
      "For the prompt: Any, any, kids cartoon AU For the prompt: Any, any, kids cartoon AU(Medieval History + Pokemon) Richard is proud of his Emboar, and well should he be; the Lancasters's Pokemon all bear the marks of its claws, and he owes every one of the hard-earned badges pinned to his shirt to Emboar's resilience.",
      "Even Ned's Sunflora, splendid as it is in high noon, takes some effort to challenge it; and the less said of George's Tauros, the better.",
      "But sometimes, between battles and contests, he remembers his Tepig, still small enough in those days for Anne to hold in her arms and absentmindedly caress as she listened to him describe his ambitions for hours, and he feels just the slightest pang of longing.",
      "Bonus unprompted continuation of the last fic, because the plot bunny bit me and I couldn't say no.",
      "He's known what to expect of the Elite Four as long as he can remember, his one goal to defeat them before they destroy his family: there's Edward, who favors Fighting Pokemon, William with his affinity for Ice and Water, Somerset, who's never met a Psychic Pokemon he couldn't twist to dangerous ends, and last but certainly not least, Margaret and her carefully trained team of Dark Pokemon.",
      "This is why it is such a terrible surprise when he steps into the hall of his final challenger before he can be declared Champion, and finds the one woman he never expected to see in this Lancaster-infested building staring back at him.",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" mouths Anne as she fumbles at her belt, or perhaps he only imagines it; either way, it doesn't matter: her Rapidash is free of its Pokeball and furious, racing towards him with its horn pointed at his heart."

    "text": "Prompt: Greek mythology, Perseus & Medusa, pity The snakes of her hair hiss at his approach, yet she remains still, soft somehow in sleep, and as he raises his sword, he feels, absurdly, some kind of guilt running through him like the waves of the ocean. Light flashes from his blade on the downswing, catching her across the face, and her eyes fly open, their reflection meeting his for the smallest space of time. In them is not a monster; merely a woman - and then nothing at all. Prompt: Greek Mythology, Ariadne (/Dionysus), Corona Borealis She sneers when word of Theseus's excuse reaches her ears (overlooked and forgotten indeed!), but Dionysus strokes her face with sadness in his eyes, and leans to whisper in her ear. \"I will never forget.\" Her crown, hanging in a shining bright arc over the world below, is the proof of his words, more immortal than any of them. Prompt: Greek mythology, Iphigenia, I will haunt you like a ghost \"I will follow you,\" she says, spitting defiance in his face even as the wind tears at her hair and clothes, as he draws the blade that will end her life. \"My shade will haunt you all your life, and every victory you win will turn to ash around you, I vow it.\" There is nothing in Agamemnon's eyes as he shoves her to her knees, not hate or rage, not grief, guilt or fear, and she knows then, as the blade slices her throat, swift and sure, that he is dead already, just as much as she. Prompt: Greek Mythology/Aeneid, Cupid & Aeneas, \"Leaving her was a mistake, brother--trust me, I know.\" Lavinia's skin smells ever like smoke, like the smoke he sees still in his dreams, rising in a plume of ash and death on the wind that drove his ships from Dido's shores. He prays to the gods to remove this stain from his soul, so that he might give his heart over to his wife in honesty, and not lay another face over hers in the darkness behind his eyes when they lie together. Sometimes he thinks he can feel his half brother's eyes on him, hear the accusing words, just on the edge of a wind from the south, sighing, Twice I gave you love and you have lost it; why should I spend my arrows for you now? and so he knows if there is love to be built here, he must build it himself, and know it for purely his own. Prompt: Greek Mythology, Hecuba (& Odysseus), vestiges of kindness (bonus: in the version of the fall of Troy where she isn't...turned into a dog somehow, Hecuba is given to Odysseus as a slave, and yet, in the Odyssey, he never mentions her once. What happened there?) She's still dangerous, of course - a woman who was a Queen can never be just a woman again, but is always something more, the crown on her head never quite invisible - and Hecuba is more dangerous than most, by far, for she remains unbroken, and bitter to the bone. Still, he can't help feeling something akin to pity for her, though he knows she'd not thank him for it, would throw it back in his face like so much refuse. So when his captives are brought aboard his ships for the journey home, he unlocks her fetters himself, and looks the other way as she walks (of course she walks; her pride, more than her age, will not allow her to run) away, and tells himself she would be more trouble than he needs on his voyage home in any case; all he wants is peaceful sailing. Prompt: Greek Mythology, Eros/Psyche, And of course I forgive/I've seen how you live/Like a phoenix you rise from the ashes For a time, any lamplight is hateful, nearly as hateful as his mother's soft, triumphant smiles, but this changes the day he hears the flowers speak to him with the voice of his half-sister; from her throne deep below the earth, her voice whispers, foolish boy, you fault your love for betraying trust where none was given? Do you not care to know what has become of her, how she has died and returned for love of you? the voice calls, and he finds, rubbing the scarred patch of skin at his shoulder, that he does want her still, very much. And so he goes to seek her out, and raise the sparks of their love once more. Prompt: Greek Mythology, Creusa and Cassandra, I had a sister lovely in my sight Cassandra watches her sister sometimes and thinks her like a star, steady and quiet but brilliant and beautiful all the same, and pities her, as she pities them all, all those she loves who will fall, one by one; this sister she always sees through a haze of flames and smoke, distant screams and creeping panic. Still, she envies her too, envies Creusa the love she sees as well, the embrace of a husband in the night, the sticky kisses of a child, the sweetness of a life and family all her own; all the things Cassandra will never have, not even for a mere handful of years. \"You deserve better, sister,\" she says, and though Creusa smiles absently and pats her hand, barely hearing what her sister has said, Cassandra still feels absurdly guilty; whether she means Creusa deserves a better sister or a better fate, even she could not say. Prompt: Greek Mythology, Hektor, the price of goodness \"It isn't fair,\" Andromache whispers in the dark, her fingers clutching him tightly enough to pain even him as they lie together sleepless, waiting for the sunrise. \"It should not be you, this should not be your war.\" He holds her closer, this wife he loves so well who was given freely to him, who bore him a beautiful splendid child in this glorious city of his beloved father's that has always held him high above all others, given him love and honors and adulation, and knows, as he has always known, that there must be a price, and someday he must pay. Prompt: Greek Mythology, any, \"sympathy for the devil\" [Cassandra & Agamemnon] She unnerves him, she knows, with her constant staring, even after he threatens her with fists, with knives, with rape. \"Her shade drapes over you like a cloak,\" she says, as the ship sails closer and closer to the shores of Greece, to the wife he left behind, to the crimes he had committed to ease his path to her city, to its destruction. \"Soon you will feel her bite,\" Cassandra whispers; over Agamemnon's shoulder, Iphigenia's shade smiles, and Cassandra shivers, and is sorry still, so sorry, that no one ever hears.",

    "text": "And so it was that brave Heracles, gold-haired son of shapely-ankled Alcmene, came to the rock upon which clever Prometheus, who had inspired the wrath of wise Zeus by matching him in wit before the other divinities of Olympus, was bound. Almighty Zeus, angered by sly Prometheus, had cruelly bound the son of Iapetus and Clymene to the rock with inextricable chains and a large shaft driven straight through the middle of the brilliant Titan and set upon him the mild wood pigeon, which cooed nonsense at the son of Iapetus day and night, not allowing the Titan to scheme any witty plans or think clever thoughts. All were forbidden to approach clever Prometheus by order of wise Zeus, for the Titan was famed for his wits and intelligence, hence his punishment of boredom. All, that is, until Theban-born Heracles, whom Olympian Zeus allowed near in order that he increase his own glory, by slaying the boring wood pigeon and freeing the son of Iapetus. It was through Almighty Zeus' beneficence that valiant Heracles' arrow flew true, striking the threatening wood pigeon in its breast and breaking the divine chains holding dark-haired Prometheus to his rock. Intelligent Prometheus, freed from his punishment, offered Heracles his gratitude. \"What you did, just then, that was...good.\" Sayeth fair-haired Heracles, \"What? Oh, you're welcome.\" \"I see you have come from the East, that you recently visited Illyria, and then consulted The Old Man of the Sea,\" clever Prometheus said to mighty Heracles and, upon the demi-god's look of surprise and awe, explained how he had come to know what Heracles would swear that no one save slippery Nereus himself would know. \"You came to this valley from the West,\" raven-haired Prometheus said, \"and you have sand grains from the coast of Illyria clinging to your fair hair. So much, so obvious. You have burn marks that have yet to heal on your inner arms and scratches from a variety of different animals, all fresh. Yet you're a demi-god, son of Zeus by the look of you, which means that those marks were inflicted by one of the gods. None are so adept at changing their shape as Old Nereus.\" Brave Heracles, who had slew the Nemean Lion with his very own hands, who had captured and ridden the fearsome Cretan Bull, was astonished by quick-witted Prometheus, a being unlike any he'd yet met. \"That's amazing!\" said fair-haired Heracles. The Titan was astounded by these unexpected words, having never expected to hear such gloried praised from the son of Olympian Zeus, spoke in surprise. \"You think so?\" The son of lovely Alcmene swore it was so. \"Yes, of course. It was extraordinary.\" Titan Prometheus, known for his brilliant mind, divined Heracles' task and, feeling generous at the service the mortal had provided him, offered his assistance. \"You head West to the Hesperides, to the garden they tend and the hundred-headed dragon which never sleeps.\" Strong Heracles, astounded, indicated the truth of wise Prometheus's utterance. The clever Titan told mighty Heracles that he should, instead, seek Atlas, the Titan who bore the world upon his shoulders. \"For though he is very strong, he lacks basic intelligence. Have you ever seen his face? It's enough to put off even a marginally intelligent mortal.\" Prometheus, son of Iapetus, eyed stout Heracles for a long moment, noticing--as many others before have done--the perfection of his form. \"It would be the work of a moment for you to convince idiotic Atlas to retrieve the apples for you, for that is your task, is it not?\" Heracles, the Theban-born son of Zeus, answered affirmatively and thanked the clever Titan for his advice and made to continue westward, across the sea and towards the place where the blue-domed Heavens were held apart from vast Gaia. But quick-thinking Prometheus, before valient Heracles could depart the valley for the West, spoke to him. \"Oh, but wise Nereus sent you upon this path for yet another reason, for only a decade ago I told him I must be a difficult god to find a flatmate for.\" And that is how, once glorious Heracles had finished his labour, he sought out the raven-haired Titan with the blessing of his almighty father, the Thundershaker, but that is a story for another time.",

    "text": "\"Well,\" Pandora drawls as she takes in his prone form, bloody and chained and naked (nothing she hasn't seen before), \"This is underwhelming\". \"You don't say,\" Prometheus bites out through the gritted teeth, and she shoos the birds away. Pain makes him surly, and he is difficult to deal with as it is, always has been, always will be. Part of her relishes the power his punishment has given her - to bring relief or to withhold it - and she wields it with the cruel precision she's never deemed she has before. Perhaps, Prometheus did. He never thanks her, after all. Ungrateful son of a bitch. Still. His eyebrows unknit and the tortured frown marring his savage face slackens. Pandora moves to dab off the sweat of his forehead, but Prometheus twists away from her touch. As far as his chains allow, that is. \"What do you want?\" he snaps at her, ever the cross one, and Pandora sighs, yet doesn't lower her outstretched hand, doesn't step away. \"Geez,\"she says, \"Looking good, Pandora. So nice of you to visit. How have you been? I am fine, Prometheus. Thanks for asking!\" Prometheus scoffs, but lets her sidle closer, lets her swipe her fingers over the damp skin. She doesn't miss the way he leans into her palm, knows enough not to comment on it. Her husband is a proud man (well, a titan), and even now, stripped off of all his privileges, all his dignity, even of his death, he remains the same. Exposing his weakness, no matter how small, would get her nowhere, and whatever he may think, she doesn't come here to fight. \"You know\", she offers conversationally, smoothing his dark hair, hard as wires they are and prickly, \"Small talk can get you a long way. I might even be cajoled to bring you biscuits next time\". He rolls his eyes, clearly annoyed now, and Pandora smiles. She delights in his annoyance for annoyance is not pain, and the fact that he can still feel something, something other than the perpetual agony he is cursed with, is encouraging. \"Like I would take anything from you,\" he says. The blow, though not unexpected, manages to dampen her mood and is that spit on her dress? \"No,\" she replies, a bit more vehemently than she intended, \"Of course, not. And I wouldn't give them to you anyway. Even if you begged\". Not that he would. Prometheus doesn't know how to beg, doesn't know how to ask or plead or compromise. With him there is only freedom and choice and the right to know. All things noble, all things righteous and selfless and good. It makes her wonder why he married her in the first place, the lying treacherous snake that she is.You didn't need me, she wants to tell him, still don't, so why did you? Why me, the all-gifted, the all-giving, why marry me if you don't want any of my gifts? \"They are fine,\" she says, \"Your pets. A bit miffed after the second world war, but fine. They'll get over it\".Prometheus' brow creases. \"War?\"Yes, yes, one of the wicked things that climbed out from the box, one of the real nasties. \"Russians won, by the way. They got lucky. The winter was truly vicious. Lost more than a half of their own army though, but don't look a gift horse in the mouth, right?\"He is angry now, she can tell, and anger is even better than annoyance, so Pandora is pleased. Her smile widens, and Pandora practically beams at him.Hate me, she wills him, hate me even though I've never opened the damned box. Epimetheus did, but he is your brother and you love him and you've never loved me, so hate me, let me have this much at least. I'll be the betrayer, the wicked one, the cursed one. I'll be Eve and Lilith and the snake. I'll let them tarnish my name, I'll let them curse the half of the human race that you crafted in my likeness because when all was said and done, I looked into the box and there was nothing, no hope for us, no hope at all, and it means that this will never end. Pandora stays with him until he falls asleep. Eagles won't return as long as she is here.",

    "text": "You find her in the forest, lying unconsciously next to a burned out fireplace. The wind pulls at your hair; the coldness stings your fingers. She's wrapped in moist tatters and her hair matches the color of the autumn leaves beneath her. You set aside your basket with a handful of mushrooms, and kneel down beside her. Her face is turned away from you and her hands are balled to fists. Her skin looks dry and her figure is thin. You try to estimate how long she must have been lying here: Days, probably. You reach out and curiously brush away some strands of hair from a grey cheek. She's rough beneath your fingertips--her hair sticks to her skin. You feel her scars before you see them: black stitches cover her eyes in thick ropes; patches of skin have been recklessly sewed together. It's careless work; the wounds make her face look like a puzzle. She's beautiful. You hold your palm to her dry lips and sigh in relief when you feel her breath. It's shallow but it's there: Life. Carefully you pick her up. She's as light as a feather. And she smells like tree bark and like soil. You press her to your chest--wrap your cloak around her. She soaks up your body heat and even your heart starts shivering. But it's been centuries since you last touched another human, so maybe that's what it's supposed to feel like. Her body sinks into your mattress--drowns in soft sheets--and you flinch before you realize: She hasn't turned to stone. She's icy when you peel off her ragged clothes. Her body is full of scars, too--not the same thick ropes that adorn her face; they're thin lines on her back and arms and shoulders. There are larger ones, too, which you recognize as old punishments. They resemble yours. You soak a sponge in warm water and dab away dirt and dried blood and scurf until her body is soft again. When you pry open her hands there is one crescent scar in each palm. Those two look fresh and like they could hurt, so you leave them alone. There's no reaction still when you dab some water on her lips with the tips of your fingers. You wrap her in a fresh nightgown and your thickest blankets, which you pull up to her chin as you sit by the bed. The sun is setting. You're used to hiding yourself away in darkness and she's blind and unconscious, but you light a candle nonetheless. Maybe it'll force away her nightmares. Maybe the light will guide her back to reality.. You stay up and watch her sleep. And sleeping it has become now, because her breath is stronger and even, like her heart beat when you press your ear against her chest. Sometimes her fingers twitch as if she was trying to reach for something, but you never reach back, because whatever she's searching for she won't find it in you. Every hour you dab at her lips, and you wash her face and her palms again in the morning. You treat her wounds, too, with oil that you made from Wild Rose. And the next night you light another candle: a little flame to connect you through the darkness. You sing to her--melodies that you thought forgotten; lullabies that your mother sang to you when you were a child. Those are words from a time that you barely remember; a time before your life was taken from you. Now you exist by yourself, far away from all the kingdoms that have banished you--far away from men and beasts who could inflict more damage. You have disappeared to the human eye and you don't possess a mirror, either. Sometimes she cracks open her mouth. Then you dampen her lips and wait. You smile the first time she licks away the water. The third day you come back from collecting herbs and find her tossing and turning. Her forehead burns when you press your palm to it. You clean her face and her wrists and her neck. She calms down and sighs at the cool of the damp cloth you wrap around her calves. Her voice sounds like the wind when it makes thick brushwood whisper. You stay with her the rest of the day; you wipe away sweat and change her clothes again. This time when she reaches out you take her hand. She squeezes tight.. The fourth day she wakes up. You crack open the door and her voice sounds through the room like the rustling of leaves: \"I knew you'd come. \"I've seen you in my visions from the day I was captured and brought to war; I've seen you helping me. In all the possible universes, in everything that could be--you were always there: the most beautiful creature to walk upon earth.\" Disappointment clutches your heart. The hand she's been reaching out has deceived you. It's never been you--of course it hasn't! In ancient times this could have been you: beautiful--it's what they called you. But the years have worn you out and the day you were cursed to live in solitude lies lifetimes in the past. Long have your children grown old, and their children have, too. The last thought of happiness was such a long time ago that it may as well not be true. The Gods rained spite upon you, and they took advantage of your humanity. They took your beauty and they turned it against you: They took your body and they made it theirs. They used you up and spat you out. When you didn't serve their entertainment any longer, they told you no one could ever see you again. They told you to hide your body away in the shadows or Poseidon would seek you out again. He'd punish you for your vanity like he did in Athena's temple. Now that you've fulfilled their purpose you're of no use to anyone. You're hideous, not beautiful, not like Athena--that lesson you learned. And you're not nearly as beautiful as the marvelous woman sitting before you now: with tousled crimson locks falling over her shoulders, chappy lips and slender fingers reaching out again, reaching out to what can't be you. But she says: \"I've seen you time and time again. You saved me.\" You back away into the kitchen without saying anything. There's a feeling squeezing your insides; it's so old that it almost feels new. It's something you thought long lost. It's something you didn't even remember you were capable of feeling. And there's no word in your vocabulary anymore to describe it properly. But it lies heavy in your guts and it drowns out all sound. It makes your head spin, too. You want to cry but the tears won't come. Your throat is tight and sore. And yet this other feeling--new and old, forgotten and there--lingers. It makes you want to breathe, and you inhale deeply before letting go off the edge of the counter. You didn't even realize how your death grip was turning your knuckles white. The soup you make consists mostly of hot water and some herbs to sooth a sore stomach. She cradles the bowl with both hands when you sit at the edge of the bed. Her insides growl when she takes a first careful sip: her body is rebuking her. She recovers quickly, though, and greedily empties the bowl, before thanking you. \"I don't have anything to give you in return.\" Again you marvel at her voice--distant and so close to you at the same time. Her words blow right through your skin; they settle somewhere deep below flesh and muscle. You raise your palm to your lips when your breath hitches. And you swallow anything you meant to say. You were born into a family of Gods and you grew up among them. They treated you dearly until they did not. They praised you until you grew confident. You've seen the Moon and the Sun and the Stars above the forests--you can call them all by their names--their real names, not the ones that people gave them. Those Gods were your parents and your siblings. They were the ones to raise you and to kick you down. They taught you how to be a human: a worthless toy in the hands of the Divine. But you've never looked upon a face and felt so humbled. Her hands are rough and warm when she takes yours, and you fight your instincts to dodge the touch. \"I don't see much anymore,\" she says. \"My visions are all blurry now.\" She smiles. Then she leans back into the pillow, and your palms are cold when she lets go. Olympus has long been abandoned, ever since people started worshipping different gods. You wonder which of these new realms she might have fallen from--or if she simply fell from grace. People all call themselves good. Her words \"Could I have some water, please?\" pull you from your thoughts. You start and are back with a cup within seconds. Another few seconds later the cup is empty and she's asleep. Centuries ago you would have demanded a price at face value for your generosity. Now the value of your face is nothing, and nothing is the amount of what you need, from her or anyone. You stay by her side until dusk has turned to darkness and the Grey who is strongest in the world between day and night is no longer a threat. She breathes evenly now. Her face is cool when you press your palm to it. Her skin has regained its color. Maybe you were wrong. Maybe this is what it's supposed to feel like. And maybe there is something you need after all. You keep a cup of fresh water on the nightstand and find it empty in the morning. Just like the bed. You change the sheets and listen to the silence around you. She's gone, and she has taken the chirping of the birds and the slithering of the snakes and the rustling of the leaves with her. It's the quietness that only a person can leave behind--the silence only words can cause.. The days are longer now even though winter is coming and the hours of daylight are fewer. You stay awake at night and listen to your heart beat or the blood rushing through the veins in your temples. And you keep a cup of water by the bed, just in case. Just in case you become thirsty. Sometimes you think you hear her voice, but it's always only the wind whistling through the crack in the door or making brushwood whisper when you're out gathering herbs. Whenever a sound seems more than that you never hear it again. Sometimes you think a breeze carries her scent, but it's always an illusion. You search the ground for leaves with the right color, but they're all damp now and rotting away. There's nothing left of crimson--time's not patient with you. You open the door to your home and find the bed empty every day. Until you think you've only dreamed her, like one dreams an oasis in the desert, like a starving woman dreams of apples. You're thankful for the delusional moments when you sit by a well and remember washing her face. The years have worn you out, but they have also made you richer. You have nothing, and yet you have your memories. In your mind you map her scars with the tip of your index finger. She tells you where she got them and you sing to her again. You go back to where you found her, and you sit by the burned out fireplace and wait. You imagine her sitting next to you, stretching her hands into your direction once more. You close your eyes and feel her warmth. And maybe that's what it's supposed to feel like. Life moves on and drags you along through rain and storm until the very last leaf has fallen. You don't mourn her loss, because you never really had her. And that's not what this is about anyway now, is it?. She's back with the year's first snowflakes melting in her hair. \"I'm blind,\" she says. There's finality in her statement. Her smile is faint but unmistakably there. Your eyes trace every inch of her. She looks exactly like you remember: every stitch as thick as the needle that put it there, every scar intact. She's wearing a long earth-colored dress. Her hands are red, and cold as ice when you take them into yours. She seems as light as a feather. Maybe the wind carried her back to you. You can't help the smile twitching at the corners of your mouth when you lead her in. You fire up the oven, and she warms you with her words: \"From now on everything is new. All I ever knew is gone--all of what could be, all of what will be. The only thing I remember is you--the only one who ever helped me; the only person I want to know. I don't need anything else.\" When you finally let go of her, she reaches out again. Foolishly you lower your head to hide the blush. Her smile is as warm as her words and her hands now. You eat, together in silence. It's the silence that's full of life and comfort. It's the kind of silence which leaves create once they stop falling--the calm after a storm. Outside snow's falling and it makes you think of the noise in your heart. \"Lies,\" she says when she puts down her spoon. \"They've told you so many lies.\" She doesn't explain and she doesn't have to, either. You swallow your tears but they're relentless like the winter. Her heart is pounding strong and steady when she presses your cheek against her chest. \"They told you all these lies so you wouldn't tell the truth. But I swear to you that in all realities I've seen you're beautiful, especially now.\" Her lips taste like water fresh from the spring. And her hands on your waist hold you close to her. Her back arches beneath your fingertips, and your cheeks burn hot when you part before diving back in. You're as light as a feather.",

    "text": "He weren't paying all those cluckers no account. Preacher talking to Dicy's mama about how she better off in heaven than with a walking musician like Bobby, playing his Devil's music. Dicy's sisters talking about how her love of snakebite whiskey took her down. Her friends talking about how if only she hadn't insisted on heading out every night to hear him at whatever tar-paper, tin-roof shack that would let him play. If only she hadn't taken an opened bottle from a stranger. Dicy's mama's mouth all a tumbling with words bout how Dicy were in a better place now. His baby's bones in the ground and all her people could talk about was how she better off dead than in his arms. No. He weren't paying a single copper on the ground for what they had to say. He wipe the tears from his face. He tune Lucille. He wait round in the graveyard until it got good and dark. He walk his self through that graveyard to the crossroads on the far side. He dig a little hole like he'd heard he supposed to. He put her nation sack into the ground. It only got one nickel in it. He whisper, \"Papa Legba, this is all I got, so I hope it's enough.\" He put the dirt over it and stood his aching back up. He were expecting an old man with a cane. Some old fella with a wide brimmed hat. Papa Legba come alright, but he ain't old. He got horns like a bull. All black and tipped in white at the end. He's also bare assed naked and sporting the biggest damn cock Bobby's ever seen. He's about to protest that he won't. That he don't swing that way, but for Dicy, he's already come to the crossroads. That ain't nothing but a little tickle. Papa Legba laugh from his belly and his cock bounce to the rhythm. \"Relax fella. I only swing in the direction the door is hung.\" He circle round Bobby. \"Although, you got some mighty fine wood on you.\" He squeeze Bobby's ass. Bobby try not to cry out. Papa Legba laugh and it were the kinda laugh that put the jump on a July morning. \"Now that you've brought me all the way out here,\" he rest his head on Bobby's shoulder. He all kinds of pressed up against Bobby, but Bobby don't flinch away. \"What is it that you are looking for?\" Bobby pick up Lucille. He play, \"Baby Done Left Me Going Down.\" He go through a full deck of chucka-chucka rhythm. Lucille wail his heart. He sing with her. When the last chord die, Papa Legba give him a hug. He were the old man now that Bobby had expected. \"Oh, that's a world of blues you got there.\" He slide his hand down Lucille's neck and it were all Bobby could do not to bat that hand away. \"You done made perfect what I created.\" He wink at Bobby. \"Not an easy thing to do.\" He laugh and this time it were the sound of high cotton in summer. \"You sure you want this, boy?\" Bobby say, \"Yes, sir. This is what I've got to do.\" \"Okay, then. Follow me.\" Papa Legba whistle and pat his leg. An old, liver speckled coon hound bound to his side. He set off a walking down that dark road. Bobby follow him down through the tunnel of willow trees. Their long branches brush along his face like fingers trying to hold him from doing what he had to do. He push them aside like so many busy bodies. They came on down to a wide river flowing lazy in the moonlight. A ricketty dock sticks out into the molasses dark water. Papa Legba touch his hat to Bobby. \"Hope it works out, son.\" He whistle for his hound and off he go off into the night. Bobby don't have long to wait. Agwe on a conch shell row on up. He put up his brightly colored oars and tap them against the shell. Bobby dip his handkerchief in the water and offer it to Agwe, who sniff at the offering. \"Should be as I won't take you for such a paltry ass sacrifice.\" Bobby get in the shell and tune Lucille up. He play, \"Come on in My Kitchen\" and no wall to corner load against, the sound go out over the water and were fair eat up by the river. Agwe pick up his oars. \"Now you shoulda just started with that and not wasted my damn time with a damn kerchief.\" He set to rowing. He even offer Bobby a little champagne from the bottle that he got cooling out in the water. Bobby drink a little. Weren't polite to refuse. He play a few more songs until the water was rocking with the sound. When they reached the far side, Agwe give Bobby the bottle. \"Sure you don't want to stick around. Ain't meant for the living where you're going?\" \"No, but thank you.\" Bobby take the bottle to be polite and he set off down the road on the far side. The willow trees brush their long branches across his face and snag on Lucille like a whole load of busy bodies trying to keep him from what he got to do. He hold Lucille tight against his self and keep on his way. Road open up to a small clearing and up he comes to a tar-paper shack with a roof made from flattened soup cans. There's a big old hound with three heads glaring with all six eyes at him from the porch. Its growl is enough to curl the hairs on the head of Bobby's great, great, great grandmama. Bobby ain't going to let it keep him back though. He play something he heard in a fancy concert hall up North. It's the dance of the Blessed Spirits and he hopes it blesses him. That pooch gets to slobbering and swaying. It rest all three of heads on the porch and even let Bobby scratch its belly. Bobby go into the shack. Place is crowded with dead folk just like a cow's thick with flies. Someone as died a hundred year or more is up on a stage with a drum. That fella, he sing the old, old songs. They serve moonshine whiskey in three different colors and rum that smell like dark water molasses. Bobby has himself a glass for courage and asked if anyone there abouts know a Dicy. She find him first. She look all kinds of washed out. \"Bobby, what you doing here? You can't be here.\" \"I've come to bring you back.\" Bobby try to take her hand, but Dicy pull away from him. Always a stubborn woman. She look over his shoulder at someone behind him. \"Bobby, I'm dead. I died with snakebite whiskey in my mouth. There ain't no coming back from that.\" Bobby look to see where she was looking. Baron Samedi sit calm as you please at a table off to the side. His top hat made of real silk and he got his colored glasses on with one eye poked out. He ain't looking at Bobby though. He watch this high yellow girl with her hair cut short and crinkled from an iron. She tracing shapes with a glass of rum on the table. She look so bored that boredom got a new name. Bobby look at her. She all straight lines and not a single curve to her. Bobby think to his self, \"She's the new.\" She the new music. She the new steps. The new everything. She just new. So, new, Bobby don't even know her name and he know all the names. Dicy laugh. \"Bobby, you can't even keep your eyes straight when you're rescuing me from the dead.\" Bobby glare at her. \"Woman, you've got to stop suspecting me of walking out on you. I'm just getting me an idea.\" Dicy put her hands on her beautiful round hips. \"You mean an idea like coming down into the realm of the dead.\" Bobby take a quick squeeze of that soft round behind and she don't half but bat his hand, but hold it there. \"An idea.\" He walk up onto the stage and he give the singer there a glass of whiskey. He take down Lucille and he say, \"I'm thinking we need to pitch a little boogie woogie.\" Bobby play. He don't play the Blues. Chicago, Saint Louie, Delta or otherwise. The New don't want to listen to the Blues. The New want to listen to swing like they play up in Harlem. The New look up. She laugh and her laugh were the sound of dawn on a spring morning. She take Baron Samedi by the hand and pull him out onto the sawdust floor and dance. When the song's over, the New don't look tired, so Bobby start up with another song. He play, \"Oh! Red.\" He play, \"Let's Get Drunk And Truck\". He play \"We Gonna Pitch A Boogie Woogie\". He play until even the New look tired. Then Lucille still humming, he play \"Terraplane Blues\" nice and slow. Baron Samedi pull the New close, but he watch Bobby over the New's shoulder. The New watch him too. After Bobby let the last chord die. He put Lucille down. He has himself a long drink of rum, sweet as molasses. Baron Samedi and the New come over. She talk first. \"Why I don't know if I've ever heard anyone play quite like that.\" She lick her lips and run her hand up Baron Samedi's arm. \"Ah, honey, let's keep him.\" Baron Samedi laugh and his laugh puts the frost out in a January morning. \"No, honey. I think our friend here must be going.\" Baron Samedi look at Bobby out over his glasses. \"But on account of you giving us such a good time,\" He reached into his coat and pulled out two golden tickets that gleam in the dim light. He hold them out and then pull them back. \"But you take these, you ain't coming back.\" He grin like a dead man will. \"And one more thing. You look back once, the eyes in your fool head leave the road, then you come up snake eyes. Understand?\" \"I understand.\" Bobby take the tickets so fast that they smoke with his taking them up. He saunter out the front door, but what he find outside weren't what he'd found when he'd come there. What he see was a road all silvered with broken bottles. A walking man, he walk on the glass and he think he can hear Dicy following behind. \"Dicy. You there?\" She say a whole lot of nothing. \"Dicy, don't be like that.\" He plead, but she don't talk. The glass crunch under his feet. He look down and he make out the words on the bottles. Snakebite whiskey this was. There was still sips in cracked pieces. He start to strum on Lucille. He noddle. He try. Damn but he try. He keep hearing the crackle of them damned bottles under his feet. He don't hear Dicy. He plead with Dicy, \"Just one little word, honey. Just let me know that you ain't taking another drink of that snakebite whiskey.\" But she stubborn. She don't say nothing. Finally, he just can't stand it. He just going to take a quick look. But there he is, holding one golden ticket. The other ticket so much Mississippi mud. Dicy, has to have one last word. \"Bobby, you can't even keep your eyes straight when you're rescuing me from the dead.\" Then she ain't nowhere. All he see were the road he's gone by and it's just so much crushed glass. All he see were Papa Legba looking at him with a wide grin plastered all over his face. \"Sure screwed the pooch on that one.\" Papa Legba's liver colored hound pant against his leg. Bobby ain't rightly sure what to say to that. He hand Papa Legba his golden ticket. He sling Lucille off his shoulder and he play the Blues. They walk down the road like that. Bottles underfoot. Walking from the crossroads. Playing the sweet Delta Blues. Length: 7.23Mb, 17:51 Download podfic Archived here",

    "text": "The first time he puts his hands on me, I see her. Just for a flash, a second long scene. She stands over him, a sword in her hand. I taste the metallic tang of blood in my mouth, just for a moment. Since the sack of Troy I have drifted through days, a victim of a catastrophe too vast to stop. I tried to warn my people, but my words were not heeded, my visions not believed. All the death and violence came crashing over us in a flood that could not be halted. Since that night I have wandered like a ghost in the Greek camp, a shade in the body of a girl. My skin is cold and clammy to the touch. The men put their hands on me and I feel nothing, my mind drifting loose, like oil upon the surface of water. And then Agamemnon, leader of the Greeks, claims me for his captive. As his hands come down on my shoulders I see this, this image of his doom. For the first time in many days I feel something leap inside of me. I see the conqueror of my city brought low by his own wife. I laugh aloud. He looks at me, incredulous, perhaps wondering if I am really as mad as they say, but my laughter does not stop him. I do not laugh again. Later, when he leaves to confer with the other Greek leaders, I turn the vision over in my mind. The fierce joy flares in me again, and I am glad to know Agamemnon will not go unpunished. She must be a singular woman, his queen. The first few days I longed to join my father in death, but this vision, this woman, causes hope to kindle within me. I will see him dead. We sail across the Aegean, lashed by winds and terrible storms. When we pass by the coastline of his country, a beacon flares into life. His ships sail into the harbour, and he leaves his soldiers camped down in the city. The sun is sinking below the horizon, staining the sky crimson and gold. He takes me in his chariot, and we mount the hill to his palace. As we reach the top I see another beacon burning. Our arrival is expected. We approach the palace. In the gathering dark I see her standing there. Clytaemnestra. She is a single figure, lit by two lines of torches. Her arms are bare, encircled by bands of gold. Her skin is golden too, thick muscles beneath its surface. Around her neck a torque of gold glistens. Gold stitching upon her dress outlines the powerful lines of her body. The torches burn bright in the darkness, and she blazes too. They outline a path up to the palace steps where she is standing. The light shines upon her jewellery, on her skin, and she seems to shimmer before us like one of my visions. As the chariot stops beside the path of torches she steps to the left and claps her hands. The palace doors are thrown open behind her. Servants come out, bearing a long red tapestry. They unroll it, throwing it down the steps. It unfurls dark as blood, a red tide flowing out between the lines of torches. I gasp. In my mind I see the steps of the palace in Troy flow with blood, real blood, liquid and sticky. It smelled of rot and the grave and the sea. Clytaemnestra strides forward, beside the tapestry, not upon it. Her long tawny hair falls wild and loose down her back, like the mane of a lion. I have never seen a lion in the wild, but my father had one brought to the palace once. It prowled in its cage, movements constrained by the bars. She reminds me of its captive grace, and the sense I had that were the bars removed it would explode into violence. She comes to stand before us, at the foot of the pathway she has created. Agamemnon steps down from the chariot and she smiles, showing her teeth. They speak, and at her urging he strides forward upon the tapestries, his feet treading upon the thick red path. In my memory, he and his men stalk forward as Troy burns, their sandals soaking up blood. He goes through the doors alone, and Clytaemnestra turns to me. 'Come princess, there is no need to remain in the chariot. Come into the palace, my women will see you bathed and dressed.' Her smile does not touch her eyes. I say nothing, thinking of the lion again, and her teeth. She raises her eyebrows. 'My husband is very taken with you, little bird. Perhaps he is in love. You do not have to speak to me, if you do not wish, but come inside.' I find my voice. 'Why do you call me that?' She laughs. 'You are so dark and still, you make me think of the nightingales in my gardens at dusk. And I have heard tales of your visions, your songs.' I do not speak again, but allow her women to lead me from the chariot and into the palace. I do not trust her kind words. She spoke as sweetly to her husband, and I know the malice which must fester in her heart toward him. There are low fires lit within the whole palace, so that the marble floors shine with light, and flickering shadows crowd in the corners. I am led to a bath chamber, a bronze tub brimming with water, rose petals floating on its surface. Steam clouds the air. The servants take my clothes and do not return them. I sink into the water and let out a sigh. It is soothing upon my skin, which seems to soften beneath its surface. I smell sweet now, like flower sap. I look up and find Clytaemnestra standing there, watching me. I cannot read her expression. Her brow furrows. 'How came you by that?' she asks, indicating a bruise the size of a palm upon my breast. I look down, and remember. I speak without thinking. 'That, that is the love token your husband left upon me.' I am surprised by the venom in my voice. So, it seems, is she. Her lips part, as if she would speak, but a servant comes in. 'Milady, the King wishes her brought to him.' Clytaemnestra nods. 'Of course.' I am given a white dress to wear. It is cool upon my skin, still hot from the bath. We walk through the palace. Water clings to my hair, weighing it down. The girl takes me to a bedroom, and then leaves. He is standing there waiting, and smiles to see me. My pulse flutters beneath my breast. I thought I had forgotten how to feel, my emotions dying with my father at Troy, but being in this house has awoken them again. He walks toward me and I feel a sick dread. Maybe I am not the dead girl I thought. The naked want in his eyes is obscene. He props his sword against the bed and comes closer, close enough that I can see the individual hairs in his finely trimmed beard, like little spikes. Do not touch me, I think. I do not want your hands on me again. I do not, cannot, speak, but let him manoeuvre me, backing me toward the bed. His teeth shine in the torchlight as he smiles. My newly awoken fear has aroused him. I feel nausea swoop in my stomach and find myself longing for the numbness I had felt in my shock. He looks at me and sees my city burning. I am a trophy to him, a marker of his victory. I think again of Clytaemnestra. She will avenge my city and me, whether she knows it or not. It is as if this summons her. I look over his shoulder and see her behind, stalking forward on quiet feet, her sword raised. My eyes meet hers for a second. She raises an eyebrow. I look back at him, seeking to keep his attention fixed on me. She moves closer. 'Agamemnon,' she says, her voice low. 'This is for our daughter.' He turns at her voice, his hand going to his hip as he registers her words, but of course his sword is not there. Her blade plunges into his stomach and out, dark blood spurting forth, spattering her dress. Her smile is so wide it is a grimace, a snarl. He falls sideways onto the floor, crying out wordlessly in pain and surprise. His head hits the ground but he is still moving. One hand goes to his waist, coming up red. The other gropes behind him, reaching for his sword. I am faster. I snatch it up and unsheathe it, the scabbard clattering on the floor. 'This is for my people,' I say, and I stab down into his flesh, a hand span higher than the wound she has given him. It goes in deep. I am stronger than I thought. He coughs, red foam gathering on his lips. I leave the sword in him and step back, looking down. Impaled, helpless, he shudders and jerks, pinned by his own sword. He tries to speak, but only spits blood onto the floor. She kneels beside him, gripping his head with her hand. 'For Iphigenia,' she says, her lips near his, and she presses her sword down and across, slitting his throat. His lifeblood gushes forth, splashing into her smiling mouth, streaking her skin, dark flecks landing on her like red petals. She stands and looks at me. 'So,' she says. 'Why did you help me?' If I thought my heart beat fast before, it is nothing to now. It throbs in my temples, my throat, hummingbird fast. I meet her eyes. She is still smiling, fierce and wide. Awed, I incline my head toward her. Blood drips from her sword onto the floor, joining the spreading pool there. She stands like a statue, terrible and still. I look up at her again, unable to keep my eyes from her. 'You are not the only one he has hurt,' I say. 'I did not do this for you,' she says after a pause. I laugh. 'No, and yet it is done nonetheless. We gave him a quicker death than he deserved.' 'Is that so, little nightingale?' she says. The blood, his blood, still glistens upon her lips in the torchlight. She steps around him, closer to me. 'You are even more vicious than I thought.' 'Maybe so. Will you kill me as well?' I ask, raising my chin. I know the answer, but I want to hear her say it, to make her admit it. I can almost taste the blood in my mouth. 'No,' she says quietly, very close to me now. 'You helped me,' she says. 'I will not forget.' I can see her chest rise and fall in her excitement, a vein throbbing in her throat. I cannot help myself; I reach out for her, and kiss her. The sword is still in her hand, but the other comes up, stroking my wet hair. I fall against her, clinging to her. She tastes of the death she has wrought, salt blood upon her lips. She drops the sword, but I do not hear it hit the floor, a roaring in my ears. We fall back upon the bed. Her weight presses me down, her touch upon my skin blotting out everything. I feel more than I have in days, a tide of sensation, my pulse beating like drums inside of me. I am giddy with triumph. I kiss the trail of blood from her neck, her throat, her cheek. It is like ambrosia upon my lips, the taste of victory and vengeance.",

    "text": "\"Sherlock, why is there a rainbow in our living room?\" John was used to quite a lot from living with Sherlock, but this was just ridiculous. \"Tell her to go away!\" Er, okay. That didn't really make any sense at all. John opened the door to Sherlock's bedroom - what was Sherlock doing in his bedroom, anyway? It wasn't as if he slept much. \"And how, exactly, am I supposed to ask a rainbow to go away?\" \"Very politely,\" came a voice from right behind him. \"She doesn't like being bossed around by mortals.\" John spun around, and was faced with a beautiful woman. Or rainbow. Or quite possibly an angel. She did have wings, after all. But were angels supposed to look like rainbows? \"What?\" \"Iris,\" said Sherlock with his most charming, and fake, smile. \"Why are you here?\" \"Your father is not very pleased with you, Ares,\" the rainbow answered. \"My father has never been pleased with me,\" Sherlock answered nonchalantly. \"He said so in the Iliad. It's hardly news.\" The rainbow smiled. John had never seen a rainbow smile before, and he thought it looked scary. But then, he had never seen a rainbow that looked like a woman before either - or was that a woman who looked like a rainbow? \"Zeus gave me a message for you, and you alone.\" \"I'll just be off, then,\" John said, and made himself a cup of tea in the kitchen. He rather thought he needed it. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) A cup of tea was not enough. Something really strange had just happened, John gathered as much. He was, however, not sure about what. But Sherlock had mentioned the Iliad. And the rainbow - Iris? - had called Sherlock Ares. And talked about Zeus. John reluctantly opened his laptop. Some research seemed to be necessary. When John's phone rang ten minutes later, he was even more confused than before. \"Reading about Greek mythology, Doctor Watson? What a fascinating subject.\" John couldn't really bring himself to be surprised by the fact that Mycroft apparently knew all about his internet activity. \"Good afternoon to you too, Mycroft.\" \"I suppose you have learnt about my brother's... identity,\" said Mycroft. \"I do hope you won't leave him because of it. It's hardly his fault, you know.\" \"Can't choose your parents,\" John agreed, deciding that this was not the time to obsess over the fact that he and Sherlock were nothing but friends and flatmates, thank you very much. \"Wait - if he's Ares, and you are his brother - who exactly are you?\" \"I did warn you, you know,\" said Mycroft, completely ignoring John's question. \"When you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield. Hard not to, when you have the god of war for a companion.\" \"Right,\" said John before he realised that Mycroft was no longer on the phone. \"Right.\" Mycrofts real identity may come up in a later work. Sherlock was obviously in a foul mood when he entered the living room a short while later. John looked up from his computer, uncertain how to broach the subject. \"Where did the rainbow go?\" \"Iris,\" said Sherlock, as if that was an answer. \"Do you believe her? She actually warned me about you. She told me I was indiscreet, sharing a flat with you. Me! Indiscreet! And she was the one who came here, with wings and all -\" \"Rainbowy?\" \"Yes!\" \"Is that a problem?\" John asked carefully. Mycroft's phone call hadn't helped much - he still had no idea how these things worked. \"Am I in trouble? Should I try to - I don't know - avoid thunderstorms in the future, or something?\" \"It is generally wise to avoid thunderstorms,\" Sherlock answered cryptically. \"But you are not in trouble, no.\" \"Good,\" said John, and released a breath he wasn't aware of holding. \"That's good. And - are you in trouble?\" \"Not any more than usual.\" \"That is a yes, then.\" Sherlock very firmly did not roll his eyes. \"So you are the god of war,\" John said when it became obvious that Sherlock was not going to volunteer any more information. \"The Greek god of war, yes,\" Sherlock answered. \"I'm hardly the only god of war.\" \"Right.\" He had to get back to that, but this was way too much to process already. \"And your name is Ares.\" \"Call me Sherlock.\" \"Right. And your father is Zeus.\" \"Yes.\" John closed his eyes. He was beginning to get a headache. \"This is insane.\" \"Not insane. Merely a paradigm shift.\" John thought about it for a second before shaking his head. \"Nope. Still insane.\" Sherlock smiled at him. \"Maybe a little bit.\" \"You are the god of war,\" John said finally. \"I just - I'm not sure whether or not that's a good thing. I've been to war, you know.\" Sherlock looked rather amused. \"I know.\" \"Yes. Yes. Of course you do.\" John didn't know how to say what he wanted to say without offending Sherlock. Offending gods was a bit not good, wasn't it? \"War is not pretty.\" \"But you love war.\" \"I don't -\" John stopped himself. No use getting worked up. And yes, he did love feeling useful and making a difference. That was not the important thing right now. \"War is tragic and horrible. Innocent people suffer. People die.\" \"Yes,\" Sherlock agreed. \"And you might not like that part of it. But you love the part where the not-so-innocent people suffer. And you practically live for the part where people don't die. I'm not all about death and suffering, you know.\" \"You're not?\" John swallowed. \"Right. I should have known that.\" \"How much do you really know about greek gods, John?\" \"That you live on Mount Olympus? Only that - you obviously don't.\" \"Very good, John. Excellent deduction.\" \"I have read your article on wikipedia.\" \"Anything interesting?\" \"You have a whole bunch of children. With an impressive list of different goddesses.\" John scrolled down the screen. \"I do, don't I?\" \"Even Aphrodite!\" \"Yes. What wikipedia doesn't know, however, is that I also have a history with most of the male gods.\" John looked up from the computer. \"Right.\" \"Certainly you have learned that I am not very popular amongst the other Olympians.\" \"I might have read something to that account, yes. Shocking, really.\" \"Quite.\" \"But you're telling me that those two are related, right? That the reason the other gods don't like you is not because you cause war and violence, but because - because they are your spurned lovers, or something?\" \"I have been told I can be irresistible.\" Sherlock moved in front of John. John tried to laugh, but it sounded rather forced. \"Yes. I - I can see that.\" \"I am the father of Eros, you know.\" And that should have been a cheesy line, it really should, but apparently it wasn't when a god said it. John closed the laptop. \"Right.\" \"And you do love war.\"",

    "text": "The sun seemed to move slowly in that place. As dusk drifted toward evening, and the shadows grew ever longer, Psyche wandered amongst the colonnades of the golden, shimmering palace she had been brought to live in. Cool grass grew underfoot, clusters of small ferns at the bases of the tall columns, and lilies of the valley filled the air with their fatally sweet scent. Birds chirruped to each other, settling down for the night-time hours, and Psyche supposed that she, too, should begin preparations for sleep. Her disembodied attendants had lain out a night gown and lit an oil lamp, she saw. Sliding the pins out of her chiton, she let the material fall to the ground and dressed herself in the simpler tunic. With nothing else left to do, she turned back the blankets and sat on her bed. Brushing her fingers absently through her long hair, she thought of her as yet unseen new husband. Was there a chance that the oracle's prophecy had not been quite literal? A monster so great, so powerful, that even the gods themselves regarded him with trepidation. Fear pooled in her belly. Oracles were often vague, but that description left little room for interpretation. And what else had she become but a sacrifice to appease the wrath of Aphrodite? Perhaps this beast would be sent by the gods to collect her as a living offering. Then again, that possibility did not quite sit with her current situation. Psyche gazed around at the luxurious room; the walls were embedded with precious gems, the ceiling high and magnificent, the drapes a heavy, regal fabric. If she were a sacrifice, surely the gods would not create such a palace for her to spend her time in. And if she were not a sacrifice, then what of this monstrous beast? Was it merely coincidence, a matter of fate? It was possible that Aphrodite had simply wished her sent into exile, away from the eyes of men who had neglected her temples in favour of worshipping Psyche for so long. Maybe one of the gods smiled on her, and created a beautiful home to soften her exile. Perhaps the monster dwelt in these woods, and would come across her one day, take a liking and make her his bride. Psyche was much happier with this last idea than the first. If she were right, although she would still be destined to be the wife of a beast, at least she did not have the anger of a vengeful goddess to worry about. In either case, she felt she needn't worry about her absent husband for tonight. He had not appeared all through the long day, and it seemed unlikely that he would find her now. The last rays of the sun had long since faded, and once she smothered the lamp, the room would be darkened as pitch. Carefully sliding the clay lamp towards her, Psyche did just that, and then lay down, determined to forget the trials of the day and sleep. Psyche couldn't be sure how much time had passed since she had succumbed to sleep when she woke with a start, and the most curious feeling that she was no longer alone in the dark room. Opening her eyes helped her little, but sitting up, she peered into the darkness, trying to discern the shapes in the room. \"Who's there?\" she called, her voice strained from sleep. No reply came, and so she tried again, her voice a touch stronger. \" I know you're there. Who are you?\" Still the stranger said nothing, and fear was beginning to truly settle itself in Psyche's body now. Was this the monster come to claim his bride? Perhaps he had no ability for speech, and that was why he didn't reply. But she could hear no noises a beast might make; there was no panting, nor restless shifting of limbs. There was only silence. Somehow this only served to heighten Psyche's nerves. Her heart beat erratically, working so hard she could feel every thump against her chest. She frantically glanced around the room, trying desperately to catch some out-of-place shape that she could identify as man or beast. \"Psyche,\" came a full, rich masculine voice from out of the darkness. \"Be calm.\" Psyche froze. The beats of her heart resounded painfully in her throat. She clutched the blanket against the bed, as though anchoring herself. She gathered her courage and then repeated, \"Who are you?\" Again there was no response, but she had a sense that the man was moving towards her. She hardly knew what to do, how to react. If this... being was her husband, then this was her fate, and there would be no use in fighting it. Suddenly, she was aware of him kneeling directly in front of her, beside the bed. Still she could barely make out his silhouette, but from what she could see of him he did appear to be man-shaped. He reached out a hand and laid it against Psyche's cheek. She started at the contact, but was faintly surprised to discover that his skin was as soft as, if not softer than, her own. She stared straight ahead, where she imagined his eyes to be, and tentatively pressed her own hand against his jaw. She felt him swallow beneath her palm, and he brought his forehead down to rest against hers. Psyche's eyes fell closed in response to his gentle caresses. Whatever she had expected this first encounter to be like, it had not been this. The stranger pushed forward a little, bringing his lips down upon hers and peppering them with light, sweet kisses. Psyche could feel her apprehensions melting away under his seemingly affectionate attentions. But that could not be right. How could he feel affection for her when Psyche was sure they had never met before? His kisses were becoming more insistent now, and she willingly parted her lips to allow him access to her mouth. She scarcely had time to breathe between the end of one kiss and the beginning of another, and the man was soon drawing soft sighs from her that were as involuntary as the beating of her heart. He began to get up, coaxing her up with him so as not to break their embrace. Once standing, one of his arms fell about her waist, drawing her close to his body. Psyche threaded her fingers through the hair at the nape of his neck, attempting to deepen their kisses further still. His free hand, she absently noticed, had crept up to her shoulder, and was loosening the ties that held the tunic around her body. He stepped back just far enough for her clothing to drop to the mattress, and then returned, pulling her body flush against his own once more, nothing now barring their intimacy. It was then that Psyche realised that the stranger was as bare as she was, and for one frantic second, feeling his hardness pressing against her, she wanted to pull back and shy from his firm embrace. But then his lips caught hers, his hand slid up to caress the dip of her waist, and the other the swell of her breast, and the heady feeling he coaxed up in her pushed out any hesitation. Whoever this stranger was, he was masterful in the art of seduction. Every place her skin met his felt alive with heat; the tingles spreading through her from the points of contact something akin to the burns a person received from standing too long under the open sun, only with none of the pain. The man slid his hands behind her back again and pulled her in close, breaking their kiss in order to give his attention to her neck. Psyche tilted her head without giving it much thought, her mouth falling open to gasp in some much needed air. He was grazing his teeth ever so slightly over the sensitive skin beneath her jaw, occasionally sucking on one of her pulse-points, and it was sending Psyche beyond the limits of her control. It was becoming too much to keep from holding him as closely as he was her, and so Psyche let her hands rest flat against his hips as some sort of compromise between her heightening lust for him and her refusal to give in so easily to a man she knew absolutely nothing about. His reaction to her touch, however, made it impossible to resist. Almost immediately after she pressed her hands to his hot skin he stopped still, and she heard his small intake of breath. He drew his head back and Psyche could feel his gaze on her face even though she couldn't see it. She briefly wondered if this stranger could see quite easily in the dark before he brought his head closer again and rested his forehead against hers, a hand back on her cheek. Then he kissed her so tenderly, with such love, it seemed, that Psyche found it necessary to wrap her arms around him and cling tight just to remain standing. As his kisses slowly became deeper and more fervent again, Psyche found herself rubbing her palms over his lower back in encouragement. She held herself as close to him as possible; was pressing almost wantonly against him. Psyche blushed at her own behaviour, and pushed her hands higher up his back in embarrassment. Then she froze. Her hands had found a pair of muscled, feathered protrusions between the man's shoulder blades. Hesitantly she followed them back until they broadened out into what were unmistakeably a pair of wings. The pleasure he had stirred up in her was rapidly dissipating, replaced by her original fears. For all he felt and moved and acted like a man, he so obviously was not human. She tried to push away from him, but he held her tight. She shook her head and braced her hands against his chest as she struggled to break his hold, but his grip was like iron. \"Psyche,\" the man-, monster-, creature began, and Psyche stilled. He brought his hand forward and cupped her face, brushing his thumb along her cheekbone. \"Trust me.\" Psyche took a few deep breaths in the silence that followed his request. Neither moved for several moments - he seemed to be waiting for something. When Psyche finally looked up into the darkness and gave a small nod, he brought her in close to him, inadvertently trapping her hands against his chest. Dropping his head, he gave her a sweet, almost chaste kiss, then picked her up and lay her down on her bed, coming to kneel over her after a few moments, hands either side of her shoulders. Psyche felt him shift to bend lower, and soon he was gently nuzzling her neck, leaving fluttering kisses over the warm skin. He was kissing so tenderly that Psyche thought he must be trying to make her forget her doubts, or to prove his humanity. He shifted again, and moved to her mouth, giving a few chaste nips before angling his head a little and kissing her fully. He ran the tip of his tongue along her lips, silently requesting entrance, and Psyche found herself opening her mouth to allow him in. He slid his tongue along hers almost immediately, and Psyche moaned softly from the sheer pleasure of it. He felt like lazy summer days and sweetly scented mulled wine and laughter and playfulness and every good thing. But there was something solemn behind his touch. Ancient. Powerful. Immense. It was as though Psyche's spirit itself was drawn towards him, like it yearned to be close to his colossal essence, like he was deserving of worship. He was an ocean, and she was standing at a cliff-edge, his waves crashing below. Psyche closed her eyes, and let herself fall. Psyche woke the next morning to find the sun already high in the sky and the heat of the day well and truly settled in. She shifted slightly on her front, letting her eyes fall closed again and enjoying the warmth of the sun on her back. She couldn't remember a time when she'd slept so soundly. Of course, her bed at home was comfortable and she'd never been one to lose sleep on a regular basis, but this was different. She felt completely at ease, as though all her worries had seeped away in the night. Eyes flickering open, Psyche gazed at the empty space next to her on the bed. Could it be that her restfulness was thanks to the man who'd appeared last night? She'd certainly felt unaccountably relaxed and safe in his arms as she'd drifted towards sleep. It was probably reasonable to assume that feeling of security had continued through the night. The bigger question was why she'd felt so safe wrapped up in a man she knew nothing about, except that he wasn't human. The soft, downy under-feathers he'd left on the bed were testament to that fact. Psyche pushed up to rest on her elbows, and took one of the white feathers from beside her on the mattress, twirling it between her index finger and thumb. He was so unlike what she'd expected. Granted, he'd spoken scarcely five words to her in the entire night, but that her new husband even had the capacity for speech was a miracle in her eyes. The reality of him seemed utterly incongruent with the Oracle's prediction. Where she'd expected rough treatment, he'd given her tenderness. He'd been attentive and sweet and passionate and everything every woman wanted but had learned not to expect. Psyche eased her upper body back down onto the mattress and caressed the material lightly, remembering the feel of his body moving against hers, the weight of him pressing her into the bed as he kissed her neck. The dull, happy ache between her legs flared up a little, crying out for attention Psyche was not prepared to give. She rolled over and sat up, and asked into the silence if a bath might be drawn for her. She wasn't sure how she was supposed to call for the attention of her disembodied attendants, or if they just heard her regardless of where she was, but soon the sound of pouring water could be heard, and Psyche smiled. She eased herself out of bed, gently stretching the stiff muscles in her legs as she went. Her bare skin showed no hints of last night's tryst that she could see. Aside from the somehow sweet soreness, she felt no different from yesterday. Well, that wasn't quite right. There was a peacefulness in her that had been completely absent only a day ago. Psyche wondered if her sisters had experienced something similar after their marriage nights. She wasn't let in on much - those who are still virgins tend not to be included in marital discussions - but from what she'd heard them say Psyche had thought it must all be very unpleasant. Perhaps they had been keeping some of their experiences to themselves. Psyche knew she would not be comfortable talking about last night to anyone, at least. It was reasonable to assume her sisters would feel the same. Her poor family. They had spent the last weeks preparing for Psyche's journey as though preparing for her funeral. She knew her parents would actively mourn her loss for a long time, when all the time she was alive and well and living in a golden palace amidst a beautiful garden. If only there was a way to let them know she was safe, just to set their hearts at ease. Perhaps she'd ask him, when he returned, but for now her bath was ready, and there was a whole wing of the palace she hadn't had a chance to explore yesterday, and she wasn't willing to let go of the joy that filled her, not when she hadn't been happy in, oh, too long,for the sake of worrying about something she could do nothing about at the moment. Psyche wandered into the bathing room and stepped gingerly into the steaming hot water, preparing to begin a day full of exploring and relaxing and - it would be foolish to try to deny it - waiting for his return.",

      "She clutched the blanket against the bed, as though anchoring herself.",
      "She gathered her courage and then repeated, \"Who are you?\"",
      "Again there was no response, but she had a sense that the man was moving towards her.",
      "She hardly knew what to do, how to react.",
      "If this... being was her husband, then this was her fate, and there would be no use in fighting it.",
      "Suddenly, she was aware of him kneeling directly in front of her, beside the bed.",
      "Still she could barely make out his silhouette, but from what she could see of him he did appear to be man-shaped.",
      "He reached out a hand and laid it against Psyche's cheek.",
      "She started at the contact, but was faintly surprised to discover that his skin was as soft as, if not softer than, her own.",
      "She stared straight ahead, where she imagined his eyes to be, and tentatively pressed her own hand against his jaw.",
      "She felt him swallow beneath her palm, and he brought his forehead down to rest against hers.",
      "Psyche's eyes fell closed in response to his gentle caresses.",
      "Whatever she had expected this first encounter to be like, it had not been this.",
      "The stranger pushed forward a little, bringing his lips down upon hers and peppering them with light, sweet kisses.",
      "Psyche could feel her apprehensions melting away under his seemingly affectionate attentions.",
      "But that could not be right.",
      "How could he feel affection for her when Psyche was sure they had never met before?",
      "His kisses were becoming more insistent now, and she willingly parted her lips to allow him access to her mouth.",
      "She scarcely had time to breathe between the end of one kiss and the beginning of another, and the man was soon drawing soft sighs from her that were as involuntary as the beating of her heart.",
      "He began to get up, coaxing her up with him so as not to break their embrace.",
      "Once standing, one of his arms fell about her waist, drawing her close to his body.",
      "Psyche threaded her fingers through the hair at the nape of his neck, attempting to deepen their kisses further still.",
      "His free hand, she absently noticed, had crept up to her shoulder, and was loosening the ties that held the tunic around her body.",
      "He stepped back just far enough for her clothing to drop to the mattress, and then returned, pulling her body flush against his own once more, nothing now barring their intimacy.",
      "It was then that Psyche realised that the stranger was as bare as she was, and for one frantic second, feeling his hardness pressing against her, she wanted to pull back and shy from his firm embrace.",
      "But then his lips caught hers, his hand slid up to caress the dip of her waist, and the other the swell of her breast, and the heady feeling he coaxed up in her pushed out any hesitation.",
      "Whoever this stranger was, he was masterful in the art of seduction.",
      "Every place her skin met his felt alive with heat; the tingles spreading through her from the points of contact something akin to the burns a person received from standing too long under the open sun, only with none of the pain.",
      "The man slid his hands behind her back again and pulled her in close, breaking their kiss in order to give his attention to her neck.",
      "Psyche tilted her head without giving it much thought, her mouth falling open to gasp in some much needed air.",
      "He was grazing his teeth ever so slightly over the sensitive skin beneath her jaw, occasionally sucking on one of her pulse-points, and it was sending Psyche beyond the limits of her control.",
      "It was becoming too much to keep from holding him as closely as he was her, and so Psyche let her hands rest flat against his hips as some sort of compromise between her heightening lust for him and her refusal to give in so easily to a man she knew absolutely nothing about.",
      "His reaction to her touch, however, made it impossible to resist.",
      "Almost immediately after she pressed her hands to his hot skin he stopped still, and she heard his small intake of breath.",
      "He drew his head back and Psyche could feel his gaze on her face even though she couldn't see it.",
      "She briefly wondered if this stranger could see quite easily in the dark before he brought his head closer again and rested his forehead against hers, a hand back on her cheek.",
      "Then he kissed her so tenderly, with such love, it seemed, that Psyche found it necessary to wrap her arms around him and cling tight just to remain standing.",
      "As his kisses slowly became deeper and more fervent again, Psyche found herself rubbing her palms over his lower back in encouragement.",
      "She held herself as close to him as possible; was pressing almost wantonly against him.",
      "Psyche blushed at her own behaviour, and pushed her hands higher up his back in embarrassment.",
      "Then she froze.",
      "Her hands had found a pair of muscled, feathered protrusions between the man's shoulder blades.",
      "Hesitantly she followed them back until they broadened out into what were unmistakeably a pair of wings.",
      "The pleasure he had stirred up in her was rapidly dissipating, replaced by her original fears.",
      "For all he felt and moved and acted like a man, he so obviously was not human.",
      "She tried to push away from him, but he held her tight.",
      "She shook her head and braced her hands against his chest as she struggled to break his hold, but his grip was like iron.",
      "\"Psyche,\" the man-, monster-, creature began, and Psyche stilled.",
      "He brought his hand forward and cupped her face, brushing his thumb along her cheekbone.",
      "\"Trust me.\"",
      "Psyche took a few deep breaths in the silence that followed his request.",
      "Neither moved for several moments - he seemed to be waiting for something.",
      "When Psyche finally looked up into the darkness and gave a small nod, he brought her in close to him, inadvertently trapping her hands against his chest.",
      "Dropping his head, he gave her a sweet, almost chaste kiss, then picked her up and lay her down on her bed, coming to kneel over her after a few moments, hands either side of her shoulders.",
      "Psyche felt him shift to bend lower, and soon he was gently nuzzling her neck, leaving fluttering kisses over the warm skin.",
      "He was kissing so tenderly that Psyche thought he must be trying to make her forget her doubts, or to prove his humanity.",
      "He shifted again, and moved to her mouth, giving a few chaste nips before angling his head a little and kissing her fully.",
      "He ran the tip of his tongue along her lips, silently requesting entrance, and Psyche found herself opening her mouth to allow him in.",
      "He slid his tongue along hers almost immediately, and Psyche moaned softly from the sheer pleasure of it.",
      "He felt like lazy summer days and sweetly scented mulled wine and laughter and playfulness and every good thing.",
      "But there was something solemn behind his touch.",
      "Ancient.",
      "Powerful.",
      "Immense.",
      "It was as though Psyche's spirit itself was drawn towards him, like it yearned to be close to his colossal essence, like he was deserving of worship.",
      "He was an ocean, and she was standing at a cliff-edge, his waves crashing below.",
      "Psyche closed her eyes, and let herself fall.",
      "Psyche woke the next morning to find the sun already high in the sky and the heat of the day well and truly settled in.",
      "She shifted slightly on her front, letting her eyes fall closed again and enjoying the warmth of the sun on her back.",
      "She couldn't remember a time when she'd slept so soundly.",
      "Of course, her bed at home was comfortable and she'd never been one to lose sleep on a regular basis, but this was different.",
      "She felt completely at ease, as though all her worries had seeped away in the night.",
      "Eyes flickering open, Psyche gazed at the empty space next to her on the bed.",
      "Could it be that her restfulness was thanks to the man who'd appeared last night?",
      "She'd certainly felt unaccountably relaxed and safe in his arms as she'd drifted towards sleep.",
      "It was probably reasonable to assume that feeling of security had continued through the night.",
      "The bigger question was why she'd felt so safe wrapped up in a man she knew nothing about, except that he wasn't human.",
      "The soft, downy under-feathers he'd left on the bed were testament to that fact.",
      "Psyche pushed up to rest on her elbows, and took one of the white feathers from beside her on the mattress, twirling it between her index finger and thumb.",
      "He was so unlike what she'd expected.",
      "Granted, he'd spoken scarcely five words to her in the entire night, but that her new husband even had the capacity for speech was a miracle in her eyes.",
      "The reality of him seemed utterly incongruent with the Oracle's prediction.",
      "Where she'd expected rough treatment, he'd given her tenderness.",
      "He'd been attentive and sweet and passionate and everything every woman wanted but had learned not to expect.",
      "Psyche eased her upper body back down onto the mattress and caressed the material lightly, remembering the feel of his body moving against hers, the weight of him pressing her into the bed as he kissed her neck.",
      "The dull, happy ache between her legs flared up a little, crying out for attention Psyche was not prepared to give.",
      "She rolled over and sat up, and asked into the silence if a bath might be drawn for her.",
      "She wasn't sure how she was supposed to call for the attention of her disembodied attendants, or if they just heard her regardless of where she was, but soon the sound of pouring water could be heard, and Psyche smiled.",
      "She eased herself out of bed, gently stretching the stiff muscles in her legs as she went.",
      "Her bare skin showed no hints of last night's tryst that she could see.",
      "Aside from the somehow sweet soreness, she felt no different from yesterday.",
      "Well, that wasn't quite right.",
      "There was a peacefulness in her that had been completely absent only a day ago.",
      "Psyche wondered if her sisters had experienced something similar after their marriage nights.",
      "She wasn't let in on much - those who are still virgins tend not to be included in marital discussions - but from what she'd heard them say Psyche had thought it must all be very unpleasant.",
      "Perhaps they had been keeping some of their experiences to themselves.",
      "Psyche knew she would not be comfortable talking about last night to anyone, at least.",
      "It was reasonable to assume her sisters would feel the same.",
      "Her poor family.",
      "They had spent the last weeks preparing for Psyche's journey as though preparing for her funeral.",
      "She knew her parents would actively mourn her loss for a long time, when all the time she was alive and well and living in a golden palace amidst a beautiful garden.",
      "If only there was a way to let them know she was safe, just to set their hearts at ease.",
      "Perhaps she'd ask him, when he returned, but for now her bath was ready, and there was a whole wing of the palace she hadn't had a chance to explore yesterday, and she wasn't willing to let go of the joy that filled her, not when she hadn't been happy in, oh, too long,for the sake of worrying about something she could do nothing about at the moment.",
      "Psyche wandered into the bathing room and stepped gingerly into the steaming hot water, preparing to begin a day full of exploring and relaxing and - it would be foolish to try to deny it - waiting for his return."

    "text": "She was a heathen, a mortal of a foreign land. One that didn't awknowledge the pantheon of Gods he belonged to. She had little care for his Roman identity and even less for his true name. Yet the God of War could not help but feel drawn to her; more so than any mortal he had seen before, perhaps more so than Aphrodite herself. Even as her allies fell around her, decimated by Ares forces, she continued to fight. Her teeth were bared as she swung her sword. She appeared to be a savage barbarian yet she slayed with the precision of a marksman. Her blade would cut into a vital organ or artery before finding another victim just as swiftly. For the first time he understood Athena's claim that war was art, and he agreed with it. Saxa fought with a ferocity that rivaled his sisters Eris and Enyo, even in the face of certain death. Perhaps that was why as his troops surrounded her and the remaining enemies he gave the order to keep her alive. It was no easy task mind you, considering she kept fighting to the end; but eventually with no weapon in her hand and bodies bearing down on her, she was restrained. \"Bring her to me\" he ordered, turning to head to his tent. \"And the rest?\" \"Destroy them of course\" Ares said, resisting the urge to kill the soldier on the spot for such a stupid question. He was still the God of War, he still craved violence and bloodshed. One act of mercy didn't change that, especially one act based on self-interest. When the savage was finally brought into his tent, Ares' eyes immediately went to her. Her hands were tied and she was covered in a tunic top and similar bottom to cover what little modesty she had. However it was not the sexuality, or curves he was drawn to, those were traits for Eros to admire. It was the pride she held herself with, the strength that radiated off of her and the defiance she looked at him with. The God had many partners, but partners he respected were far and fewer in between. To gain his respect you had to prove yourself to be more than a housewife, more than a woman who sat next to the throne and looked pretty. Saxa had certainly proved that to him here today. There was no woman he respected more than a woman who could call herself a warrior. \"Do you know who I am?\" he asked simply as he stood, his muscular frame towering over hers. Her words were in a foreign tongue, but her demeanor did not change. If anything she had become more defiant. It took Ares but a second to adjust to the new language. Despite his natural tongue being Greek, he was still a God. Translating such things were of ease. \"Do you know who I am?\" he repeated again in German, the words were effortless but still left a strange taste in his mouth. Saxa appeared surprised at first before the frown returned to her face, \"A false god of the pathetic Romans\" she spat, her aggression as evident as ever. \"I am no false God, barbarian\" Ares returned his own expression growing sour. He was not one for patience or insults, all the respect in the cosmos couldn't change that. \"And while the Romans honor me in different ways, I am praised by the Greeks.\" Saxa merely glared at him, making no move to bow before the revealed God. \"You fought like a true warrior. You crave the bloodshed, I can see it in your very being, in your soul.\" \"I crave your blood, God\" Ares was on her in a flash, her face grasped between her fingers, the fury burning in his eyes. Had he not had other intentions, he would have snapped her neck in that instant. He hardly had patience for his brothers and sisters which meant he had none for mortals when they dared disrespect or challenge him. \"You have an unquenchable thirst for battle, mortal, much like I. But do not mistake me for one of you. I am Ares, the God of War!\" his voice grew in volume as he declared himself, to which Saxa replied with a sinister smirk. \"Am I supposed to give a fuck?\" No sooner had the question left her lips did Ares crash his own against hers, his hand moving to her waist to lift her. She responded instinctively, her lips moving aggressively against the god's as his tongue battled hers for dominance. Her strong legs wrapped around his waist tightly, her bound hands the only thing between them. Saxa craved control but she desired someone her could match her in that craving. In Ares she had found that someone and more. Ares moved them to the nearest table, slamming her down onto it and forcing a grunt to reverberate against his lips. She raised her hands above her head, the ropes forcing her into a somewhat submissive state as he bore down on her. Ares had never been one for caresses and confession during sex and he emphasized that point by ripping off her top, exposing her delicious breast to him. He cupped one in his hand before leaning down to suck the nipple into his mouth, earning a moan of pleasure from the female warrior. He bit and tugged at it before giving the other breast the same treatment. By the time he had finished his arousal was evident against her bare thigh and he had had enough foreplay for a century. Ridding himself of his trousers he looked at Saxa with a lustful gaze. She returned the stare, encouraging, almost daring him to go through with it; to take the heathen and try to break her. So he did. In one powerful thrust the God of War penetrated her, a deep moan escaping his lips as he did so. His length was stretching her to unimaginable level, sending signals of pain and pleasure to her brain. But neither Ares nor Saxa had patience for comfort. Without a moments hesitation he withdrew from her and entered her again, the table shuddering from the pressure as he felt her tightness clamping down around him. Saxa let out a feral moan, her teeth tugging at his bottom lip roughly as he began fucking her. Her breast bounced on their own accord as Ares set a fast and hard pace; the arousal of having just been in battle driving him even further. The bloodshed always gave him a sort of erotic high that was dangerous when left ignored. The fact that Saxa had been part of that bloodshed only added to that sensation. The welcome pain that shot up her spine with each thrust only added to the overwhelming pleasure she was receiving. She arched her back off the table, her chest molding into his as a moan left her lips. Ares grunted with each piercing thrust, sweat starting to roll off of his pristine body as he did. He moved one hand from her waist to grope her exposed breast pulling and pinching as their lips met. Their kisses were aggressive and passionate, seeming like two animals in heat. She screamed in pleasure as he increased the speed of his thrusts, his member pistoning in and out of her tight warmth. The geman warrior desperately wanted to make use of her hands, her wrists writhing against the constraints causing burns to mark her wrists. The fact that she couldn't only angered her and fueled the heated passion between them. Her legs wrapped tighter around Ares waist, forcing the greek god even deeper into her. A gasp broke from her lips only to be silenced by a kiss. Saxa bit his bottom lip hard, drawing blood from god and licking it off his lip with her tongue. The erotic action brought a smirk to her lips as she looked up at him. \"I was right to crave your blood\" she spoke, licking his lower lip to get the rest of the blood. \"You will have much more than my blood\" he grunted the promise and Saxa's smirk grew even wider. The former rebel rolled her hips aggressively, doing her best to meet his hips and keep pace with the unrelenting rhythm he had set. The action sent waves of pleasure over Ares' senses. He always preferred an active, aggressive partner to one who was complacent; and Saxa was anything but complacent. Her walls began to tighten around his cock as he pounded into her relentlessly, her hips bucking back against his. Ares recognized the familiar signs of an orgasm approaching; her body arching against his, her head rolling back as her legs clapped down around him. She let out a sound that was a mix between a moan and a shriek as her orgasm hit her. The God of War didn't slow his thrust as she came around him, instead maintaining the same intensity. It wasn't long though before he felt his on release nearing. Saxa's body was still shuddering with her own orgasm as Ares let out a feral growl, erupting deep inside her, coating her walls with his seed. He continued pumping into her until they were both spent. It was only by his godly strength that he was able to hold himself up and look at her. \"You will be with me now.\" \"No man nor god shall own me. I would rather fight and die than become a slave\" Ares was amazed, even after that she still had as much defiance and strength in her words as before. \"You misunderstood me\" he shook his head, his eyes meeting hers. \"You shall be by my side at every battle. We will slay hordes together; and you will be my wife.\" Saxa was silent after hearing his words. She knew that she should hate this man and be plotting her revenge, after all he and his army slayed her comrades. Yet she couldn't deny there was a primal desire there. And that the idea of being a queen of war appealed to that desire. \"Release my hands.\" The request was simple enough but said with a very deliberate tone. Ares stared down at her for a moment, trying to read what her intentions were. Of course he didn't have anything to fear regardless. With a small nod he snapped his fingers and the ropes around her wrists disappeared. The first thing he noticed were the red burn marks from her resistance. Saxa took a brief moment to rub her wrists before using all her strength to maneuver herself on top of the God of War. She flipped their bodies over, pushing him down against the table. Her nails trailed down his chest, leaving a trail of red as she began to rock back and forth on his cock. \"I will bow to no God\" she stated. Ares met her gaze, enjoying the renewed pleasure. He didn't often give control to his partner but this was certainly an exception. \"It would not be expected. Gods would bow to you.\" Saxa's lips curled into a smirk, pleased by the answer she had received. If she was going to agree to anything she had to get her terms out first. Her hips rocked more aggressively against his, her head rolling back as she let out a laugh. Ares merely smirked as she did so, knowing he had his answer. His rough, hardened hands moved up her torso, cupping her breast as she sat atop him. \"I will be your queen God of War and you shall be my king. There is but one condition.\" Ares groaned loudly as she began to bounce up and down on his cock, her walls squeezing around him. The god of war couldn't remember the last time a mortal woman had given him pleasure to this extent; nor did he care. Saxa continued to ride him until her senses were at a near delirium. She came howling and shuddering, her body convulsing on top of the god as he continued thrusting his hips up against hers. His fingers dug into her waist as he came, unleashing a torrent of his seed inside her. The load had been even more explosive than the first and when it was over Ares had a genuine feeling of fatigue. Saxa slowly leaned forward, lowering herself until her chest was flat against his. She kissed along his neck momentarily before her gaze reached his. \"What is your condition?\" demanded the God. \"Romans. I want revenge against them, a specific group\" she spoke simply and straight to the point. A smirk crossed Ares features as he let out a short laugh. \"I will gladly fulfill that request. Not only is it bloodshed, but a bit of personal payback for myself as well.\" Saxa grinned at his words. She had been afraid the god would not want to go against those who worshiped him, though it seemed Ares found people expendable, as they were. \"Come, there is much blood to be spilt yet\" Ares said as he rolled out from under Saxa. Before moving to gather his armor he leaned over, placing a passionate kiss to her soft lips. The God of War had found his warrior queen and the cosmos themselves trembled in fear.",

      "Saxa continued to ride him until her senses were at a near delirium.",
      "She came howling and shuddering, her body convulsing on top of the god as he continued thrusting his hips up against hers.",
      "His fingers dug into her waist as he came, unleashing a torrent of his seed inside her.",
      "The load had been even more explosive than the first and when it was over Ares had a genuine feeling of fatigue.",
      "Saxa slowly leaned forward, lowering herself until her chest was flat against his.",
      "She kissed along his neck momentarily before her gaze reached his.",
      "\"What is your condition?\" demanded the God.",
      "\"Romans.",
      "I want revenge against them, a specific group\" she spoke simply and straight to the point.",
      "A smirk crossed Ares features as he let out a short laugh.",
      "\"I will gladly fulfill that request.",
      "Not only is it bloodshed, but a bit of personal payback for myself as well.\"",
      "Saxa grinned at his words.",
      "She had been afraid the god would not want to go against those who worshiped him, though it seemed Ares found people expendable, as they were.",
      "\"Come, there is much blood to be spilt yet\" Ares said as he rolled out from under Saxa.",
      "Before moving to gather his armor he leaned over, placing a passionate kiss to her soft lips.",
      "The God of War had found his warrior queen and the cosmos themselves trembled in fear."

    "text": "A sacrifice at one of his countless altars calls him, and Zeus slips into the form of a giant eagle, soaring through the skies at a pace no true bird could hope to match. Circling over the altar, he sees her. A young priestess, her devotion almost tangible to his acute senses as she slaughters the giant bull and speaks her prayers. She is beautiful, but Zeus has known many beautiful young women. He is about to turn away, to ride the current of the air back towards Olympus, when she looks up. He abandons the thermal he was soaring on and spirals downwards, caught in the depth of her eyes. In her mask of absolute devotion, they betray the emotions she has hidden deep inside herself, where no one but a god could see. Unable to look away from those eyes, he feels the swirling mix of emotions but it is the loneliness that calls out to him, overwhelming his senses. A loneliness so intense he cannot understand how she has hidden it so long. Suddenly he wants nothing more than to ease that pain, to make her smile, to light up those eyes. It is not the prayer the priestess has spoken, but it is the one he will grant. **** Semele takes several steps back as the eagle plummets towards her in a tight and seemingly barely controlled spiral. At the last second it opens its wings to break its fall, coming to land gracefully on top of the carcass of the bull she has just slaughtered on Zeus's altar. For a moment, neither she nor the majestic bird moves, as she stares into its eyes - eyes that carry far too much intelligence even for a bird of prey. A faint suspicion begins to dawn in the back of her mind and her eyes widen in amazement, but before she can say or do anything, the bird launches itself once more into the skies with an unearthly cry. She remains rooted to the spot for several moments, following the path of the eagle's flight as it soars in wide circles high above her. \"Zeus\" she whispers once more, looking not at the altar this time but into the sky, \"accept this sacrifice.\" Then, slowly, she turns and makes her way toward the river to cleanse herself of the animal's blood. **** \"Zeus, accept this sacrifice.\" The words reach his ears as clearly as if she had been standing in front of him. He knows she is referring to the bull that lies on the altar, but in his mind he sees the image of her eyes, so full of pain and loneliness, set into a mask of emotionless devotion, and he wonders if she knows the true meaning of her words. **** She removes her bloodstained clothes and walks slowly into the river, trailing her fingertips on the surface and watching as the current carries away the blood of the animal she has sacrificed. She submerges herself in the water, trying to appreciate its cool touch but she can't shake the feeling that she is being watched. She thinks back to the eagle that had alighted on the altar and a shiver runs through her. She looks over her shoulder but there is no one there. And then, suddenly, there is. She stares in amazement and shock as he approaches her. His footfalls make no sound, it is as though he has simply melted out of the grove of trees by the river's edge. He is barely clothed, and she allows her eyes to linger for a fraction of a second longer than she knows she should. Then with a start, she remembers herself and swiftly turns her back in an attempt to preserve a scrap of modesty and hide the blush that is spreading across her cheeks. \"I am sorry to have startled you, Lady.\" She tries to compose herself, combing out her long, dark hair with fingers that tremble slightly despite her best efforts. She does not hear him enter the water, but suddenly she feels another pair of hands gently working the strands of her wet hair, brushing softly against the skin of her back. She shivers, and turns slowly until she is facing him, standing in his arms with hardly even the river between them. She should step back, cover herself, run away. But her legs won't obey her halfhearted command. **** \"Who are you?\" The girl asks. Zeus allows himself a small smile. \"I think you know the answer to that,\" he says. She nods slowly. \"What do you want?\" she asks in a whisper. It takes a huge amount of effort to prevent his gaze from raking over her exposed body. He has known many beautiful women, but he has rarely needed to exhibit restraint. \"I think you know that answer too - \" he begins, and she looks up at him, meeting his eyes in something like shock. So close, the turmoil within them threatens to overwhelm him once more, but he manages to maintain control. \"--but it's not what I want that matters right now.\" \"But...\" her emotionless mask has dissolved and he can read the confusion in her face, as easily as the unspoken end to her protest. But you're Zeus.\"What I want doesn't matter,\" he says again, \"right now, what's important is what you want.\" For a moment, neither of them moves. Then she closes her eyes, but not before he can see the flicker of desire, of need, that flits across them. She tilts her face slightly towards him, just slightly, and he moves one hand to cup the back of her neck, twining into her still-wet hair. Then he waits until she moves - until she brings her lips to meet his, and reaches her arms around his neck, and takes the last step forwards - before he pulls her closer to him until the river that flowed between them is forced to find a new path. **** Semele makes her way slowly back along the path, combing her hair and smoothing her clothes; trying to make herself look less as though she has just been ravished by a god. But she is distracted, remembering his fingers in her hair, his surprisingly gentle hands across her body, his less gentle insistence - or was it compliance? She is not entirely sure whose desire was being fulfilled. What I want doesn't matter. Right now, what's important is what you want, he had said. Is this what she wants? She stops suddenly as she realises that she doesn't actually know the answer. She is trying to search through her own desires and wishes - the ones she has hidden beneath her mental veil, the veil that keeps her face impassive and her emotions under control - when she realises that she has never been asked what she wants before. **** Zeus returns to the skies but circles widely, lazily, in lieu of returning directly to Olympus. Hera will be waiting for him there, and he knows he cannot return now, not with his eyes still full of Semele, his thoughts occupied by her unspoken prayers - unspoken even to herself. Hera cannot know. Zeus knows what would happen then, and he knows that he must protect the priestess at all costs. Were Hera to learn of Semele, Zeus would never succeed in making her smile, no matter how hard he tried. She would already be too broken. Never, in all his countless years, has Zeus learned to repair the damage his wife can cause. And he has never learned to cope with the subsequent guilt. Because it never is Hera's fault, really. It's his own. **** Semele is distracted in her duties at the temple. Where she was once purposeful, stoic, proud and obedient she now performs all her tasks as though she is sleepwalking. Sometimes she stops in the middle of sweeping the floors, or carrying water, or lighting the candles, holding the burning match in her hand and gazing off into the distance, lost in reverie, brought back to earth only by the sound of someone shouting her name to warn her of the flame that is beginning to lick her fingers. She is slow in the mornings now. For years she was always the first one awake; she would be washed and clothed before the other girls had hardly begun to stir. These mornings she would comb her hair slowly, her eyes focused on a memory, recalling how Zeus's fingers met hers, how he stroked her hair as they kissed, tangled it as they made love. In her more lucid moments, she hears the others begin to whisper. Proud Semele, they would say, not so much better than us after all. Always so modest, ha. She must think we don't know. Semele tries to ignore them, tried to keep her chin up, shoulders back, face impassive. She has always been aloof, apart from the others. She is accustomed to conversations occurring around her but never including her. The only real difference now is the tone. **** Zeus avoids Hera, avoids meeting her eyes. This is nothing new for either of them - marriage grows tedious after the first few millennia. He does not doubt that she knows what he is doing. As long as she doesn't know who he's doing it with, Semele will remain safe. So he leaves Olympus whenever he can, soaring out of the pantheon on his eagle's wings, floating on the air currents that always seem to carry him back to the same place. He circles the altar for hours, waiting for the priestess, waiting for a glimpse of her eyes, but dreading it at the same time. He wonders how a human girl can survive the emotions that make him tremble. She is stronger than the others he has known. After days of watching the altar, he is rewarded by the sight of the young woman leading a young calf to the altar. He dives downwards with a cry and sees a flicker of astonishment and the shadow of something akin to excitement in her eyes as he lands. He casts off the eagle's shape and turns to Semele. \"Let the calf free. I would never think to request another sacrifice from you. You have given more than enough already.\" **** Semele pauses, uncertain of how to interpret his words. \"I...I'll just go, then,\" she finally says, turning slowly and fighting to keep her face closed, her eyes dry. \"I was not asking you to leave,\" he says from behind her, softly. It is not a command but she stops and turns around once more. \"But you said...\" she begins, puzzled. He shakes his head, and for a moment she catches a glimpse of something almost like sadness in his sculpted face. \"I was just referring to the calf,\" he says, reassuring. \"You do not need to bring a sacrifice in order to come here. Simply calling my name will suffice.\" \"Zeus,\" she whispers softly, looking up at him. \"I'm here,\" he replies even more softly, drawing her in to a close embrace, his hands in her hair, his lips brushing against her ear and then her mouth. The kiss deepens and she can still hardly believe that this is Zeus, that she's kissing a god. Moments later she pulls away breathlessly. \"Maybe...shouldn't we move away from the altar?\" She asks in response to his inquisitive look. He only laughs in reply and lifts her slightly so she is sitting on the altar - his altar. She hesitates only for a moment before winding her fingers into his hair and wrapping her legs around his waist as they pick up where they left off. **** Lying naked on the altar, Semele looks almost like a virgin sacrifice. But Zeus has already made sure she is no longer a virgin, and he will not allow her to become a sacrifice. She is not - shame washes over him as he thinks the name - Leda. This is her choice as much as it is his. He is a god, but he will not take from her what is not offered. **** Semele no longer tries to hide her secret from the other priestesses. The next weeks pass by in a blur of her ordinary temple duties, which she fulfils mindlessly, thinking only of her next visit to the altar, to the grove of trees by the river, to her god. The others know she is seeing someone, but none of them suspect the full truth. She does not tell them, and they continue to despise her. And for once, Semele doesn't mind. For once, she has a way to assuage the loneliness that has been an inevitability in her life ever since she was given up to the temple by parents that refused to admit they had borne a daughter. For the other girls, it is an honour. For Semele, it is simply life. But now it is not all her life. Now there is someone else, someone who has not abandoned her - despite all the stories of his liaisons with mortals. Someone she can talk to, someone who will listen - another trait the stories fail to mention. For the first time, Semele knows what it means to anticipate something, to look forward eagerly to those stolen hours in the grove by the river, to feel the excitement flow through her at the thought of meeting her lover. She wonders vaguely if it would be the same with someone else - not a god, just a mortal who happened to love her. **** Hera's suspicion increases with each passing day, but though Zeus knows, he cannot cease his visits to Semele, cannot hide the fact that he is falling in love with the girl he once vowed to make smile. He had gone to her on a compulsion he had taken for pity, knowing that his success would imply her love for him. But he never expected to reciprocate it. Zeus has known many women, but has loved very few. Love is Aphrodite's domain, fidelity is Hera's. He, Zeus is beginning to realise, is not so different from other men. He simply fulfils his desires more easily, courtesy of being a god. He has often wondered if no one has ever truly loved Semele, if this is the reason behind the sadness in her eyes. But now he wonders if he himself has ever truly loved anyone. And in realising the answer, he understands why Hera is so furious - and at the same time why she has not yet acted. She has never felt more than passing irritation at his previous relations, the ones that meant nothing. But now she sees him falling in love, and for the first time, Hera is hurt. She is angry, she is vengeful, she is annoyed. But primarily, he realises with a flash of pity, she is in pain. Because after spending millennia at his side, she finally sees him fall in love. Just not with her. **** 'Semele.' Semele is startled at the sound of her name, spoken quietly by someone just beyond the trees of the grove. She is unaccustomed to anyone's presence here, except for that of Zeus. He has just left; she can just barely make out his eagle's form soaring high above her, back to Olympus. \"Yes?\" Semele calls out, her voice shaking only slightly, as she quickly pulls on her clothes and tries to run her fingers through her tangled hair. A girl, slightly younger than Semele, steps into the grove. Her eyes widen slightly as she takes in Semele's dishevelled appearance. Semele knows what she must look like, but makes no effort to hide it. Her deep blush is her only concession to any remnant of shame she feels. The girl - a young priestess at the temple, Semele assumes based on her clothing and the fact that she knows Semele's name - smiles conspiratorially. \"I was...worried about you,\" the girl says, \"you seemed...well, like you needed someone to talk to, I guess. But I suppose I shouldn't have worried,\" she adds with a smirk. Semele returns the smile, her cheeks still furiously red. \"Thank you,\" she says. \"So...\" the girl begins, \"who was it? Anyone I would know?\" **** As soon as Zeus returns to Olympus, he knows something is wrong. Hera is not there waiting to berate or interrogate him. He asks several of the other gods and goddesses, but none of them can enlighten him as to the whereabouts of his wife. That can only mean one thing. She has gone to get her revenge. He is suddenly filled with a panic so strong it shocks him. He has to find Semele, has to warn her. Zeus launches himself from Olympus, once more winging his way towards the temple in his eagle's form. He has only been away from Semele for a few moments, it seems. He hopes he is right in thinking that is far too little time for Hera to act, hopes that he will not arrive too late. But he fears that he is wrong. He slows as he reaches their grove, and begins to circle. It doesn't take him long to spot Semele, seated by the river, deep in conversation with what appears to be just another young priestess. But Zeus can see through Hera's disguise immediately, and he knows he is too late. An inexpressible feeling of sorrow and loss and pain fills him, and a keening cry rips from his throat. Both women look up at the unearthly sound, both recognise the eagle immediately. And this time, Semele's eyes are not the only ones brimming with intense and complex emotions. **** Semele has just finished telling the younger priestess - after some initial hesitation - the truth about her lover, when she hears a cry from the heavens that strikes something deep inside of her, and she looks up immediately to see a giant eagle circling over her, crying out in something like despair. She cannot imagine what would have caused him to make such a sound - or even why he would have returned so quickly - until she looks back at the other priestess, intending to feign a confused but dismissive shrug and continue the conversation. But something in the other girl's eyes stops her. The girl's expression is not unlike her own, and her eyes...there is something unnatural about them. Like Zeus's eyes, they seem to contain far more than any mortal's ever could. Semele draws in a shocked breath as realisation dawns on her. For several moments, neither of them speaks. \"He loves you, you know,\" Hera finally says, a single tear falling from her immortal's eyes. **** Zeus has no real option but to leave - there is nothing more he can do, short of confronting Hera directly, in front of Semele. He hardly entertains the idea for longer than a second, knowing that the sight of two such powerful gods clashing with each other would kill her. He cries out again to the wind with frustration and pain, for having failed to protect the girl he loves from the inevitable revenge of the goddess he should. **** Semele is unsure how to respond, so she remains quiet until Hera collects herself with a quick shake of her head. When Hera speaks again there is no sign of the pain, the vulnerability she had allowed to escape just moments before. \"What did he do to seduce you? Promise you the earth and sky, and everything in between? Promise you all the gold and riches you could ever hope for? Or was it enough for him to stand there looking like the most beautiful man in the world and your legs just fell open for him?\" Semele is taken aback by the harsh tone of Hera's words, the underlying accusation, and yet she is compelled to answer, and to do so as honestly as possible. She thinks back to that first meeting, when he ran his fingers through her hair and kissed away the pain of her loneliness as they made love in the river where she washed away the traces of the sacrifice she had made. **** Zeus sits upon his throne at Olympus, turning a thunderbolt over and over in his hands - the only reminder that he is not in fact powerless. There is nothing he can do to stop whatever plan Hera has put in motion. He has never been able to outwit her, never been able to forestall her. He wants to unleash his guilt and fury and pain upon the world, wants to rip open the sky with thunder and ignite it with his lightning, but he knows it would be futile. A cool hand touches his shoulder gently, but Zeus does not look up. \"You love her, don't you?\" his brother Poseidon asks softly. Zeus does not respond. \"Zeus...you're not going to like this, but...she's mortal. She'll die eventually. You're going to have to give her up sometime.\" \"I know she's going to die at some point,\" Zeus replies tonelessly, \"I just wanted her to smile first.\" **** \"He gave me a choice,\" Semele says finally. \"He listened to me. To what I wanted. When I was...\" she hesitates for a moment, unsure of opening herself to a goddess she has angered. \"When I'm with him I feel...like I'm actually alive. Like I'm a human being, like I have thoughts and feelings and wants that matter.\" She cannot interpret the expression on Hera's face as she finishes softly, \"everyone else I've known seems to forget that.\" When Hera speaks again her voice sounds different, and Semele is shocked to see the glimmer of withheld tears in her eyes. \"Are you certain of that?\" Hera asks. \"You do not know him as I do. How certain are you that he truly cares what you want? That he will not break his promise to get what he wants? How do you know he won't hurt you? How can you be sure that he won't discard you without a second thought as soon as someone else captures his interest? How can you trust his word?\" The restraint in Hera's voice threatens to crack, and Semele knows the goddess is not only speaking to her. \"He wouldn't,\" she says in a voice barely above a whisper. She has heard the stories, of course. But she cannot equate that Zeus with the god that loved her in the grove by the river. \"Wouldn't he? Let me tell you a story,\" Hera says, her voice cool and even once more. \"Let me tell you about a girl named Leda.\" **** Zeus does not notice when his brother leaves, but he senses Hera's presence as soon as she enters the room. He does not acknowledge her, afraid that any movement but the constant turning of the thunderbolt in his hands would see him lose control completely.\"She's still alive,\" Hera says, her voice carefully controlled, but not quite enough to hide the icy fury underneath. \"Alive and human. You should thank me.\" \"What have you done to her?\" Zeus asks, spinning the lightning bolt faster and faster. \"Nothing really,\" Hera says, \"I just gave her something to think about, that's all.\" Zeus finally looks up to meet her eyes, and hears a small clap of thunder as his control slips momentarily. \"Why?\" He asks. \"Why? Because she needs to know what she's getting herself into.\" \"No. Why do you do this?\" \"You honestly don't know?\" Hera asks. \"Zeus, I know how you feel right now.\" Zeus shakes his head. \"You have no idea.\" He turns his gaze back to the thunderbolt in his hands. \"I do. I know exactly how this feels. Do you want to know how?\" He does not reply. \"I love you, Zeus. Believe me, I wish I did not. But I do, and every time you spurn me for a mortal, every time you cast me aside, I wish I could stop loving you, because then this wouldn't hurt. And now you love this mortal girl, and you know you are going to lose her. Well, Zeus, that's how I've felt for the past millennia. Don't tell me I don't understand how you feel.\" She wipes angrily at a tear, almost too quickly for him to see. Almost. \"But why must you hurt Semele? She is innocent. You do not have to destroy her like this.\" \"I am not the one who hurt her. I am never the one who hurts your mortal playthings. Think about that, Zeus. Because I can guarantee you that's what Semele is doing.\" And with that she turns and storms out of the room, but not before Zeus can hear the choked sob that escapes her as she opens the door. **** For the first time since meeting Zeus in the river that first day, Semele is confused. The story Hera told, and the things she said, are still running through Semele's mind, try as she might to push them away. She does not want to doubt, does not want to destroy this one fragment of pure happiness in her life. She knows Hera's stories are true, but she wants to believe that she is different, that the past means nothing. But then there is also the suggestion Hera made, or hinted at. It threads its way through her thoughts as well, much less intrusive but much more difficult to block out. And despite herself, Semele begins to consider. **** More than anything, Zeus wants to go to Semele, to see her, tell her that everything he has told her is true. But he knows he cannot, knows that he must wait until she calls for him. He has made a promise to her. So he waits, knowing that she may never want to speak to him again, but knowing just as well that it would be within her right. He has not spoken to Hera, and she makes no attempt to approach him. At times he finds himself running through their last conversation. I love you, Zeus. I wish I could stop loving you. He thinks of the infinite loneliness in Semele's eyes, the immortal pain in Hera's. The defeated surrender in the last look Leda cast him. As his own eyes sparkle with the lightning he fights to hold back, he wonders if he will ever be looked upon with eyes full of happiness, if he will ever stop causing pain. **** Several days after meeting Hera outside the grove beside the river, Semele finds herself walking that direction once again. She has not been here since. Instead she has remained in the temple, performing her chores unthinkingly, numbness permeating her every waking moment. But in her dreams she sees all the possible scenarios, all her possible choices. He gave me a choice, she had told Hera. It is time to test that, time to make a choice at last. She calls his name softly into the still air and is rewarded moments later by the sight of him walking towards her through the trees. She stands as he approaches, and he takes her gently in his arms, kissing her softly by way of greeting. Kissing him, it is so easy to forget everything else, to lose herself in the bliss of being loved by a god. But as he begins to slip the sleeve of her dress off her shoulder, she pulls away.\"Wait,\" she says. He stops immediately, stepping back to a chaste distance and dropping his hands. His instant response takes her almost by surprise, but she collects her thoughts, takes a deep breath.\"I met Hera,\" she finally says. He simply nods, but for a moment she glimpses what looks like a flicker of agony in his eyes.\"I know,\" he says. \"Everything she told you is true. As is everything I told you. I am not perfect, Semele - far from it. And I cannot tell you how much I now regret some of what...some of the things she told you about. But I never lied to you. I love you Semele. If you want me to leave, if you never want to see me again...\" he pauses for a moment, but then continues, \"I will understand. But I need you to know that I love you, and I will do anything in my power to make you happy.\" Semele had tried to prepare herself for whatever reply Zeus may give her, but she had not expected this. She struggles against the temptation to throw herself into his arms, struggles to remember what it is that she truly wants.\"Would you show me your true form?\" she asks finally in a whisper. **** It is the last thing he expects her to say, and he is shocked into silence. She is a priestess, she must know the implications of what she is asking. \"Did Hera tell you to ask this?\" \"No,\" she says, a confidence and certainty in her voice that he has never heard before. \"She asked me what I want. As did you.\" \"And what is it you want, Semele?\" he asks, not even trying to hide the shock and pain her request has sparked within him. \"You want to destroy yourself?\" \"No,\" she says once again, still with that strange calm confidence. \"I want you to love me. As you are. As a god.\" \"You know what happens when a mortal looks upon a god,\" he says with something approaching desperation. He has promised her, and he will fulfil his promise at any cost. But he never imagined that cost would be her own life. **** \"Yes,\" Semele replies.\"Are you...are you really asking for death?\" She can hear the pain in his voice. She does not want to hurt him, she is not like Hera, but she cannot back down now. She has spent her life giving in. This, what she plans to be her last request, she will not concede.\"I am mortal, Zeus,\" she says. \"I have to die. All I am requesting is the manner.\"\"Don't do this, Semele,\" he begs. \"Please. You have years left of life, don't throw it away because of something Hera said. She told you to question me, didn't she? She told you I cannot be trusted?\"\"She told me about Leda.\" Semele does not mean for her words to hurt, but Zeus's reaction is as though she has slapped him.\"I...I cannot tell you how much I regret that,\" he says.\"You don't have to,\" Semele tells him softly, \"I believe you. Hera told me not to, you're right. And maybe she was right - she knows far more than I ever will. But I trust you. I am not asking this as evidence of anything.\"\"Then why?\"\"Because you are the only one who has ever given me a choice. And the only one I can trust to fulfil my request.\" **** Through the numbness that has settled over him, Zeus begins to understand. He looks into Semele's eyes, the eyes that first captured his attention, that made him vow to make her smile, whatever the cost. Her eyes full of sadness, of a life of loneliness, a life of silent pain. Life has not been easy to you, he thinks. \"No, it has not,\" Semele answers softly and Zeus realises he has spoken aloud. And then she begins to tell him her story, the story that put the sadness into her eyes. The story of the birth of a daughter who symbolised shame to her parents, the story of a young girl cast out, taken in by a temple because there was nowhere else for her to go. A girl who lost her virginity long before she met Zeus because there was nothing she could do to prevent it. A girl ostracised for her nostalgia when the other priestesses saw it as ungratefulness for the honour of joining the temple. The story of a girl who faded into the shadows, never once addressed as a friend or confident, never once asked what she wanted, never once given a choice. The story of the girl who locked herself away, hid herself deep inside, because what purpose was there of opening herself to the world if the world didn't notice or care. The tears she must have been restraining for years now finally come to the surface as she looks at him, pleading. \"I love you, Semele,\" he says, tears not far from his own eyes, \"I will always love you. Isn't that enough?\" \"I know. And I love you too. These past few weeks have been the best part of my life, Zeus. I want this time, the time I have spent with you, the time I have been loved, to be my last memories. What else is there for me besides growing old in the temple, obedient and devoted and ignored? I want to die here, with the one person who has ever loved me, in the one place I am alive, the one place I am happy. And I want it to be you that I see as I am ferried across the river - you as you truly are. Please, Zeus, at least give me that.\" Zeus knows he has lost. He knows that either way he is going to lose Semele forever - either to his brother Hades or to her own apathy and indifference, for if he does not grant her request he knows he will never see her again. So with fading hope, he plays his last card. \"You're pregnant,\" he says. **** Zeus's words shock through her like a physical blow, sending her thoughts reeling. It is not something she has accounted for, not something she even considered. For several minutes she is speechless, her mind spinning.Semele is ready to accept death, more than ready to depart this life she was never truly meant for in a moment of the happiness she has been denied for so many years. But she cannot possibly condemn an unborn child to the same fate. But this child must be a demigod, she realises. Stronger than an ordinary human. Perhaps strong enough to survive...with Zeus's help.\"Isn't there something you can do?\" she asks, trying to keep the desperation out of her voice. It is a long time before Zeus finally nods. **** \"I can save your child,\" Zeus says, wishing he could give another answer because maybe that would make her pause, make her re-think this choice. But he knows she has already made up her mind. \"Our child,\" she corrects him. \"Our child,\" he agrees, hoping that this child will inherit Semele's eyes - but without the sadness - so she will not be forgotten. \"I'm really going to lose you, aren't I?\" Zeus says finally. \"You would lose me anyway,\" she replies softly, as though she can read his thoughts. \"Please, Zeus. Do this for me. Let me see you as you truly are, let me die knowing I have been loved by a god.\" \"This is really what you want?\" He asks, one last time. \"Yes.\" \"Then I will fulfil my promise.\" It hurts him to even speak the words, but he knows it would hurt him more to deny her request. \"Close your eyes,\" he says, and she obeys. Zeus hesitates for a fraction of a second more, and then begins to shed his mortal form, calling upon the lightning he controls, channelling its energy as he assumes his true form, thunderbolts sparking at his fingertips. From his storm-coloured eyes he looks at the mortal girl he has fallen in love with, the mortal strong enough to withstand the cruelty life handed her, and still to love. Strong enough to face death with open arms. He is not destroying her, he realises suddenly. In granting Semele her last request, he is instead taking a step towards his own redemption. He is not taking her life, but rather giving her the one thing she has been able to request. He is granting her prayers. \"Open your eyes.\" **** She opens her eyes slowly, wondering if she will even get a chance to take in the sight of Zeus in his true form before she bursts into flame.She gasps as she sees him standing there, the raw power of thunderstorms flickering around him, his eyes full of the wild fury of storm clouds and the wisdom and experience of millennia. As she tries to take in this sight, that no living mortal has ever seen, she feels a warmth begin to grow within her, not an instant burst of flame as she had expected but a slow fire spreading through her, fuelled by - or maybe fuelling - a passion stronger than she has known. She steps forward, closing the distance between them once again. There is fire inside her where he embraces her, his lips against hers are like the electric fire of the lightning, but she feels no pain.Her clothing falls away, unable to withstand the fire that begins to lick at her hair, her fingertips. Her exposed skin suddenly feels cold in comparison to the searing heat where Zeus touches her. She presses herself against him, kissing him passionately and wrapping her legs around him to rid herself of the cold, and to feel him against her and inside her in what she knows are her last moments. She feels the liquid fire rushing through her veins, begins to see flames flickering around the edges of her vision, feels her grasp on the physical world slipping. She breaks off the kiss for a moment to look up into the eyes of her lover, and speak her last words.\"I love you,\" she says, smiling up at him as she relinquishes herself to the fire. **** Zeus feels Semele losing her physical form against him and tries to pull her closer, but she is made almost entirely of incorporeal fire. He feels her lips leave his and stares at her in amazement as she speaks her last words, her face glowing with fire and radiant happiness, smiling as the fire in her eyes overcomes the darkness that once filled them. Zeus has known many beautiful women, but none nearly so beautiful as Semele in her last moments, glowing with love and bliss as she gives herself over to the flames that consume her in a final blinding flash of passion. His eyes never leave hers, but in that last instant he fulfils his last promise to her, reaching for the unborn child in her womb, pulling it safely away from the flames that consume its mother. \"I love you too,\" he says, as the light that was Semele fades into the gathering dusk, leaving nothing behind but a hardly-formed infant that Zeus stitches into his leg, and a feeling of blissful peace. **** Eight months later, Zeus looks into the eyes of his son, the eyes he inherited from his mother. And Zeus knows then that this is no ordinary demigod, no almost-human stronger than any mortal, destined to be a hero. Zeus sees in his child's eyes the future of a new god, born of fire and passion, born of a mother who withstood more than any mortal ever could. He sees a god who will one day ignite in others the passionate flames that consumed his mother, that will put fire into the eyes of the mortals he meets. \"Dionysus,\" Zeus whispers.",

    "text": "Prompt - Narnia, Susan, woman is not a word, woman is a sentence. *** Peter and Lucy sometimes think her frivolous, she knows, with her splendid gowns and artfully painted face, her charming laugh and easy tears. They don't realize how glamor can seduce, how charm can be an invitation to confidences, how disarming the outward appearance of a soft heart can be. Secrets are easy to obtain, when you know the tricks; diplomacy, she tells Edmund, is simply a fancy word for manipulation, just as Queen is for woman. Prompt - Narnia, Caspian/Pevensies (and yes I mean all of them), they have a habit of adopting strays *** \"Could someone explain again exactly how this happened?\" Caspian asks, Peter's weight sprawled across his back as he shifts, reaching for the shirt Susan has dangling off one of her feet. He hears Edmund laugh from Susan's other side. \"What is there to explain - Lucy never could bear to see anyone alone, and we've always done everything together; why should you be any different?\" Prompt - Narnia, Edmund, smoking *** \"You don't mind, do you?\" he asks, a rhetorical question as he's already inhaling, feeling his throat sear, stirring up memories of battlefields and blood. \"No,\" Susan says, drowsily, her eyes closed as the sharp smell drifts around them. \"Then at least I know you're still here.\" Prompt - Narnia, Edmund & Susan, it was something that only they could understand *** The others don't understand why she's bitter, why she doesn't want to remember and worship the ideals of hope, but Edmund does. \"You dared to ask him to work against the Deep Magic for me. I've never forgotten that,\" he tells her, and squeezes her hand in passing; some things are concrete, and more important than faith. Prompt - Narnia, Peter/Edmund, AU: Thor!Fusion (as in, Peter is Thor and Edmund is Loki) *** \"Well, that would explain her choice of me,\" Edmund says softly, studying his skin, turned icy blue in patches, every place the frost giant queen had laid her hands on him. Peter's grip on his hammer tightens as he kneels beside his brother, Susan standing firm and tall at his back, keeping watch for them all. \"You know this makes no difference to us. You are ours, and we love you still, as we always have,\" he says, folding Edmund's hand in his own, blue and white entwined. Prompt - The Chronicles of Narnia, Susan, hairpins *** The pretty jeweled ones she wears on state occasions are a collection of Narnia, holding up her crown of hair; metal shaped by centaurs, glittering bits of stones gathered by badgers and cut by dwarves, shells and pearls tossed up from the hands of mermaids, polished wood handed down by dryads. They tell stories, weaving through her hair, tales of where she's been and hints of who she'll see next, the weight of her country carried atop her head. In the end, she finds she prefers her everyday ones; they are plain, practical, and (as she discovers after a night of adventure with Edmund in the Lone Islands that they don't speak of now) excellent lockpicks in a pinch. Prompt - Narnia, Maugrim (& the Secret Police), sometimes they're the good guys. *** He stops outside the den to rub his muzzle in the endless snow, watching with satisfaction as the whiteness darkens with the remnants of faun's blood. He does not regret his work, not one bit. Not when he noses the door open to hear the squeal of his pups, and knows they are safe for another day. Prompt - Chronicles of Narnia/Downton Abbey, Edith & Lucy, stars *** \"The stars are so different here,\" Lucy says, forehead pressed to the car window, looking up into the night. \"I would have loved to have traveled, and seen a different sky,\" Edith says, steering carefully around a bend in the road. \"You still might; you never know where the stars will find you,\" Lucy replies, worlds away. Prompt - Narnia/Downton Abbey, Digory and Polly visit Downton. *** Digory likes Polly's young friend Lady Sybil very much indeed, and Lord and Lady Grantham are really very kind people; even Lady Edith isn't so bad, though Polly is determined to make a project out of her (\"There's an intelligent girl trapped in there, I can just tell,\" she says, speculative). No, it's the oldest sister, Lady Mary, who terrifies him. Her smile might be soft, but she's too regal, too cold, and too beautiful for him to ever be at ease here; the weight of the great house presses down on him every time her dark eyes turn his way, her sharp gaze cutting him like frost. Prompt - The Silmarillion, Daeron, My song has put off her adornments. She has no pride of dress and decoration. *** He does not sing of the beauty of her countenance; the brightness of her eyes or the glory of her hair, for these things are plain fact, not fit for song. He laments her life, instead, the doom that led her to the highest of fates, and brought her beyond the reach of the Eldar. He alone now remembers her as she truly was, without adornment or the wrappings of legend; he remembers the woman, and of her he sings. Prompt - The Silmarillion, Fingon/Maedhros, you can do no wrong / In my eyes *** He dreamed it a thousand times in the endless haze of pain, every word he would say to his cousin, every plea for forgiveness and absolution ready on his lips. When it finally comes, he finds he's not prepared, not only for the sword and the wrenching sharpness, but for Fingon's voice in his ear, a sigh out of a dream, speaking his own words. \"Forgive me, please, forgive.\" Prompt - Firefly, Mal & River, bloody hands *** He knows it ain't right, using her on jobs, no matter how much she tells him she wants to be used; still, it makes them money and keeps his crew safe besides, and those are two things he's never had much of an argument with. Ain't right though, when she walks straight up to him after the job's gone bad, after she's made herself a weapon again for his sake. She never lays a word of blame on him, just takes his hand in hers, leaving him stained red and sticky, blood gathered in the lines of his palm. Prompt - Firefly, Wash, the first time he flew *** He's seen the sky in vids, and spent enough time in the simulators that he's worn a permanent ass-groove in his chosen seat. But it doesn't compare to the first time he breaks atmo, when there's nothing in front of him but the stars, and the freedom to go where the wind takes him. Now that he's up here, he's gonna soar. Prompt - Firefly, any, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones *** \"Shoulda thrown your gorram moonbrained ass off the ship, last planet we were on,\" Jayne grumbles, when he finds River sitting in the midst of every disassembled gun he owns. \"You live in a structure made of glass,\" she tells him, cleaning and slotting pieces into place. \"Serenity ain't made of glass,\" he says, already having forgotten the name of the last planet they'd docked on was Ariel. Prompt - Firefly, River and Wash, she gets a hold of his dinosaurs *** \"Tyrannosaurus Rex couldn't possibly attack a Stegosaurus,\" she tells him, holding his two favorite figures in her little fists, far apart. \"They lived in vastly different eras.\" \"Well, yes, if you want to look at it all scientifically, but-\" he says helplessly, knowing this is the wrong approach just from looking at the way her face is set firm - rather like Zoe's when he's just asked for a footrub he is absolutely not going to get - and then, as luck would have it, inspiration strikes, and he finishes triumphantly, \"-but these are special space dinosaurs; clearly T-Rex would have a time machine,\" and this seems to satisfy her, at least enough for her to continue on with their game, now modified slightly into, 'Giant Lizards Take Over Space and Time.' Prompt - Firefly, Malcolm Reynolds, He's never gonna give you up, he's never gonna let you down, because you're part of his crew *** Family ain't a word that means much to Malcolm Reynolds these days; hasn't really for years now, not since Shadow stopped supporting life under an onslaught of Alliance-issue bombs, his mama being one of those who hadn't made it off in time. So it ain't any notion of family that's got his blood boiling as he peers over a ridge to where some fool idiot with more guns than brains has Wash and Simon and the girls all tied up and held hostage, thinking there's not gonna be a thing he can do about it, cut off from the rest of his people, all on his lonesome. Bad idea, he thinks, sliding down the hill, darting from cover of one rock to another, seeing red behind his eyes as he notices the blood on Kaylee's face, on River's dress and Simon's split lip; he breathes, pulls back the safety on his gun, and rises up like some storm of vengeance in a leather coat, cause that's his crew, gorramit, and ain't nothing in the 'verse more important than them. Prompt - Firefly, Simon/Kaylee, Simon being Simon in front of things is a common theme while Kaylee is Kaylee. And River can be River in the background. *** \"Really, so 'xactly what did you mean then?\" Kaylee says, tapping her foot, the wrench in her hand swinging almost-but-not-quite idly. Simon finds his mouth opening and closing several times before he can manage to come up with, \"Just that it's...you know, good that you're such a great mechanic, because Serenity breaks down so often - not that it breaks down because of you, just-\" \"Yeah, kay, go away now,\" she says, turning her back on him and applying that wrench with a bit more force than he thinks is strictly necessary to some mysterious part of the engine; he sighs and turns to walk away, defeated by his own mouth once more, brushing past his sister's head hanging down from the ceiling as she says, probably not for the last time, \"Such a boob.\" Prompt - Firefly, River, River's feet *** River wiggles her toes over open air, standing at the edge of Serenity's ramp. Under her heels, the metal of the ship, cool and smooth and holding the lives of her crew safe, guarded by a glowing tail; an inch beneath her toes, the grit and dust of a foreign planet, an unknown quantity, alive and made of potential. She lifts one delicate foot, its arch hanging in space, hesitating, reluctant at the last to test the danger in this soil - and then there is a dull thump beside her, her boots deposited in the dirt, and Mal winking at her as he passes, saying, \"Didn't buy those for you just so's you could look at 'em, little one - they'll keep your pretty feet safe.\" Prompt - Hamlet/Firefly, Ophelia and River, Laertes and Simon, \"You're a jerk!\" \"You're a pansy\" \"Holy shit, where did our sisters go?\" *** Simon almost laughs at the irony when Laertes threatens him with a sword (out of all weapons in the 'verse, he picks the one Simon's been trained to use properly?), before he notices the girls are gone, and it's quite possible this is the only thing in all the worlds that could have gotten them to abandon their petty argument and work together. They find them on the banks of the stream, sitting in an oasis of color, River plaiting endless chains of flowers into Ophelia's hair. \"He isn't the boy for you; he talks to the dead and expects a response,\" River says, laughing a bit; Simon sees the dull longing for oblivion in Ophelia's eyes, and for once, his own sister seems a spark of light in comparison. Prompt - Trixie Belden, Brian/Honey, \"Do you think anyone knows?\" *** His face is so serious she almost believes it's a sincere question; he is the best of his siblings at concealing his feelings, after all. But then he cracks, and laughs, and she buries her giggles against his naked shoulder, trying to keep quiet in the dim secret shelter of the old clubhouse. \"With Trixie as your sister, we'll be lucky if there's anyone who doesn't know.\" Prompt - Trixie Belden, Trixie/Jim, the one case she could not solve *** \"Why me?\" Trixie asks, because she isn't like other girls in so many ways (as, for example, her complete lack of subtlety). Jim just laughs quietly, the freckles at the corners of his eyes standing out even in the moonlight. \"How is it that you, of all people, can't figure that out?\" he asks, and kisses her goodnight. Prompt - Trixie Belden, Trixie & Honey, the trouble with brothers *** By the time Trixie finishes her lengthy tale of woe, ending in spectacular fashion with Mart kissing an invisible woman and Brian giving his best imposing-big-brother look before escorting a red-faced Jim from the house, her voice is practically a wail in Honey's ear. \"Honestly, they act like they've never kissed a girl before!\" It doesn't take a detective to see through this case, and Honey laughs helplessly as she tells Trixie, \"But I think that's just it, Trixie - Jim caught Brian and I just last week and did the same thing!\" Prompt - Trixie Belden, Trixie & Mart, almost twins *** \"But Mart, Moms will kill me if I ruin another skirt!\" Trixie said, desperate, hopping up in an effort to see over the solid wood fence in front of them. \"No way. I don't care if we do wear the same size, I am not lending you my pants, and that's final.\" Prompt - the secret garden, mary & dickon, india *** The heat is terrific here, stifling and so full of moisture Dickon fancies he can see it hanging in the air. He understands Mary better now - the Mary who first came to England, sickly and listless, shivering in the Yorkshire chills, that is, because the Mary who's beside him now, looking up at the great grey creature with laughter in her eyes, is a very different girl indeed. \"Come, Dickon, the elephant will not wait all day for us!\" she says, scrambling up to sit high on its back, and as always, his only choice is to take her hand and follow her lead. Prompt - Mad Men, Joan/Roger, maybe this time. *** She learned years ago to never believe a promise made by a man, and Roger is trickier than most. Still, when he looks at her with that glint in his eye and says, \"Come on, Red, it'll be different this time, I promise,\" she might roll her eyes, but she follows his lead anyhow. He's lying and she knows it, but she'll buy what he's selling, when it's the only thing that makes her truly feel alive. Prompt - Mad Men, Pete/Peggy, time past *** She stares at him (and his hand, lingering where it shouldn't be) in disbelief, long enough that it makes him feel like a fool, and he'd almost forgotten how she can do that, and how much he utterly despises it. \"That was a long time ago, Pete,\" she says, and her voice is gentle, just the way he remembers it sounding when she was breathing hot against his ear. Somehow, that only makes it worse. Prompt - Cherry Ames, modern day!Cherry Ames, I always wanted to do this *** Lex was walking across the room in search of his discarded coat and tie when he came to an abrupt halt in front of Cherry and her glowing laptop screen. \"Did you just google me?\" \"Well, if you insist on being so mysterious about your background, I don't see how I'm supposed to find out any other way,\" she said, tucking a curl behind her ear and giving him an unrepentant smile. Prompt - Cherry Ames, modern day!Midge Fortune, Twilight *** \"But Cherry, it's so romantic,\" Midge exclaims, hands clasped to her chest and eyes big as saucers. \"Just like you and your love triangles!\" \"Midge Fortune,\" Cherry says crisply, eying her young friend across the hospital bed they're meant to be making up, \"if you're comparing me to Bella Swan, I'm going to have to beat you with this pillow.\" Prompt - Love Actually, Mark/Peter/Juliet, he's pining for both of them, really; they put an end to it *** One kiss, from just her at that, isn't even close to enough; he should have known it never would be, and after he turns down the third dinner invitation in a row, Peter and Juliet show up unannounced at his door. \"We know it's unforgivably rude,\" Juliet says, sliding in, pulling Peter along with her, \"but we got tired of waiting for you to come round.\" \"Honestly, all you had to do was ask,\" Peter says, and kisses him full on, and suddenly Mark's world is a lot more complete than he ever thought it could be. Prompt - Historical RPF, Octavian/Agrippa, campaigns are tiring *** \"I could never manage without you, you know,\" Octavian says, and his tone is serious because it's always serious, even when he thinks he's joking, but Agrippa's learned to read him well enough to know that this time he's being honest, which is different. They share a look across the tent, across what may as well be acres of dust and maps and creaking leather, and Agrippa knows what people say, that he's won the world for Octavian, given it over like a gift. They don't understand that none of it is a gift; it's a tribute. Prompt - The X-Files, Mulder/+Scully, Dolphin-free tuna *** \"Really?\" she says, hands on her hips like the exasperated mother of a three year old. \"Really, this is what we're focusing on today - dolphin-free tuna fish?\" \"Come on, Scully, do you really believe that our government cares that much for the existence of the noble dolphin, that there isn't some deeper conspiracy at work here?\" Mulder says, the empty can of tuna he'd fed to a stray cat that morning sitting in front of him, its mermaid-printed label taunting him with secrets and codes and visions of aliens in the water. Prompt - Greek mythology, Hades/Persephone/Apollo, I watch you as you go about your life with him *** \"The sun never shines in the Underworld,\" she says, looking up to the sky, her pale skin soaking up the light she's been denied for months, \"so how could you possibly know?\" \"I know,\" Apollo says softly, running his hand up her thigh, brushing aside the fabric of her dress to bring more of her into the living world. \"I watch, and I see how he loves you, how the Underworld makes of you a dark queen,\" he murmurs, his lips against her neck, \"but here you are free, and belong only to the light.\" Prompt - anthropomorphic, spellcheck/grammarcheck, Christmas *** \"Hey baby, looks at what I found,\" Spellcheck says lasciviously, a suggestive red line drawn under 'missletoe'. Grammarcheck looks away in disgust, underlining his no doubt purposefully ungrammatical typo heavily in green despite herself. \"I hate this time of year.\" Prompt - Sherlock, Watson, JAM *** \"Oh lord, look at this, he's left sticky fingerprints all over my medical textbooks, Holmes!\" Watson (original flavor) said, holding out a rather battered book, now slightly pink around the edges. \"Now now, it keeps him very happy, and what is more important, very occupied,\" Holmes said, not bothering to look up from his paper until a shout of, \"By Jove, a clue, a clue in my jam!\" went up from across the room. Original Watson pinched the bridge of his nose, his voice without tone as he told Watson (jam flavor), \"No, you dolt, that is your finger.\"",

      "Prompt - Trixie Belden, Trixie & Honey, the trouble with brothers *** By the time Trixie finishes her lengthy tale of woe, ending in spectacular fashion with Mart kissing an invisible woman and Brian giving his best imposing-big-brother look before escorting a red-faced Jim from the house, her voice is practically a wail in Honey's ear.",
      "\"Honestly, they act like they've never kissed a girl before!\"",
      "It doesn't take a detective to see through this case, and Honey laughs helplessly as she tells Trixie, \"But I think that's just it, Trixie - Jim caught Brian and I just last week and did the same thing!\"",
      "Prompt - Trixie Belden, Trixie & Mart, almost twins *** \"But Mart, Moms will kill me if I ruin another skirt!\"",
      "Trixie said, desperate, hopping up in an effort to see over the solid wood fence in front of them.",
      "\"No way.",
      "I don't care if we do wear the same size, I am not lending you my pants, and that's final.\"",
      "Prompt - the secret garden, mary & dickon, india *** The heat is terrific here, stifling and so full of moisture Dickon fancies he can see it hanging in the air.",
      "He understands Mary better now - the Mary who first came to England, sickly and listless, shivering in the Yorkshire chills, that is, because the Mary who's beside him now, looking up at the great grey creature with laughter in her eyes, is a very different girl indeed.",
      "\"Come, Dickon, the elephant will not wait all day for us!\"",
      "she says, scrambling up to sit high on its back, and as always, his only choice is to take her hand and follow her lead.",
      "Prompt - Mad Men, Joan/Roger, maybe this time.",
      "*",
      "** She learned years ago to never believe a promise made by a man, and Roger is trickier than most.",
      "Still, when he looks at her with that glint in his eye and says, \"Come on, Red, it'll be different this time, I promise,\" she might roll her eyes, but she follows his lead anyhow.",
      "He's lying and she knows it, but she'll buy what he's selling, when it's the only thing that makes her truly feel alive.",
      "Prompt - Mad Men, Pete/Peggy, time past *** She stares at him (and his hand, lingering where it shouldn't be) in disbelief, long enough that it makes him feel like a fool, and he'd almost forgotten how she can do that, and how much he utterly despises it.",
      "\"That was a long time ago, Pete,\" she says, and her voice is gentle, just the way he remembers it sounding when she was breathing hot against his ear.",
      "Somehow, that only makes it worse.",
      "Prompt - Cherry Ames, modern day!Cherry Ames, I always wanted to do this *** Lex was walking across the room in search of his discarded coat and tie when he came to an abrupt halt in front of Cherry and her glowing laptop screen.",
      "\"Did you just google me?\"",
      "\"Well, if you insist on being so mysterious about your background, I don't see how I'm supposed to find out any other way,\" she said, tucking a curl behind her ear and giving him an unrepentant smile.",
      "Prompt - Cherry Ames, modern day!Midge Fortune, Twilight *",
      "** \"But Cherry, it's so romantic,\" Midge exclaims, hands clasped to her chest and eyes big as saucers.",
      "\"Just like you and your love triangles!\"",
      "\"Midge Fortune,\" Cherry says crisply, eying her young friend across the hospital bed they're meant to be making up, \"if you're comparing me to Bella Swan, I'm going to have to beat you with this pillow.\"",
      "Prompt - Love Actually, Mark/Peter/Juliet, he's pining for both of them, really; they put an end to it *** One kiss, from just her at that, isn't even close to enough; he should have known it never would be, and after he turns down the third dinner invitation in a row, Peter and Juliet show up unannounced at his door.",
      "\"We know it's unforgivably rude,\" Juliet says, sliding in, pulling Peter along with her, \"but we got tired of waiting for you to come round.\"",
      "\"Honestly, all you had to do was ask,\" Peter says, and kisses him full on, and suddenly Mark's world is a lot more complete than he ever thought it could be.",
      "Prompt - Historical RPF, Octavian/Agrippa, campaigns are tiring *** \"I could never manage without you, you know,\" Octavian says, and his tone is serious because it's always serious, even when he thinks he's joking, but Agrippa's learned to read him well enough to know that this time he's being honest, which is different.",
      "They share a look across the tent, across what may as well be acres of dust and maps and creaking leather, and Agrippa knows what people say, that he's won the world for Octavian, given it over like a gift.",
      "They don't understand that none of it is a gift; it's a tribute.",
      "Prompt - The X-Files, Mulder/+Scully, Dolphin-free tuna *** \"Really?\" she says, hands on her hips like the exasperated mother of a three year old.",
      "\"Really, this is what we're focusing on today - dolphin-free tuna fish?\"",
      "\"Come on, Scully, do you really believe that our government cares that much for the existence of the noble dolphin, that there isn't some deeper conspiracy at work here?\" Mulder says, the empty can of tuna he'd fed to a stray cat that morning sitting in front of him, its mermaid-printed label taunting him with secrets and codes and visions of aliens in the water.",
      "Prompt - Greek mythology, Hades/Persephone/Apollo, I watch you as you go about your life with him *** \"The sun never shines in the Underworld,\" she says, looking up to the sky, her pale skin soaking up the light she's been denied for months, \"so how could you possibly know?\"",
      "\"I know,\" Apollo says softly, running his hand up her thigh, brushing aside the fabric of her dress to bring more of her into the living world.",
      "\"I watch, and I see how he loves you, how the Underworld makes of you a dark queen,\" he murmurs, his lips against her neck, \"but here you are free, and belong only to the light.\"",
      "Prompt - anthropomorphic, spellcheck/grammarcheck, Christmas *** \"Hey baby, looks at what I found,\" Spellcheck says lasciviously, a suggestive red line drawn under 'missletoe'.",
      "Grammarcheck looks away in disgust, underlining his no doubt purposefully ungrammatical typo heavily in green despite herself.",
      "\"I hate this time of year.\"",
      "Prompt - Sherlock, Watson, JAM *** \"Oh lord, look at this, he's left sticky fingerprints all over my medical textbooks, Holmes!\"",
      "Watson (original flavor) said, holding out a rather battered book, now slightly pink around the edges.",
      "\"Now now, it keeps him very happy, and what is more important, very occupied,\" Holmes said, not bothering to look up from his paper until a shout of, \"By Jove, a clue, a clue in my jam!\"",
      "went up from across the room.",
      "Original Watson pinched the bridge of his nose, his voice without tone as he told Watson (jam flavor), \"No, you dolt, that is your finger.\""

    "text": "When I was twelve years old, I tried to cut off all my hair. My sister, Euanthe, found me before I had entirely succeeded and snatched the shears from my hands. She was afraid that I might hurt myself or ruin my marriage prospects. Little did she understand, I was hoping for both. I have always been considered beautiful, since before I understood what that really meant. It was confusing, as a child, being pointed to in the street, or given gifts by strangers, but not nearly as bad as when I began to mature into womanhood. Men followed me, and their wives hated me for it. The presents were no longer toys or flowers for a girl, but what I can only describe as offerings. As a ten year old, I began to loathe going outside at all, and begged my parents to let me stay inside. At first they thought I was being ridiculous, but when parents began pestering me to bless their babies, my mother took my side, as did my sister. My father, on the other hand, was never one to let opportunity pass him by. At great expense, he brought us to Aetheopeia, where it was well known that their Queen was always in search of handmaidens to complement her beauty. Queen Cassiopeia's delight in my appearance surpassed my father's greatest hopes, and I was assigned to be the companion of her daughter, two years my elder. Had she actually given me time to open my mouth, it might have been a different story. To balance out my good looks, I had cultivated a sour and angry personality. I could not see any advantage in moving to the palace, particularly since as far as I was concerned there was nothing that suggested my beauty would do anything but grow. Would the Queen find me so delightful when I was more beautiful than she? And so it was that I stole a pair of shears from an awestruck gardener and attempted to mangle my hair. \"Psyche,\" my sister said, stroking my head, \"your beauty is a gift from the gods. Why do you hate it so?\" \"I'll pray to the gods that they give it to you instead, and then maybe you'll know,\" I promised. I was extremely religious. Each day, I went before Aphrodite, begging her to make me ugly, and apologizing for the \"worshipers\" I had obtained. Then I went to Hera, and prayed for Euanthe to find a husband who did not want me. Finally I went to Artemis, and prayed to stay chaste, for I hated men for making me feel like a cow at the marketplace, and I loathed my father for using my beauty to further his own name. Now, Cassiopeia's daughter was a patient sort. The first few days I attended her she would ask me questions about myself, and when I responded sullenly or not at all, she would say, \"That's all right, you don't have to tell me.\" Eventually she realized it was better to let me sit in the corner, scowling, than engage with me. Somehow, she never complained, and only ever spoke highly of me to her mother. I can only assume she lied completely, since I assure you, there was never a thing I did for her to be pleased with. But, however silently, I was grateful. Though Aphrodite and Hera were deaf to my prayers (Euanthe did marry, but her husband often tried to get me alone, for what purposes I would rather not dwell on), Artemis seemed to hear me. For all the leering and praise I endured as I grew older, there was not one marriage proposal. Until my seventeenth birthday. My father had gone to the Apollo's Oracle to ask him how I should find a husband, since my state was beginning to edge into embarrassment. Her reply was, as follows, \"Her husband is no wight of human seed, but serpent dire and fierce as might be thought; who flies with wings above in starry skies, and doth subdue each thing with fiery flight- the gods themselves, and powers that seem so wise, even mighty Zeus, be subject to his might.\" My father would have rejoiced, if this had not been accompanied by the instruction to leave me on a cliffside, and the promise that he would never see me again afterwards. For all that she could not have liked me, Andromeda was outraged. \"They cannot do this! It is not marriage the gods prepare her for, but death!\" \"Perhaps death is my fate,\" I said. \"Better that than continue on as a burden to my family.\" Andromeda fell silent at that. Euanthe remained optimistic, however. \"The gods have many forms- perhaps serpent is only one of your husband's! He may be a spirit of the wind who has chosen you.\" Even when we stood at the side of the cliff, no such being in sight, Euanthe congratulated me on my good fortune. \"You are the most beautiful of brides, Psyche,\" her husband said, not sparing his wife a second glance. \"Soon to be the most beautiful of corpses, I'm sure,\" I replied. At that, my mother burst into tears, and my father had to bring her away. The wedding rites between me and empty air were performed with utmost solemnity, and soon it was time to say goodbye. Andromeda embraced me awkwardly, and Euanthe whispered into my ear that I must find a way to send her a letter telling her all about what had become of me. For once, I held my tongue, and simply nodded. I could not bear to bring my sister to tears as well. I must have stood for hours on that cliffside. I contemplated throwing myself over, at one point, but could not work up the courage. Finally, I slept. And that is when this story begins.... I awoke in a garden, a small brook trickling past me. As I squinted at the sunlight, a ladybug crawled over my cheek. \"I have a husband!\" I cried out, truly shocked. And frightened and confused and relieved, all at once. There was no one else to be seen in the garden, but I knew I must have been brought here by someone. Would he throw himself at my feet like others had before him? Would he demand immediate consummation of our marriage? Would he chop me up for supper, or perhaps devour me whole? Would he appear at all, I began to wonder, as I wandered through the garden, and found no sign of my captor. This time, I was determined I would not sleep, but would see the man- or beast- I had been given no choice but to marry. The garden came to an end, and I found a luxurious mansion, with rooms appointed with every luxury one could hope for. Still, I continued to search, and still I found no sign of a husband, or any other being, for that matter. The sun had set long along, and I was wandering through dark rooms with only my hands to guide me, when I collided at last with what felt to be a humanoid figure. \"I'm so sorry,\" were his first words to me. His voice was a low baritone, with a soft edge to it. It did not seem the voice of a serpent feared by Zeus, nor the attitude of one, so I stepped back, and let him speak. \"If I had my choice, we would have met another way,\" my husband continued, sounding genuinely abashed. \"But I'm afraid where I come from there are certain rules that are very strict, and there was no help for it.\" I put my hand on my hip and attempted to stare down the darkness in front of me (for my eyes refused to adjust in this room, no matter how hard I focused). \"What is it you want from me?\" \"What you will,\" he said immediately. \"I promise, marriage is the first and only demand I will ever make of you.\" \"And consummation?\" There was a pause. \"I admit I would like it, but if the prospect frightens or repulses you, I will not pressure you.\" It was too good to be true, I was certain. \"You haven't told me your name.\" \"I am known as the Lord of the Hidden Valley. More than that, I am not permitted to tell you.\" I burst out laughing. \"Must I call you that? That doesn't sound at all husbandly.\" \"It is a bit formal,\" he agreed. \"If there's another name you'd prefer to use, I will answer to any you'll give me.\" \"I can't possibly give you a nickname till I know you better,\" I said finally, after racking my mind. \"I don't even know why you wanted to marry me, since you can't see me any better in the dark than I can see you.\" \"Because I love you. I would love you if I had no eyes, dearest Psyche.\" It was the most staggering thing I had ever heard in my life. How could I possibly respond? How could such a love exist? What had I ever done to merit it? Who in all the world would love me without my beauty? \"How?\" I said, finally. \"Why?\" He laughed, and the sound warmed my ears. \"Shall I give you the long list, or the shortened version? I love you for your spirit, I love you for your courage, I love you for your anger, I love you for your humility, I love the way you stretch your neck when you wake, I love you for the way you hide your tears when you're upset-\" \"How do you know these things about me?\" I burst out, intimidated by his passion. \"You may be a god, but you must have better things to do than follow me around all day! And if you did, why didn't you do something to help me sooner? If Zeus himself fears you-\" \"The Oracle told you that?\" He sounded amused. \"That was something of an evasion on her part. I did all I could do, my darling. If Artemis first heeded your prayers that you not be married, it was I that sent potential suitors elsewhere more recently. You see, I was only sent to you six months ago.\" \"Sent?\" \"Clever Psyche, trying to find hints to my identity,\" he said fondly. \"I cannot tell you by whom or on what errand. All I can say is that I am yours forever.\" \"And if I ask you to leave me?\" I said, tentatively. \"I will go, and not return until you send for me.\" \"And if I never sent for you?\" \"I will be content.\" Something strange was happening to me. I knew nothing of him, truly, and I should have still been afraid and been relieved by his promise to leave me here, but all I could think was how sad it would be never to hear that voice again. Was this what others had felt when they looked at me? \"Go now,\" I managed. And I knew, somehow, that he was truly gone, and not pretending. When I reached my hands out, there was only air, and as I found my way to a bed, I knew it would be empty, and that I could trust him to leave me alone in it. In the morning, I woke full of fear that by sending him away, there would be some catch- that I would be without food, or that the flowers and buildings would begin to crumble. But there was a plate of fresh feta and smoked pork waiting for me, which I tore into eagerly. The rooms were still as glorious as they had been the day before, and there was no sign that anything was amiss. He simply loved me, without any expectation of reward. I realized, with a jolt, that he had given me what I had wanted for so many years. There was no one here to harass me, no one to leer at me, no father to barter me for what goods he needed. Except for the kindness of my sister, and the patience of Andromeda, I had everything I could have needed. And yet, I wanted more. \"Husband,\" I said aloud. The curtains closed themselves. \"Here I am.\" It was day, and I could still see the outlines of my hands, but not him. Perhaps he was invisible. \"May I touch you?\" I said, finally. \"I yearn for it.\" My stomach turned over. \"I know nothing of what passes between men and women,\" I said quickly. \"I will teach you anything you wish to learn.\" How can I begin to describe the bliss I felt in his embrace? There had never been a concrete object of desire for me before- only a sort of abstract longing for warmth. Now, as my husband's hand gently cupped my cheek, and I felt the fine hairs on his chest against my breasts, I understood eroticism. A kind of sympathy was between us; even though I did not believe I could possibly love him yet, I found that I wanted him, and more staggeringly, I <i>liked</i> him. \"Please,\" I whispered.... Since we had occupied ourselves with pleasure in the day, when I woke, it was night, and my invisible lover still lay beside me, legs wrapped around mine. He asked me how I liked the villa, and I told him the rooms I had liked best. He promised to teach me how to play the lyre, and to bring me anything that was lacking. \"I don't know much about love,\" I told him, \"but you are the first man I've ever enjoyed spending time with.\" He took my hand and held it against his mouth so I could feel his smile. \"Thank you.\" This came to be our schedule- early morning to mid-day we slept, then ate and did as we would mid day to late night. He could not always be with me, so on those days I would practise music and explore the grounds. Not that it was all happiness. I missed my sister and mother, and outings to the temples with Andromeda and the other maidens. I wrote them countless letters that I knew would not be sent. And then sometimes I would sit and sift through the little hints my husband had given me as to his identity. I had eliminated a good deal of major gods, as well as satyrs and centaurs. I wondered if he might be one of the spirits of the wind- but that would not explain why he was \"sent\" to me, nor why Zeus would fear him. By his musical aptitude he might have been Apollo, but his shyness and secrecy made that seem unlikely. One night, he was teasing me with a quill, when he must have noticed the ink on my fingernails. \"What have you been writing, love?\" \"Oh,\" I said, embarrassed. \"Letters to my family. My sister wanted me to leave her a note in a hollow tree- but I don't see how I could get to one.\" There was a silence that I had begun to recognize as him thinking. \"I could have Zephyr take the letters- but, well, please don't ask to see your family. At least, not yet.\" \"Why?\" I demanded. I knew I should be grateful, but there seemed something sinister about insisting I be kept away from my sister. \"Don't tell me that's another rule!\" \"Not a rule- just... I'm afraid they might be jealous, and make you unhappy, dearest.\" \"My father and mother usually make me unhappy,\" I admitted. \"But my sister couldn't possibly be jealous of me. Besides, she hasn't even received the letters yet! She may be content to write back and forth.\" \"But you would not be,\" he stated. \"Just allow me one visit from my sister, if she asks.\" He sighed. \"I can't deny you.\"... My sister's letter was ecstatic and stained with tears of joy. She admitted that she had begun to think that perhaps I was dead, but apologized for ever losing hope. (Of course I begun my next letter by telling her she didn't have to apologize for her feelings) She added that she had told our parents, who had told Queen Cassiopeia. This made me uneasy- I had thought my husband's worries of jealousy were silly, but I had figured without the Queen. She was well known for taking umbrage to any good fate that did not favor her daughter (something that deeply embarrassed Andromeda). I told my sister as much, adding that she was free to visit me when she liked, for I would make arrangements with my husband. She replied by explaining that Andromeda had been in mourning, and it had sparked a fight between her and the Queen that Euanthe had hoped to quell. She would be happy to visit me, my sister added, but it was only fair to bring Andromeda. Sheepishly, I explained the situation to my husband. Contrary to what I expected, he was not annoyed, but agreed cheerfully. \"I'll have to be away from you more than usual in the coming weeks, and I don't want you to lack for company.\" I threw my arms around his neck and kissed him fondly. \"I'm so sorry I ever doubted you.\" He held me close, and murmured against my cheek, \"All I ask is that you not let them bring you discontent.\" I didn't understand, at the time, what he meant, so of course, I agreed.... Euanthe and Andromeda were tousled and bedraggled from the wind when they arrived, but in my eyes they could not have been more beautiful. I ran to them, my arms outstretched, and seized my sister in a hug. \"Psyche!\" Euanthe cried, evidently surprised. \"It's so good to see you! And you too, Andromeda,\" I beamed. \"I've never seen you like this before,\" Andromeda marveled. \"What do you mean?\" \"Happy,\" Andromeda said simply. \"Blessings to the gods,\" Euanthe declared. \"For making all of this possible. Now, you must show us around your home, sister.\" I did so gladly, though Andromeda seemed less enamored of the gardens than I, and there was an impatience in Euanthe that I could not figure the source of. \"Here's dinner, if you're hungry,\" I said, after some time, when we came to the room where my husband and I usually supped. \"But who made it?\" Andromeda wondered. \"We've been all over the villa, and not seen a single servant.\" I shrugged, uncomfortably. \"I don't know. I used to think it was my husband, but it comes when he's away, like now, so it must be some other spirit.\" \"He's away!\" cried Euanthe. \"You mean we won't meet him?\" \"No, he's very busy this time of year,\" I tried to explain. \"It's summer,\" Euanthe said suspiciously. \"What could he possibly be busy with, drowning sailors?\" \"Don't be rude,\" Andromeda said quickly, as I gaped at them. \"My husband is not a sea monster,\" I said, shakily. \"But, Psyche,\" Andromeda said gently, \"how could you know for sure? You wrote that you had never seen him.\" \"He has a man's body, I assure you,\" I said hotly, my cheeks burning. \"So why not let you see it? You're married, after all,\" Euanthe pointed out. \"We don't mean to upset you,\" Andromeda insisted. \"It's just- you'll forgive us if all this seems a bit too wonderful to be real.\" And she was right. It wasn't my sister and Andromeda that I was upset at- it was myself. I had wanted to believe so badly, that I pushed the discontent that was already nesting in me to the back of my mind. Hadn't I myself wondered day after day how it was that my husband came upon me, and what the Oracle's words meant? They stayed another two days, and I did my best to be a gracious hostess, but the mood was spoiled. What was I going to do? I could not force him to reveal himself to me. It was Andromeda that came to my rescue. Just before leaving, she pressed a candle in my hand. \"Keep it to yourself,\" she whispered, as she gave me one final embrace. \"When he is sleeping, light it. Unconscious, his true form may be visible to you.\" Euanthe kissed me on the cheek, and sincerely wished me well. \"Please go on writing to us,\" she said. \"I want to share in your happiness, sister.\" But when they were gone, it was Andromeda's words that stayed with me. I stared at the candle in my hand. So drab, so unlike the surroundings. But I knew that it was as real as me. Did I realize I loved him then, when the idea that he might have been deceiving me shook me to my very core? I would sound more intelligent if I did, I'm sure. Instead, I struggled between the need to know, and the desire to trust, spending many a sleepless night wondering when he would return. Then, I thought, I would know what I must do. We had been together long enough that I knew it the moment he entered our bedroom. \"How were your sister and the Princess Andromeda?\" \"Well,\" I lied. \"How was your work?\" \"Much the same as usual- tiresome without you.\" I felt his weight as he sat on the bed and reached for me. I grasped his hand and kissed it. \"Someday, will you be able to tell me what it is you do, at least?\" I asked, trying not to sound petulant. \"I promise.\" We renewed our acquaintance then with much enthusiasm, and afterwards fell to resting. I could tell by his gentle breathing that my husband had fallen asleep, but I stared up at the darkness, remembering the candle. It felt so wrong, but I couldn't explain to myself why. Had I not the right to know my husband's face? He knew my name and history, why didn't I know his? I wanted to find a reason not to look, but ultimately, I could find none more compelling than the sick feeling in my stomach. Slowly, I rolled on my side, and furtively reached under the bed for the candle. Lighting it would be the difficult part- I had found some flint on a day when I had wished to try my hand at cooking my own meals, but I was out of practice when it came to striking fire. After a few surreptitious attempts, during which I stopped repeatedly to make sure the rhythm of my husband's breath continued steady, I finally decided he was not going to awake any time soon, and allowed myself to make more noise in grinding the flint against the steel. Holding the candle between my knees, with the flint directly above the wick, my hands rapidly grew weary of the repetitive motions, but I persisted. I had talked myself into this, and there was no sense in giving up now. At last, the light caught, and I threw down the flint and took up the candle. My first sight was of his wings, folded delicately against his back. How had I never noticed my husband's wings before? Leaning forward, I raised the candle higher so I could look on his face. The moment I beheld it, I was sorry I had ever doubted. \"Eros,\" I whispered, for there was no question in my mind as to my husband's identity now. Words could not possibly do justice to his fine features and well-proportioned body. As he slept on, oblivious, lust rose up in me, and I wanted- needed- to touch him again. You know what happened then, I'm sure. As I leaned forward, all sense of caution forgotten, the candle was melting quickly, not helped by my tightening grip. A large globule of wax slid off the slide, missing my warm fingers, and landing with a light smack! on my husband's shoulder. His eyes flew open immediately, and I, realizing what I had done, shrunk back. \"My mother said this would happen,\" he said, his wings tensing up. \"I didn't want to believe her, but oh! If you had only waited two more nights, I could have revealed myself to you.\" \"Why didn't you tell me that?\" I wailed. He shook his head, tears in his beautiful eyes. \"Not the way it works. I was allowed to take a mortal bride on condition that for six months, she neither see me nor know my name. I agreed, because how else would I know I was loved for my own sake?\" A pang of recognition resonated in my heart. \"I'm so sorry, my love,\" I whispered. \"There must be another way- you must forgive me.\" Eros closed his eyes, and, taking up his quiver of arrows that were now visible to me, spread his wings. \"No!\" I screamed, and seized his leg. He attempted to fly away, but I held on fast, and although my husband had the strength to carry us both, and indeed got as far as the garden, there was little point in flying to escape me when I refused to let go of him. As he landed, I threw my arms around his chest, and covered it with kisses. \"You cannot leave me here, please, I love you. I know now I loved you before I knew-\" \"You've pricked yourself with one of my arrows,\" Eros said flatly. I shook my head. \"I promise you, I never saw them till after. You must forgive me- if it was you in my position, not knowing when you could know all of me, you wouldn't have been able to stand it either. Aphrodite would understand-\" He laughed, bitterly. \"It is because of Aphrodite that I must leave you. She sent me to you last year to curse you, Psyche.\" \"What?\" My stomach turned over. \"What did I do to offend Aphrodite?\" \"First the people of Sicily, then Aetheopeia left off worshiping her in favor of you. She heard your apologies, but it didn't matter- she was still slighted, and she required revenge.\" My eyes burned with tears. \"That's- that's not fair! I prayed every day for my beauty to be taken away!\" \"She sent me,\" Eros continued, as if I had not spoken, \"to cause you to fall in love with some distasteful being. An ass, or the gardener, or the man that cleans King Cepheus' chamberpots.\" \"Only you didn't do it,\" I whispered. He shook his head. \"You may think on that, when I am gone. I can be cruel, as well as kind.\" My husband flew then, too quickly for me to catch hold of again, and though I ran after him, I did not get very far before the agony in my stomach became too much, and I doubled over and emptied its contents beside the river. I was too weak to stand then, so I stayed on my knees, staring at my reflection in the water. For the first time since I had cut my hair as a young girl, I was not beautiful. My eyes were red, and my hair frazzled. Dirt was spread across my body from the harsh landing, and my hands and feet stung with sharp rocks and sticks I had only just begun to feel. I had finally lost my looks, and it did not matter. I was truly alone now, lost without the most beautiful gift I had never asked for.... I can't tell you how long I spent just walking, looking in vain for some hint as to where my husband had gone. Mount Olympus, of course, is where the gods are said to live, but I hoped he was not there now, since I couldn't imagine climbing that mountain on my own, especially since my stomach got worse with each passing morning. I had been thinking of killing myself constantly, even tried to throw myself in the river (which seemed to spit me right out), but on the day I stood at the edge of a cliff, confident that death was indeed my destiny, my stomach ached again, and I absently put my hand to it, only to realize it wasn't my stomach that felt different. \"Oh,\" I whispered. \"Oh, no.\" I was with child, and my husband would never know. My eyes welled up with tears to think of how he would react if he knew. He had said often that he thought fondly of his childhood, and loved to play with children. He would be so happy... \"So,\" a strange, musical voice said. \"You are the beautiful mortal I've heard so much about.\" I turned, slowly, my hand still on my belly, only to stumble and fall to my knees when I saw the goddess who had graced me with her presence. Even at my cleanest, most exquisitely looked after, no one should ever have compared me to Aphrodite. What Eros was to men, Aphrodite was to women. She was all mortal beauty combined and yet beyond mortal beauty altogether. Perhaps because she was a more powerful god than her son, I could not quite look at her directly without becoming dizzy. Instead, I addressed the divine perfection of her toes. \"Great goddess, I have given you praise since I was small-\" \"Liar,\" she said sharply. \"You have rudely demanded I return my gifts since you were small. You have insulted me time and time again.\" \"They brought me unhappiness and unwanted attention, my lady,\" I mumbled. \"True enough,\" she remarked. \"I must admit you did all in your power to dissuade those who would have set you up as a competitor to me. Until now I always thought it was done out of fear.\" \"I loathed it,\" I was quick to assure her. \"I want no other goddesses of love and beauty above you, great lady.\" Judging by her feet, it seemed she preened. \"I believe you. Though I am a jealous goddess, and would rather see you come to some unfortunate end-\" I inhaled sharply \"there is the matter of my son's affection for you. And of course, his unborn child.\" I wondered if she knew because I did, or if she had known from the moment our child was conceived. \"Please, lady, how is Eros?\" \"Still sulking,\" she said dismissively. \"I deliberately set up a bargain that no mortal could keep, but he blames himself and you still. It's really very silly. Unfortunately, when he sulks, his work suffers, which means no lovers, which means no marriages, which means no children, which means no new worshipers. Zeus is extremely displeased, and has demanded I extend the hand of friendship to you, so to speak, and end this.\" \"Oh, thank you!\" I cried out, and was about to kiss her feet, when she held up her hand. \"Before you thank me for my mercy and generosity, there are a few conditions left.\" My heart sank. \"Conditions?\" \"First, you must wash yourself and tend to your body,\" Aphrodite declared. \"I want to see the woman my son fell in love with. Besides, it is an affront to couch in my home without care for one's appearance.\" Thus, I was transported to the home of the goddess of love and beauty, and given such fine materials to cleanse myself that I thought I would never see again. But I did not enjoy the experience, since she stayed and watched me until my hair had finally dried. \"You are a pretty thing, aren't you?\" she said, pinching my cheek. \"A sweet plaything, though even now you grow older and closer to death. If my son had followed instructions, Persephone would surely have had you to attend on her in the underworld.\" \"I am truly nothing compared to you, my lady,\" I murmured. Aphrodite laughed. \"Of course you are. Though...\" she ghosted her hand over my belly \"I must admit, this godling child inside you does lend a certain glow to your features that could make you a fair match for some immortals.\" \"It makes no difference to me,\" I said, fighting the urge to outright say I didn't care who I was more or less beautiful than. \"All I want is to see my husband again.\" \"I'm afraid he's locked himself in his room to tend to the wax burn you gave him,\" Aphrodite said carelessly. \"Oh!\" \"If you are truly sorry for it, you must prove yourself penitent to me.\" I hung my head. \"Please. I'll do anything.\" I will not weary the reader with the strange tasks Aphrodite set for me- separating grains, collecting fleece from Helios' fierce rams, drawing water from the river Styx- since I did none of them myself. I do not know which god was looking after me, but by the time I went to attempt them, they were always finished. Precisely one task assigned did I perform without assistance, and that was my trip to the underworld to retrieve Persephone's beauty remedy. In the underworld, I saw many familiar faces- my mother's parents, who had passed when I was six; a nurse, who had drowned herself for love; my own father, whose death I had not known of. It was well I knew speaking to them would doom me, for otherwise I would surely have tried to draw them into conversation. All in all, by the time I reached Hades' throne, tears were streaming down my face, and I am sure I looked even less flattering than when Aphrodite had found me, with my growing belly and heavily chewed fingernails. \"What's this?\" Hades asked his wife, apparently genuinely confused. \"It doesn't look dead.\" \"It's a living soul,\" Persephone explained. \"Someone must have sent it.\" Hades eyed me with intellectual curiosity. \"I haven't seen a living soul for centuries. What does it want here? There are much easier ways to reach the underworld. Dying, for example.\" \"I'm not an it,\" I said, my voice cracking from disuse. Hades clapped with glee. \"Excellent! It speaks! Who sent you?\" \"Aphrodite,\" I muttered, irritated. \"You must be Psyche,\" Persephone said. \"We've heard of you.\" \"You actually came!\" Hades cried. \"Isn't it wonderful? A living mortal!\" \"She won't be mortal for much longer, dear,\" Persephone said matter of factly. \"What?\" This was the first I had heard of this. \"If you succeed, you'll be turned into a goddess so you can stay with Eros,\" Persephone said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \"If you fail, you'll join us here as a shade.\" \"I hope you fail,\" Hades said bluntly. \"I'm terribly bored with these heroes that are always lurking about. Do have some bread, will you?\" \"I adore them, personally,\" Persephone said. \"But we are boring you. You'll be wanting my beauty remedy.\" She reached under her throne and procured a shining gold box. \"Whether you succeed or fail, do return, won't you? There's still the scent of spring on you.\" I nodded mutely, though I didn't think I liked the ghoulish pair of gods at all. Persephone's beauty was entirely different from Aphrodite's- there was a stillness to her that reminded me of a cat hunting its prey. Hades squeezed his wife's hand. \"Mother's little girl, always. Take care on the way out- we wouldn't want Cerberus to marr that pretty face of yours.\" Considering that he had outright said he hoped I died earlier, I knew this was a threat, and resolved to give Cerberus a wide berth. Fortunately for me, it turned out that the three headed dog loved the bread I had held onto without eating, and was so occupied with fighting itself over a morsel, that I passed by without incident. All the shades I passed on the way out were strangers, and Charon only squinted at me before accepting my coin. I was never so happy to see the sky as I was that morning. Coming out into the daylight, I looked at the box I was holding in my hands. Could this possibly, truly, be my last trial? And if it was, at what cost? What if something of the land of the dead clung to me? I put my hand to my belly, anxious, and was relieved to feel my child kick. Why was it Persephone needed a beauty remedy at all? I had never heard of such a thing for the gods. She could not always have looked as cruel as she did now- perhaps it was living with Hades that drained her of the natural warmth given to a child of spring. I was kneeling, staring at the box now. Some powerful magic must be in it, for Aphrodite to want it. The danger of my trial had passed- all I had to do now was walk back to Aphrodite's house and demand to see my Eros. But I doubted very much he knew I was pregnant- it would be just like Aphrodite to keep such news from him- and my appearance would surely shock him. Psyche, he would say, grief has made you gain weight and you have a weak, servile look about you from obeying my mother's demands. I shuddered, and began to struggle with the clasp of the box. No sooner had I opened it than a rush of cold air flung itself at my face, and knocked me off my feet. The rest I saw from outside my body as if in a dream. Eros, my beloved, flying towards me and gently scooping up my body, tearing death's veil off my face and pressing a kiss first to my forehead, then to my pregnant belly. The box lay forgotten, but it seemed to me that Persephone stepped out from the underworld (was it the end of winter already?) and closed it, then smiled at me, before I opened my eyes and found myself lying in bed with Eros fussing over me like an old maid. His eyes lit up when he realized I was awake, and I can't tell you what it felt like to see him full of joy for the first time. \"Psyche, dearest, can you ever forgive me?\" I touched the newly healed skin on his shoulder where the hot wax had burned him. \"Can you ever forgive me?\" I echoed. \"You're long forgiven,\" he assured me. \"My mother confessed everything. When I found out she had been keeping you here in the same house as me, putting you through ridiculous tests- well, we had a bit of a fight. It's all smoothed over now, though- she was just being overprotective. Zeus is going to make you a goddess, and mother will stay out of our marriage from now on. She means well, I promise you- once you have your own domain to rule over, she'll be far nicer to you.\" I remembered what Persephone had said, and an odd feeling stole over me. \"Will I ever see my family and friends again?\" I said, in a small voice. Eros stroked my hair. \"Love, it'll be easier than ever. You can visit them whenever you like. We shall be equals, you and I. No more secrets, and no more nebulous rules.\" I smiled. \"I like the sound of it. What shall I rule over?\" \"It's been considered very carefully, and you're to be the goddess of the soul. You'll look over mortals' journeys and guide them through hardships. Everyone will speak of what you endured in the name of love.\" \"No one will ever call me Aphrodite again,\" I whispered. \"I think I will like that. I think I will like that very much.\" We kissed, and curled up together, marveling at each other's bodies in the light. \"One thing, beloved,\" I murmured against his ear. \"Anything.\" \"We must find the most wonderful of husbands for Andromeda.\" A mischievous smile spread over Eros' face. \"And the most dashing of lovers for Euanthe?\" I wrapped my legs around him. \"You understand me perfectly.\" There was a small cough, and we turned to see Aphrodite leaning against the wall. \"I believe thanks are in order?\" Baffled, I repeated, \"Thanks?\" \"I am not quite so cruel as I have lead you to believe, little Psyche. It was I that caused my son's hand to slip, and his arrow to fall and pierce his own breast when he saw you.\" My husband's eyes widened. \"You mean you arranged this all along?\" Aphrodite nodded, her matchless eyes twinkling with merriment. \"Though I was honestly irritated by the mortals forsaking me, I had a long conversation with certain other goddesses. You have Hestia to thank for suggesting I solve one problem with the source of another.\" \"Then why the fights and the catty remarks, Mother?\" My husband said, with a trace of irritation. \"Why not let us have our happiness from the beginning?\" \"Because you would have wondered if she loved you for yourself or for your godhood,\" Aphrodite said simply. \"And because she had to prove her worth. Believe me, I've dallied with mortals before. I know how these matters go. You'll thank me when you're older.\" Eros groaned, and shook his head. \"Mother, you know I love you, but please understand when I tell you to go away and give me some time alone with my wife.\" Aphrodite let loose a glorious laugh, tossed her shimmering hair over her shoulder, and obeyed. \"I don't quite forgive her,\" I said slowly, \"but I do understand, in a way.\" I touched my belly, and felt our child kick.",

      "He could not always be with me, so on those days I would practise music and explore the grounds.",
      "Not that it was all happiness.",
      "I missed my sister and mother, and outings to the temples with Andromeda and the other maidens.",
      "I wrote them countless letters that I knew would not be sent.",
      "And then sometimes I would sit and sift through the little hints my husband had given me as to his identity.",
      "I had eliminated a good deal of major gods, as well as satyrs and centaurs.",
      "I wondered if he might be one of the spirits of the wind- but that would not explain why he was \"sent\" to me, nor why Zeus would fear him.",
      "By his musical aptitude he might have been Apollo, but his shyness and secrecy made that seem unlikely.",
      "One night, he was teasing me with a quill, when he must have noticed the ink on my fingernails.",
      "\"What have you been writing, love?\"",
      "\"Oh,\" I said, embarrassed.",
      "\"Letters to my family.",
      "My sister wanted me to leave her a note in a hollow tree- but I don't see how I could get to one.\"",
      "There was a silence that I had begun to recognize as him thinking.",
      "\"I could have Zephyr take the letters- but, well, please don't ask to see your family.",
      "At least, not yet.\"",
      "\"Why?\" I demanded.",
      "I knew I should be grateful, but there seemed something sinister about insisting I be kept away from my sister.",
      "\"Don't tell me that's another rule!\"",
      "\"Not a rule- just...",
      "I'm afraid they might be jealous, and make you unhappy, dearest.\"",
      "\"My father and mother usually make me unhappy,\" I admitted.",
      "\"But my sister couldn't possibly be jealous of me.",
      "Besides, she hasn't even received the letters yet!",
      "She may be content to write back and forth.\"",
      "\"But you would not be,\" he stated.",
      "\"Just allow me one visit from my sister, if she asks.\"",
      "He sighed.",
      "\"I can't deny you.\"...",
      "My sister's letter was ecstatic and stained with tears of joy.",
      "She admitted that she had begun to think that perhaps I was dead, but apologized for ever losing hope.",
      "(Of course I begun my next letter by telling her she didn't have to apologize for her feelings)",
      "She added that she had told our parents, who had told Queen Cassiopeia.",
      "This made me uneasy- I had thought my husband's worries of jealousy were silly, but I had figured without the Queen.",
      "She was well known for taking umbrage to any good fate that did not favor her daughter (something that deeply embarrassed Andromeda).",
      "I told my sister as much, adding that she was free to visit me when she liked, for I would make arrangements with my husband.",
      "She replied by explaining that Andromeda had been in mourning, and it had sparked a fight between her and the Queen that Euanthe had hoped to quell.",
      "She would be happy to visit me, my sister added, but it was only fair to bring Andromeda.",
      "Sheepishly, I explained the situation to my husband.",
      "Contrary to what I expected, he was not annoyed, but agreed cheerfully.",
      "\"I'll have to be away from you more than usual in the coming weeks, and I don't want you to lack for company.\"",
      "I threw my arms around his neck and kissed him fondly.",
      "\"I'm so sorry I ever doubted you.\"",
      "He held me close, and murmured against my cheek, \"All I ask is that you not let them bring you discontent.\"",
      "I didn't understand, at the time, what he meant, so of course, I agreed....",
      "Euanthe and Andromeda were tousled and bedraggled from the wind when they arrived, but in my eyes they could not have been more beautiful.",
      "I ran to them, my arms outstretched, and seized my sister in a hug.",
      "\"Psyche!\"",
      "Euanthe cried, evidently surprised.",
      "\"It's so good to see you!",
      "And you too, Andromeda,\" I beamed.",
      "\"I've never seen you like this before,\" Andromeda marveled.",
      "\"What do you mean?\"",
      "\"Happy,\" Andromeda said simply.",
      "\"Blessings to the gods,\" Euanthe declared.",
      "\"For making all of this possible.",
      "Now, you must show us around your home, sister.\"",
      "I did so gladly, though Andromeda seemed less enamored of the gardens than I, and there was an impatience in Euanthe that I could not figure the source of.",
      "\"Here's dinner, if you're hungry,\" I said, after some time, when we came to the room where my husband and I usually supped.",
      "\"But who made it?\" Andromeda wondered.",
      "\"We've been all over the villa, and not seen a single servant.\"",
      "I shrugged, uncomfortably.",
      "\"I don't know.",
      "I used to think it was my husband, but it comes when he's away, like now, so it must be some other spirit.\"",
      "\"He's away!\"",
      "cried Euanthe.",
      "\"You mean we won't meet him?\"",
      "\"No, he's very busy this time of year,\" I tried to explain.",
      "\"It's summer,\" Euanthe said suspiciously.",
      "\"What could he possibly be busy with, drowning sailors?\" \"Don't be rude,\" Andromeda said quickly, as I gaped at them.",
      "\"My husband is not a sea monster,\" I said, shakily.",
      "\"But, Psyche,\" Andromeda said gently, \"how could you know for sure?",
      "You wrote that you had never seen him.\"",
      "\"He has a man's body, I assure you,\" I said hotly, my cheeks burning.",
      "\"So why not let you see it?",
      "You're married, after all,\" Euanthe pointed out.",
      "\"We don't mean to upset you,\" Andromeda insisted.",
      "\"It's just- you'll forgive us if all this seems a bit too wonderful to be real.\"",
      "And she was right.",
      "It wasn't my sister and Andromeda that I was upset at- it was myself.",
      "I had wanted to believe so badly, that I pushed the discontent that was already nesting in me to the back of my mind.",
      "Hadn't I myself wondered day after day how it was that my husband came upon me, and what the Oracle's words meant?",
      "They stayed another two days, and I did my best to be a gracious hostess, but the mood was spoiled.",
      "What was I going to do?",
      "I could not force him to reveal himself to me.",
      "It was Andromeda that came to my rescue.",
      "Just before leaving, she pressed a candle in my hand.",
      "\"Keep it to yourself,\" she whispered, as she gave me one final embrace.",
      "\"When he is sleeping, light it.",
      "Unconscious, his true form may be visible to you.\"",
      "Euanthe kissed me on the cheek, and sincerely wished me well.",
      "\"Please go on writing to us,\" she said.",
      "\"I want to share in your happiness, sister.\"",
      "But when they were gone, it was Andromeda's words that stayed with me.",
      "I stared at the candle in my hand.",
      "So drab, so unlike the surroundings.",
      "But I knew that it was as real as me.",
      "Did I realize I loved him then, when the idea that he might have been deceiving me shook me to my very core?",
      "I would sound more intelligent if I did, I'm sure.",
      "Instead, I struggled between the need to know, and the desire to trust, spending many a sleepless night wondering when he would return.",
      "Then, I thought, I would know what I must do.",
      "We had been together long enough that I knew it the moment he entered our bedroom.",
      "\"How were your sister and the Princess Andromeda?\"",
      "\"Well,\" I lied.",
      "\"How was your work?\"",
      "\"Much the same as usual- tiresome without you.\"",
      "I felt his weight as he sat on the bed and reached for me.",
      "I grasped his hand and kissed it.",
      "\"Someday, will you be able to tell me what it is you do, at least?\" I asked, trying not to sound petulant.",
      "\"I promise.\"",
      "We renewed our acquaintance then with much enthusiasm, and afterwards fell to resting.",
      "I could tell by his gentle breathing that my husband had fallen asleep, but I stared up at the darkness, remembering the candle.",
      "It felt so wrong, but I couldn't explain to myself why.",
      "Had I not the right to know my husband's face?",
      "He knew my name and history, why didn't I know his?",
      "I wanted to find a reason not to look, but ultimately, I could find none more compelling than the sick feeling in my stomach.",
      "Slowly, I rolled on my side, and furtively reached under the bed for the candle.",
      "Lighting it would be the difficult part- I had found some flint on a day when I had wished to try my hand at cooking my own meals, but I was out of practice when it came to striking fire.",
      "After a few surreptitious attempts, during which I stopped repeatedly to make sure the rhythm of my husband's breath continued steady, I finally decided he was not going to awake any time soon, and allowed myself to make more noise in grinding the flint against the steel.",
      "Holding the candle between my knees, with the flint directly above the wick, my hands rapidly grew weary of the repetitive motions, but I persisted.",
      "I had talked myself into this, and there was no sense in giving up now.",
      "At last, the light caught, and I threw down the flint and took up the candle.",
      "My first sight was of his wings, folded delicately against his back.",
      "How had I never noticed my husband's wings before?",
      "Leaning forward, I raised the candle higher so I could look on his face.",
      "The moment I beheld it, I was sorry I had ever doubted.",
      "\"Eros,\" I whispered, for there was no question in my mind as to my husband's identity now.",
      "Words could not possibly do justice to his fine features and well-proportioned body.",
      "As he slept on, oblivious, lust rose up in me, and I wanted- needed- to touch him again.",
      "You know what happened then, I'm sure.",
      "As I leaned forward, all sense of caution forgotten, the candle was melting quickly, not helped by my tightening grip.",
      "A large globule of wax slid off the slide, missing my warm fingers, and landing with a light smack!",
      "on my husband's shoulder.",
      "His eyes flew open immediately, and I, realizing what I had done, shrunk back.",
      "\"My mother said this would happen,\" he said, his wings tensing up.",
      "\"I didn't want to believe her, but oh!",
      "If you had only waited two more nights, I could have revealed myself to you.\"",
      "\"Why didn't you tell me that?\" I wailed.",
      "He shook his head, tears in his beautiful eyes.",
      "\"Not the way it works.",
      "I was allowed to take a mortal bride on condition that for six months, she neither see me nor know my name.",
      "I agreed, because how else would I know I was loved for my own sake?\"",
      "A pang of recognition resonated in my heart.",
      "\"I'm so sorry, my love,\" I whispered.",
      "\"There must be another way-",
      "you must forgive me.\"",
      "Eros closed his eyes, and, taking up his quiver of arrows that were now visible to me, spread his wings.",
      "\"No!\"",
      "I screamed, and seized his leg.",
      "He attempted to fly away, but I held on fast, and although my husband had the strength to carry us both, and indeed got as far as the garden, there was little point in flying to escape me when I refused to let go of him.",
      "As he landed, I threw my arms around his chest, and covered it with kisses.",
      "\"You cannot leave me here, please, I love you.",
      "I know now I loved you before I knew-\" \"You've pricked yourself with one of my arrows,\" Eros said flatly.",
      "I shook my head.",
      "\"I promise you, I never saw them till after.",
      "You must forgive me- if it was you in my position, not knowing when you could know all of me, you wouldn't have been able to stand it either.",
      "Aphrodite would understand-\" He laughed, bitterly.",
      "\"It is because of Aphrodite that I must leave you.",
      "She sent me to you last year to curse you, Psyche.\"",
      "\"What?\"",
      "My stomach turned over.",
      "\"What did I do to offend Aphrodite?\"",
      "\"First the people of Sicily, then Aetheopeia left off worshiping her in favor of you.",
      "She heard your apologies, but it didn't matter- she was still slighted, and she required revenge.\"",
      "My eyes burned with tears.",
      "\"That's- that's not fair!",
      "I prayed every day for my beauty to be taken away!\"",
      "\"She sent me,\" Eros continued, as if I had not spoken, \"to cause you to fall in love with some distasteful being.",
      "An ass, or the gardener, or the man that cleans King Cepheus' chamberpots.\"",
      "\"Only you didn't do it,\" I whispered.",
      "He shook his head.",
      "\"You may think on that, when I am gone.",
      "I can be cruel, as well as kind.\"",
      "My husband flew then, too quickly for me to catch hold of again, and though I ran after him, I did not get very far before the agony in my stomach became too much, and I doubled over and emptied its contents beside the river.",
      "I was too weak to stand then, so I stayed on my knees, staring at my reflection in the water.",
      "For the first time since I had cut my hair as a young girl, I was not beautiful.",
      "My eyes were red, and my hair frazzled.",
      "Dirt was spread across my body from the harsh landing, and my hands and feet stung with sharp rocks and sticks I had only just begun to feel.",
      "I had finally lost my looks, and it did not matter.",
      "I was truly alone now, lost without the most beautiful gift I had never asked for....",
      "I can't tell you how long I spent just walking, looking in vain for some hint as to where my husband had gone.",
      "Mount Olympus, of course, is where the gods are said to live, but I hoped he was not there now, since I couldn't imagine climbing that mountain on my own, especially since my stomach got worse with each passing morning.",
      "I had been thinking of killing myself constantly, even tried to throw myself in the river (which seemed to spit me right out), but on the day I stood at the edge of a cliff, confident that death was indeed my destiny, my stomach ached again, and I absently put my hand to it, only to realize it wasn't my stomach that felt different.",
      "\"Oh,\" I whispered.",
      "\"Oh, no.\"",
      "I was with child, and my husband would never know.",
      "My eyes welled up with tears to think of how he would react if he knew.",
      "He had said often that he thought fondly of his childhood, and loved to play with children.",
      "He would be so happy...",
      "\"So,\" a strange, musical voice said.",
      "\"You are the beautiful mortal I've heard so much about.\"",
      "I turned, slowly, my hand still on my belly, only to stumble and fall to my knees when I saw the goddess who had graced me with her presence.",
      "Even at my cleanest, most exquisitely looked after, no one should ever have compared me to Aphrodite.",
      "What Eros was to men, Aphrodite was to women.",
      "She was all mortal beauty combined and yet beyond mortal beauty altogether.",
      "Perhaps because she was a more powerful god than her son, I could not quite look at her directly without becoming dizzy.",
      "Instead, I addressed the divine perfection of her toes.",
      "\"Great goddess, I have given you praise since I was small-\" \"Liar,\" she said sharply.",
      "\"You have rudely demanded I return my gifts since you were small.",
      "You have insulted me time and time again.\"",
      "\"They brought me unhappiness and unwanted attention, my lady,\" I mumbled.",
      "\"True enough,\" she remarked.",
      "\"I must admit you did all in your power to dissuade those who would have set you up as a competitor to me.",
      "Until now I always thought it was done out of fear.\"",
      "\"I loathed it,\" I was quick to assure her.",
      "\"I want no other goddesses of love and beauty above you, great lady.\"",
      "Judging by her feet, it seemed she preened.",
      "\"I believe you.",
      "Though I am a jealous goddess, and would rather see you come to some unfortunate end-\" I inhaled sharply \"there is the matter of my son's affection for you.",
      "And of course, his unborn child.\"",
      "I wondered if she knew because I did, or if she had known from the moment our child was conceived.",
      "\"Please, lady, how is Eros?\"",
      "\"Still sulking,\" she said dismissively.",
      "\"I deliberately set up a bargain that no mortal could keep, but he blames himself and you still.",
      "It's really very silly.",
      "Unfortunately, when he sulks, his work suffers, which means no lovers, which means no marriages, which means no children, which means no new worshipers.",
      "Zeus is extremely displeased, and has demanded I extend the hand of friendship to you, so to speak, and end this.\"",
      "\"Oh, thank you!\"",
      "I cried out, and was about to kiss her feet, when she held up her hand.",
      "\"Before you thank me for my mercy and generosity, there are a few conditions left.\"",
      "My heart sank.",
      "\"Conditions?\"",
      "\"First, you must wash yourself and tend to your body,\" Aphrodite declared.",
      "\"I want to see the woman my son fell in love with.",
      "Besides, it is an affront to couch in my home without care for one's appearance.\"",
      "Thus, I was transported to the home of the goddess of love and beauty, and given such fine materials to cleanse myself that I thought I would never see again.",
      "But I did not enjoy the experience, since she stayed and watched me until my hair had finally dried.",
      "\"You are a pretty thing, aren't you?\" she said, pinching my cheek.",
      "\"A sweet plaything, though even now you grow older and closer to death.",
      "If my son had followed instructions, Persephone would surely have had you to attend on her in the underworld.\"",
      "\"I am truly nothing compared to you, my lady,\" I murmured.",
      "Aphrodite laughed.",
      "\"Of course you are.",
      "Though...\" she ghosted her hand over my belly \"I must admit, this godling child inside you does lend a certain glow to your features that could make you a fair match for some immortals.\"",
      "\"It makes no difference to me,\" I said, fighting the urge to outright say I didn't care who I was more or less beautiful than.",
      "\"All I want is to see my husband again.\"",
      "\"I'm afraid he's locked himself in his room to tend to the wax burn you gave him,\" Aphrodite said carelessly.",
      "\"Oh!\"",
      "\"If you are truly sorry for it, you must prove yourself penitent to me.\"",
      "I hung my head.",
      "\"Please.",
      "I'll do anything.\"",
      "I will not weary the reader with the strange tasks Aphrodite set for me- separating grains, collecting fleece from Helios' fierce rams, drawing water from the river Styx- since I did none of them myself.",
      "I do not know which god was looking after me, but by the time I went to attempt them, they were always finished.",
      "Precisely one task assigned did I perform without assistance, and that was my trip to the underworld to retrieve Persephone's beauty remedy.",
      "In the underworld, I saw many familiar faces- my mother's parents, who had passed when I was six; a nurse, who had drowned herself for love; my own father, whose death I had not known of.",
      "It was well I knew speaking to them would doom me, for otherwise I would surely have tried to draw them into conversation.",
      "All in all, by the time I reached Hades' throne, tears were streaming down my face, and I am sure I looked even less flattering than when Aphrodite had found me, with my growing belly and heavily chewed fingernails.",
      "\"What's this?\" Hades asked his wife, apparently genuinely confused.",
      "\"It doesn't look dead.\"",
      "\"It's a living soul,\" Persephone explained.",
      "\"Someone must have sent it.\"",
      "Hades eyed me with intellectual curiosity.",
      "\"I haven't seen a living soul for centuries.",
      "What does it want here?",
      "There are much easier ways to reach the underworld.",
      "Dying, for example.\"",
      "\"I'm not an it,\" I said, my voice cracking from disuse.",
      "Hades clapped with glee.",
      "\"Excellent!",
      "It speaks!",
      "Who sent you?\"",
      "\"Aphrodite,\" I muttered, irritated.",
      "\"You must be Psyche,\" Persephone said.",
      "\"We've heard of you.\"",
      "\"You actually came!\"",
      "Hades cried.",
      "\"Isn't it wonderful?",
      "A living mortal!\"",
      "\"She won't be mortal for much longer, dear,\" Persephone said matter of factly.",
      "\"What?\"",
      "This was the first I had heard of this.",
      "\"If you succeed, you'll be turned into a goddess so you can stay with Eros,\" Persephone said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.",
      "\"If you fail, you'll join us here as a shade.\"",
      "\"I hope you fail,\" Hades said bluntly.",
      "\"I'm terribly bored with these heroes that are always lurking about.",
      "Do have some bread, will you?\"",
      "\"I adore them, personally,\" Persephone said.",
      "\"But we are boring you.",
      "You'll be wanting my beauty remedy.\"",
      "She reached under her throne and procured a shining gold box.",
      "\"Whether you succeed or fail, do return, won't you?",
      "There's still the scent of spring on you.\"",
      "I nodded mutely, though I didn't think I liked the ghoulish pair of gods at all.",
      "Persephone's beauty was entirely different from Aphrodite's- there was a stillness to her that reminded me of a cat hunting its prey.",
      "Hades squeezed his wife's hand.",
      "\"Mother's little girl, always.",
      "Take care on the way out- we wouldn't want Cerberus to marr that pretty face of yours.\"",
      "Considering that he had outright said he hoped I died earlier, I knew this was a threat, and resolved to give Cerberus a wide berth.",
      "Fortunately for me, it turned out that the three headed dog loved the bread I had held onto without eating, and was so occupied with fighting itself over a morsel, that I passed by without incident.",
      "All the shades I passed on the way out were strangers, and Charon only squinted at me before accepting my coin.",
      "I was never so happy to see the sky as I was that morning.",
      "Coming out into the daylight, I looked at the box I was holding in my hands.",
      "Could this possibly, truly, be my last trial?",
      "And if it was, at what cost?",
      "What if something of the land of the dead clung to me?",
      "I put my hand to my belly, anxious, and was relieved to feel my child kick.",
      "Why was it Persephone needed a beauty remedy at all?",
      "I had never heard of such a thing for the gods.",
      "She could not always have looked as cruel as she did now- perhaps it was living with Hades that drained her of the natural warmth given to a child of spring.",
      "I was kneeling, staring at the box now.",
      "Some powerful magic must be in it, for Aphrodite to want it.",
      "The danger of my trial had passed- all I had to do now was walk back to Aphrodite's house and demand to see my Eros.",
      "But I doubted very much he knew I was pregnant- it would be just like Aphrodite to keep such news from him-",
      "and my appearance would surely shock him.",
      "Psyche, he would say, grief has made you gain weight and you have a weak, servile look about you from obeying my mother's demands.",
      "I shuddered, and began to struggle with the clasp of the box.",
      "No sooner had I opened it than a rush of cold air flung itself at my face, and knocked me off my feet.",
      "The rest I saw from outside my body as if in a dream.",
      "Eros, my beloved, flying towards me and gently scooping up my body, tearing death's veil off my face and pressing a kiss first to my forehead, then to my pregnant belly.",
      "The box lay forgotten, but it seemed to me that Persephone stepped out from the underworld (was it the end of winter already?) and closed it, then smiled at me, before I opened my eyes and found myself lying in bed with Eros fussing over me like an old maid.",
      "His eyes lit up when he realized I was awake, and I can't tell you what it felt like to see him full of joy for the first time.",
      "\"Psyche, dearest, can you ever forgive me?\" I touched the newly healed skin on his shoulder where the hot wax had burned him.",
      "\"Can you ever forgive me?\" I echoed.",
      "\"You're long forgiven,\" he assured me.",
      "\"My mother confessed everything.",
      "When I found out she had been keeping you here in the same house as me, putting you through ridiculous tests- well, we had a bit of a fight.",
      "It's all smoothed over now, though- she was just being overprotective.",
      "Zeus is going to make you a goddess, and mother will stay out of our marriage from now on.",
      "She means well, I promise you- once you have your own domain to rule over, she'll be far nicer to you.\"",
      "I remembered what Persephone had said, and an odd feeling stole over me.",
      "\"Will I ever see my family and friends again?\" I said, in a small voice.",
      "Eros stroked my hair.",
      "\"Love, it'll be easier than ever.",
      "You can visit them whenever you like.",
      "We shall be equals, you and I. No more secrets, and no more nebulous rules.\"",
      "I smiled.",
      "\"I like the sound of it.",
      "What shall I rule over?\"",
      "\"It's been considered very carefully, and you're to be the goddess of the soul.",
      "You'll look over mortals' journeys and guide them through hardships.",
      "Everyone will speak of what you endured in the name of love.\"",

    "text": "\"I thought he was meant to be a fat little guy always sitting on his ass.\" \"An ass,\" Ari tutted. \"An ass. Like a donkey. He rode on a donkey. And besides, that was the Roman version, Bacchus. They turned him into a big, indolent lush. Like a jester.\" She motioned toward the statue they were both regarding, gesticulating with a waving hand. \"This was the Greek vision. This is Dionysus in all his grandeur.\" Steffie pulled a face. \"He's a bit... feminine, isn't he?\" Ari rolled her eyes and made another disgusted sound with her tongue. She thought the figure intriguing, sensual and oddly enthralling--slender with a narrow waist and prominent grooves where his hip bones led into his loins, his long but clearly lush hair pulled back into a plait but draped over his shoulder; his chest was flat, defined by trim but sinewy planes, and his face... oh, that face! The hairs up and down her arms prickled and rose on end, as if she'd been electrified. \"I don't think we're even supposed to be in here,\" Steffie noted, grimacing exaggeratedly and beginning to slink off. It was true: They had stepped over velvet rope partitions to get into the small and empty room. Ari had, at the time, put it down to sheer curiosity; Steffie had spied a statue of a satyr having his way with a woman and had thought all of it naughty and titillating--that is, until she'd seen that it was just another bunch of ancient marble statuary and her short attention span was no longer held. The room was overwhelmed with the smell of fresh paint; the walls were covered with a mural depicting a forest, and Ari guessed that the collection had yet to make its debut as a new part of the museum's collection. She wrenched her eyes away from the likeness of Dionysus for a moment and saw the brown polyester clad elbow of a security guard at the corner of one of the three arches; he was turned away, paying them no attention. Steffie was sneaking out in the opposite direction. Ari was riveted to the spot, wholly unable to move her feet, even to shift them; her friend didn't even notice that she wasn't following. Ari thought she heard the sound of gay laughter and her head flew to her right. There was a display of three statues: the satyr in the throes of coitus that Steffie had first glimpsed, another of three woman holding hands and dancing, and the last of a satyr playing his pipes. There room was silent, the sounds of the museum beyond strangely muted, and Ari saw no probable origin for the sound. Her stare returned to Dionysus. She felt a thrill when it seemed as if the blank marble eyes of the statue had shifted to meet her own. This was ridiculous. She should go find Steffie, have something to eat in the cafeteria and get gone. But when at last she felt her feet shuffling against the granite floor, she realized she was moving closer toward the sculpture, her breath catching in her throat. She gazed up at him adoringly, and felt first one leg lift and climb over the velvet rope and then the other, as if she were in some sort of trance, under the sway of the beautiful god towering before her. She tucked her long, brunette hair behind her ear and knelt at the base of the statue, spreading her hands beside her knees. \"What are you doing to me?\" she murmured, and that unnerving laughter sounded again; this time, it seemed to be coming from all around her. \"Ariadne,\" a voice whispered huskily. Her real name, her full name. No one called her by that name; her friends didn't even know it. Her breath caught in her throat, and she swallowed hard, the dry click loud in the otherwise silent room. She edged closer and placed her hands on his legs, right above the backs of his knees; she ran her fingers up the smooth marble, feeling the astounding detail of the carving; every muscle and tendon appeared to have been carefully rendered. She caressed his thighs, admiring the differences between the ligament in the leg he was leaning on and the other that was more or less at rest. And then, gathering her courage, her eyes finally alighted on that which she was craving: his cock was flaccid, resting casually above his bulbous testicles. \"For you, my god,\" she breathed and, pushing herself up on her knees, admiring the way the cool marble was veined, as if there were blood just beneath that pale skin, she closed her eyes and took him into her mouth, extending first her tongue to touch the tip before swallowing him up with her lips. The stone tasted very faintly of dust and some sort of cleaner. She paid it no mind as she pushed her mouth rhythmically along his limp length. Moaning, grasping his firm backside with one hand, she increased her pace hungrily. At first she thought it only her imagination that the stone was becoming warm; her own mouth was warm, after all, hot as a matter of fact, dripping with saliva and she was bound to affect it. But she could not ignore the fact that the cock was growing, both in length and girth. She heard the slight crack and crumble of stone, and her eyes flew open as a hand touched her hair, stroking it. She met his eyes, no longer empty but dark and tender and wild, his face now tilted downward. The surface of the marble was glowing--no! It was gaining color! A soft peach at first and then a deeper tan. His glossy black hair fell from his shoulder, rigidly at first, and then as luxurious as she had imagined it. His cock swelled, filling her mouth; she could feel the bulbous tip cresting from the fold of his foreskin and then bulging past it like a precious, ripe fruit--a plum. It bumped the back of her throat and continued to enlarge; his fingers curled in her hair, trapping her there and making clear his intentions, his desires. 'Yes, my god,' she thought, and then added, 'yes, yes, my husband.' Bracing herself, she opened her throat, compelled her muscles to relax and, with one struggling gulp, she drew him as far as he could go, stopping only when her nose bumped the smooth skin of his groin and her lips wetly wrapped around his shaft's thick root. He smiled down at her, the gesture filled with love and lust, as she held him like that for as long as she could and then withdrew. She repeated this again, and then again. She was adventurous the fourth time and, when he was fully nestled in her throat, her tongue snaked from between his shaft and her bottom lip to lap at his bloated balls. He hissed in surprised delight and threw his head back, and she was rapturously blissful for having pleased him so. She suckled his cock's burgeoning head as her hand pumped him and she caught her breath. She drew him in again, and now she could feel that he was very near to reaching ecstatic fulfillment. His body jerked, and she tried to turn away but the strong hand in her hair prevented her keeping him between her lips as his hips bucked one final time and a burst of hot cum filled her mouth, dripped onto her tongue. She grimaced, trying to pull away, but he held her fast and fed her another mouthful. Her eyes widened in surprise and met his, twinkling with amusement, as she tasted it, not bitter at all but sweet, like grapes, like cream. 'Ambrosia?' she wondered. Did the gods cum ambrosia? Who was she to question anything anymore. She swallowed as much as he could, but he spent five times and it was just far too much. She dropped to hands and knees as the excess came gushing from her lips. She felt soft grass beneath her and when she looked around, the museum, any and all traces of it, were gone. She was in a forest, a stream burbling merrily past. The other statuary was alive as well, creeping around her in cautious but eager inquisitiveness. It never once occurred to her that this was not absolutely and utterly real. \"Ariadne,\" Dionysus said again--and she now knew it was his low, mellifluous voice--and when she peered up at him, he was offering her his hand. She slid her fingers into his and he gently pulled her to her feet. She glanced around at the others, still watching with fervent anticipation. \"Behold! Ariadne--my wife and your Queen!\" A cheer broke out and the joyous sound of music filled the air as the creatures began to dance and fornicate. Dionysus retreated to an ivy-covered throne of made up of entwined twigs and roots covered in a plush leopard pelt; a panther slunk around his feet and settled beside him, purring contentedly and rolling onto its side. Again he gestured to him and she came obediently. When she was standing before him, he placed a hand on her hip and grinned. It was then he seemed to notice her dress, a plain sort of thing, purple with a flared skirt that fell to her calves. He tilted his head this way and that, his brow furrowing deeply as he examined her until she understood what it was he wanted. She laughed gaily. \"It's not exactly a chiton, is it?\" She reached behind her and grappled with the zipper until it was far enough down that she could slide the dress over her round hips; it gathered at her ankles in a pool. He looked arrogantly satisfied for a moment until he became aware of her undergarments, and his frown deepened. \"Wait a moment, Mr. Greedy!\" she teased and reached around first to unclasp her bra. She felt several pairs of rapacious eyes on her as her large breasts tumbled out and she discarded the piece of cloth held stiff by underwire. Her cheeks were flushing, especially when Dionysus appraised her with his eyes and licked his lips appreciatively. Taking a deep breath, she pulled down her panties, giving the satyrs behind her quite the view as she bent over to pull them over her feet. \"You have a strange way of speaking,\" he noted as he gathered her into his arms and pulled him down into his lap. He was hard again, which hardly seemed like a great surprise, considering who he was; she had a feeling he spent most of his time with a thundering erection. He brushed her hair from her face with the back of his hand as his fingertips caressed her cheek and jaw. She sighed and leaned into the touch, her eyes fluttering closed; she wriggled in his lap, spreading a fresh wetness from her pussy onto his hairless thigh. \"But it matters not, for I have spent centuries in search of you.\" \"I am yours, my love,\" she responded, her own hand resting against his taut stomach. \"And so let us now revel!\" he announced, and the cheer was louder than ever. He produced a goblet of wine and fed her sips of it until her lips were stained a dark red. And then he stole kisses, giving her a taste of the heady wine and then drinking it from her mouth, again and again, his hand curled possessively around her throat. The satyrs copulated noisily and vigorously with the maenads, the wild women, all around them. \"Here!\" he beckoned to one, and bowing on his bent legs, the creature approached. \"If my wife will allow it, let her take her pleasure and allow me to watch.\" Ari's eyebrows flew up but she nodded slowly and was drawn onto the grass at the foot of the throne. She kept her eyes locked with Dionysus' as she lay on her back and the satyr cupped her breasts, squeezing their abundance and watching as the pale flesh bulged from between his grasping fingers. He licked her nipples, and then suckled her as if he expected wine to flow from them--who knew? Perhaps it would, should she stay here long enough. The satyr urged her onto her side and she followed, her smoldering gaze fastened to her husband's. The satyr lifted one of her legs and she felt his woolly head nestle between her soft thighs She moaned as his hot tongue penetrated her, running wetly first along the length of her slit, to the puckered hole in her bottom, and then wiggling inside her pussy, lips plucking at the petals of her labia. And then the clever tip of his tongue found the swollen, sensitive nub of her clitoris and began to flick it rapidly. She grasped at the grass, gasping aloud. Sensation exploded along her nerve endings like firecrackers. He dipped his tongue into her, taking a deep draught, before returning his attentions to her clit. Time seemed to slow; from moment to moment, she watched it flicker nearly to a halt, only she and her satyr were still moving in real time. She had the most fantastic orgasm she'd ever had in her life, writhing on the ground, every inch of her trembling, and still she watched her husband through the distortion of sweet tears gathering and falling from her eyes. \"Enough!\" Dionysus roared, and the satyr recoiled, bowing once more, but still licking her from his lips with relish. \"Come,\" he told Ari and smiling dreamily, wobbling on unsteady legs, she came to him, straddling his waist so that his stiff cock lay against her belly, poking at the bottom of her sagging bosom. He wasted no time: He lifted her and impaled her upon his eager manhood. She was still glowing with sensation and tenderness from her climax and the feel of him penetrating her nearly drove her mad! She grasped at his shoulders and began to move immediately. He watched her with a smirk on his full mouth, her breasts bouncing up and down, her head thrown back in rapture. His hips matched her rhythm, wild, fierce, savage, bucking up into her; she felt as if he were burying himself deep within her belly. He shifted slightly and repositioned her: grasping her waist tightly, he turned her so that she was now facing away from him; he pressed a hand to her back, just between her shoulder blades, and forced her to bend at the waist. He took her savagely, her breasts dangling and springing up and down energetically. He watched his cock sliding into her beneath her plump rump, pinching at her cheeks. She was wrong: She hadn't imagined, only moments ago when the satyr was attending to her, that she could ever cum harder or more powerfully, but she did now for him, for her love, her husband, her god. The muscles within her silken sheath tightened around him, undulated and milking him until he, too, reached climax and pumped that syrupy seed into her with more force and in greater amounts than even before. The orgy around them reached a frenzied mood at that moment. Dionysus pulled her to him again, her back to his smooth chest, his arms wrapped tightly around her. Her long hair clung to her in sweaty ropes and she was panting, whimpering and grasping for breath. Again he cupped his hand around her throat. \"This is only the beginning, my love,\" he promised in her ear, kissing her there, beneath her jaw where her pulse was thudding. *~*~* \"Ari?\" Steffie called. She's searched everywhere, and eventually her hunt had led her to the abandoned, roped-off room. She peered in and saw the statue of Dionysus lording over his lustful minions, but no Ari. She shrugged and walked away.",

    "text": "The flowers in her hair withers as she draws closer, turning brown and crumbling as if touched by the hand of death himself; the sky is flat and gray save for the chromatic arch of a rainbow, Iris' final farewell. They don't understand, not a one of them: humoring her mother come springtime was like winter inside her heart every year. As she descends, the yellow curls that tumble from her head wilt as the flowers had, fading to a stunning shade of silver, like the glitter atop a fresh snowfall. He waits for her in the garden where first she had sealed her fate. He is dark and wild, swathed in shadows that seem to reach out with tendrils to touch and caress her. His eyes, his eyes are nearly as black as his long hair, his skin as wan as white silk. He stands beneath the pomegranate tree, a clandestine joke between them. He sweeps sweet Persephone into his arms and kisses her, the force and heat of it pushing her head back. She kneels before him; always she is welcomed back into her beloved husband's arms by the act that bound them together at the first. She parts his black robes, and they part with her, like smoke swirling away from the movement of her small, delicate hands. His long cock is already erect, straining upward from a nest of his dark hair, the coarse black hair that covers most of his body. His coleus was swollen, bulging with the seed that united them those years ago. She caresses it gently as she pulls the head atop his member, engorged, round like a ripe plum, between her lips, groaning and smiling as she suckles it. Her small pink tongue licks its way along the velvet flesh of his shaft, feeling the pulse of his sacred blood beneath. Her hand holds him, strokes along his length, as her lips kiss his scrotum, sucking tenderly at the fragile, sensitive skin, lapping at and swallowing up one testicle at a time. His fingers are tangled in her hair, pulling its weight up and off of her back and shoulders holding up but away from himself, so he may watch her a she returns to his cock. The tip is already weeping the translucent tears of his pre-cum. She laps it up before pushing her mouth down on his organ, groaning, the sound reverberating against and exciting his inflamed groin. She opens her throat to him and he glides as fully as he can into her mouth, her lips wrapped around his furry root, her nose tickled by that hair, her tongue lashing out to lick at the place between his manhood and his sac. She pulls back and advances again, her rhythm fast and hard, taking him deep each time, his hips thrusting to meet the tempo of his wife's ravenous feast. He can hold himself back no longer and, with a resounding growl, he pours his seed into her waiting mouth; she takes every drop of it, wasting none. He touches her chin, urges her to her feet with the gentle, light contact. Their mouths tangle again, and he samples his flavor on her tongue as he wraps himself around her, releasing the clasp of her chiton and letting it fall from her voluptuous body. And, you know, he doesn't think he tastes a thing like pomegranate! He can't imagine where that rumor's come from!",

    "text": "On Winter, it was Persephone's job to attend to the soul of the dead. It was her job to guide them to their rightful place on the great kingdom of Hades, her beloved husband. However, the ones she liked the most to receive were the wives of the great heroes - the heroines, if you will. On Persephone's point of view, they were the strongest human beings there could be. Helen had being one of the most interesting souls she ever guided. She was arrogant, but quite honest and lovable. She understood why a war was fought for her. Penelope came to her with advanced age. There were wrinkles on the corners of her eyes as she smiled tenderly to the goddess. \"How is life here?\" she had asked Persephone. \"For you, it'll be quiet and peaceful.\" Her smile got even larger, showing even more the marks of her age. \"I'm glad.\" Also smiling, Persephone took her by the hand. \"Let me show you the way.\" Medea descended all proud and glorious, not even caring to look at the goddess twice. Persephone laughed at the woman's behaviour. Mortals, they had no idea when to stop, had they? Helios had spoiled her too much. \"Your sons await you.\" She informed Medea. Persephone saw a glimpse of fear on the woman's eyes, but it soon vanished. The one she had liked the most, however, was Antigone. The young woman had killed herself, but she reached the Underworld in such a peace of mind that it was stunning, really. \"Can I drink from the Lethe already?\" she asked, filled with hope. Persephone smiled to her, taking Antigone's hands into hers. \"You'll be sent to a different time. A time where mortals no longer believe in us, gods. They honour one single god there. Would you be willing to go there, daughter of Jocasta?\" Antigone nodded. Hugging her, Persephone let her alone by the side of the river. She took a pomegranate from her mother's garden, and absentmindedly sucked on the seeds as she reminisced about these women. \"Are you alright, my daughter?\" Demeter asked, seeing the eyes of the young goddess were focused far away. \"Yes, I'm just anxious for Winter to come.\"",

She recognized it as Aulis, where she'd been as a girl to visit some faceless relatives. Funny, she thought, the wind was oddly stagnant, as if some great being held its mighty breath. On the shore, where bristling sea grass reaches its threshold and gives way to sand, there stood a great golden executioner's block, prepared for sacrifice. It must have been of the tantamount importance, for as she scanned the beach, she met the faces of soldiers, priests, kings, and seers. To her far right she could make out Calchas, the court prophet. A solemn air of equal parts anticipation and cutting remorse hung over the assembly. With the blink of an eye, the crowd had dispersed, ships departed and wind lashing violently across the shore. The golden block now dripped with wine red blood, pooling in an oblong ellipse, caking the sand into a gritty paste. And so she opened her eyes, back into the Mycenaean night with her king and husband snoring beside her, with darling Iphigenia curled safely in her womb. She bolted upright, crying fat, angry tears and breathing hard through the bile in her throat and nose. Blinking hard to dry her eyes, she was received into her husband's arms, clenching her jaw through his inane spousal cooing. Sobs caught in her chest and she could only hold onto her pride for so long until she willingly folded her hot cheek into the curve of Agamemnon's neck. Despite the platitudes he hoped to soothe her with, she insisted in a voice ragged from exasperation, that no, it wasn't going to be alright. Over his light-hearted jests at her maternal concern and his comforting strokes over her curved belly, she nearly shouted that no, it wasn't just a first time mother's nightmare. The whole night Klytemnestra stared at the tiled ceiling and knew with all of her being that her unborn daughter was doomed, even before her first breath.",

    "text": "Andromeda's mother insists on being the one to prepare her for the sacrifice. \"Not necessary,\" Cepheus argues, \"we have handmaidens for that\"--and Andromeda understands that the only way he can bear exchanging his only daughter's life for the well-being of Aethiopia is to behave as though she never meant anything to him at all. But Cassiopeia insists, and in this, as all things, she has her way. Her mother neither apologizes nor offers words of comfort. She finds both signs of weakness. Instead she brushes Andromeda's dark hair into an inky aureole and paints her cheeks with alkanet juice; rims Andromeda's eyes with kohl to protect from the sun and cinches her sacrificial robe tight with the finest belt in their treasury. She stands back then to admire her work. Perversely, Andromeda wants all the more to live up to her expectations, to prove her mother's boast true by being more beautiful than all the Nereids. Even did she manage such a marvel, though, it would change nothing. The gods punish human pride even when it is well-deserved; that much she has learned from the fate of the Princess of Sicily. Cassiopeia nods. \"You'll do,\" she pronounces, and from her skirts she takes a short sword, really not much more than a dagger, and fastens it onto Andromeda's belt. When she sees it, Andromeda makes a sound that could be either a snort of laughter or a sob. \"Mother!\" she chokes. \"Mother, it's only as long as the monster's teeth!\" \"I want you to have a chance,\" is Cassiopeia's mild response. \"I have always wanted you to have a chance.\" Andromeda does not know a great deal about her mother. She knows Cassiopeia was a minor princess, who could do no better than the youngest son of the King of Egypt; and that she persuaded her husband to leave his father's house and rule over Aethiopia with her. Cassiopeia has always been very clear what she wants--it is one of the things Andromeda admires most about her-- and being the youngest of a string of meek daughters-in-law was not it. Small wonder that Cepheus had agreed. Andromeda knows this, too; that Cassiopeia used her pleasing words to win her country prosperity through trade rather than war, and that was why they had renamed the capital Iopeia in her honor. Common parlance soon shortened it to Joppa, of course, but the fact remained: when they spoke of the wonders of Aethiopia's port, they spoke of her mother, and Andromeda had always been proud of that. Cassiopeia had failed her country in only one thing: not bringing forth a son. All Aethiopia had mourned with the King and Queen when no heir was born. But then the Queen's firstborn girl-child drew breath, and Cassiopeia hid a promise in her name: Andromeda, ruler of men. Andromeda received an education worthy of the highest of princes; she could read and write, do the most difficult of sums, and negotiate peace treaties and business contracts and squabbles between her servants with equal ease. Cassiopeia sat her daughter beside her as the Royal Couple received petitioners by day; by night, she recited tales of great kings and queens until Andromeda fell asleep, her mother's voice all but gone by the time she stopped. By the time Fineus's proposal came, Cassiopeia had raised a daughter who would urge that it be accepted, less for any particular affection for the aging King of Tyre himself than for the alliances he would bring. The Queen's face glowed with pride as Andromeda explained her reasoning, and that, if nothing else, made it worthwhile. Years later, living in Argos with the fisherman's adopted son she loves, Andromeda will wonder if Lord Poseidon's final revenge upon her mother was this: one way or another, her daughter had not ascended her throne after all. The boast is all they remember of her mother these days. Not the clear-eyed, careful debates; not the joy that lingered in Joppa throughout Queen Cassiopeia's reign; certainly not the fact that she had a daughter who she loved for more than her beauty. This is where it happened: in Queen Cassiopeia's private chambers, but on a balcony facing the waves, rather than beside the Queen's bronze mirror. The maidservants had already come to light the lamps and air out the blankets but had scattered at the approach of the Queen and her daughter, having served the two long enough to recognize the signs of impending trouble. Cassiopeia had been in a ferocious mood all afternoon. Andromeda knew that, having been at her side when the news came that five ships of the Queen's fleet had sunk in a storm, taking all their merchandise and their captains, good men all, down to the bottom of the sea. The Queen was sipping wine, to calm both the headache she'd developed and her own guilt and grief, and Andromeda trailed behind her, making soothing noises. Cassiopeia drained her cup, looked unhappily at the dregs at the bottom, and, with unexpected violence, threw the cup over the railing and into the sea. \"What gives them the right,\" she hissed, \"to decide the fate of good men? Of my men!\" Andromeda shrugged. \"They are the daughters of the sea. They are born to it.\" \"Are they wiser than we? Nobler than we? More hospitable? Better in any way than that they have the power to destroy my fleet on a whim and I can do nothing in return?\" Andromeda shook her head. There was a question that had no good answer. Instead, she laughed and joked, hoping to bring forth a smile, \"Well, in the absence of anything more useful, at least they are more beautiful!\" Cassiopeia did not smile. Instead she turned her dark eyes to her daughter and said, deliberately, \"Are they? Are they indeed?\" And only then did they notice the sea churning with rage beneath them. Andromeda's guiltiest secret is that to this day, she isn't sure which statement incited the god's wrath: Cassiopeia's taunt or her own foolish jibe. That day is long past. Now Andromeda is standing on a ledge above the harbor, salt already stinging her skin as the priests of the royal houses wrap her wrists with chains. She does not beg them for help; it is not so much a matter of pride as it is practicality. If they had another way, if they were at all inclined to spare her, they would have mentioned it before. Her father approaches her, tears pooling in his eyes, and bends to kiss her farewell. Andromeda coolly instructs his men to lead him away, to keep him far from a view of the harbor at all costs. He is her father, and she loves him and he her. Some things he should not have to see. Her handmaids cluster around her, weeping. Andromeda weeps, as well, and reminds them all of the jewels and clothes she's bequeathed them. A fine dowry, for any of them, and a good investment in a business, for any who choose otherwise. Her parents' vassals come next, talking in oily tones of the princess's courage and her dignity and how generations upon generations will remember her. That, they assure her, is immortality in its own way. Andromeda wants to snarl back that she'd take that glory and exchange it in the blink of an eye for living to see another day, but it's no use. They don't want to understand, after all; to accept her fear is to acknowledge the horror of her fate. Then the people of the city; they are the ones whose visit Andromeda has been dreading the most. They kiss her feet, and thank her, again and again, for choosing to end their suffering, and Andromeda bites her lip and does not point out that if it hadn't been for her and her mother, none of that suffering would have come to pass in the first place. She wouldn't say she deserves this--no one does--but no more does she deserve the reverence she sees in their eyes. She cannot meet their gaze. One by one, they all bid her goodbye and climb the winding path away from the cliffs. In the end, only the Queen is left. Andromeda puts on the regal smile Cassiopeia taught her as a child, and pulls out her dagger to show that she still has it. Cassiopeia approaches, says, \"I have always been proud of you, my Andromeda.\" \"And I of you,\" replies Andromeda. It is all they need to say to each other; but Cassiopeia, instead of following the rest away, presses herself against the rock wall beside Andromeda. Andromeda wriggles in her chains. \"What are you doing? The creature will devour us both!\" This is an end, she thinks wildly; but if it must be, let it only be mine, not the Queen's, not Joppa's, not all Aethiopia's! Cassiopeia's face is serene, and there Andromeda sees her mistake. She is not the Queen of Aethiopia any more, nor even brave, determined Princess Cassiopeia. In this moment, she is Andromeda's mother alone. \"Then let him,\" she says; and with only a very little trepidation, she moves closer to squeeze her daughter's shackled hand.",
    "sentences": [
      "Andromeda's mother insists on being the one to prepare her for the sacrifice.",
      "\"Not necessary,\" Cepheus argues, \"we have handmaidens for that\"--and Andromeda understands that the only way he can bear exchanging his only daughter's life for the well-being of Aethiopia is to behave as though she never meant anything to him at all.",
      "But Cassiopeia insists, and in this, as all things, she has her way.",
      "Her mother neither apologizes nor offers words of comfort.",
      "She finds both signs of weakness.",
      "Instead she brushes Andromeda's dark hair into an inky aureole and paints her cheeks with alkanet juice; rims Andromeda's eyes with kohl to protect from the sun and cinches her sacrificial robe tight with the finest belt in their treasury.",
      "She stands back then to admire her work.",
      "Perversely, Andromeda wants all the more to live up to her expectations, to prove her mother's boast true by being more beautiful than all the Nereids.",
      "Even did she manage such a marvel, though, it would change nothing.",
      "The gods punish human pride even when it is well-deserved; that much she has learned from the fate of the Princess of Sicily.",
      "Cassiopeia nods.",
      "\"You'll do,\" she pronounces, and from her skirts she takes a short sword, really not much more than a dagger, and fastens it onto Andromeda's belt.",
      "When she sees it, Andromeda makes a sound that could be either a snort of laughter or a sob.",
      "\"Mother!\"",
      "she chokes.",
      "\"Mother, it's only as long as the monster's teeth!\"",
      "\"I want you to have a chance,\" is Cassiopeia's mild response.",
      "\"I have always wanted you to have a chance.\"",
      "Andromeda does not know a great deal about her mother.",
      "She knows Cassiopeia was a minor princess, who could do no better than the youngest son of the King of Egypt; and that she persuaded her husband to leave his father's house and rule over Aethiopia with her.",
      "Cassiopeia has always been very clear what she wants--it is one of the things Andromeda admires most about her-- and being the youngest of a string of meek daughters-in-law was not it.",
      "Small wonder that Cepheus had agreed.",
      "Andromeda knows this, too; that Cassiopeia used her pleasing words to win her country prosperity through trade rather than war, and that was why they had renamed the capital Iopeia in her honor.",
      "Common parlance soon shortened it to Joppa, of course, but the fact remained: when they spoke of the wonders of Aethiopia's port, they spoke of her mother, and Andromeda had always been proud of that.",
      "Cassiopeia had failed her country in only one thing: not bringing forth a son.",
      "All Aethiopia had mourned with the King and Queen when no heir was born.",
      "But then the Queen's firstborn girl-child drew breath, and Cassiopeia hid a promise in her name: Andromeda, ruler of men.",
      "Andromeda received an education worthy of the highest of princes; she could read and write, do the most difficult of sums, and negotiate peace treaties and business contracts and squabbles between her servants with equal ease.",
      "Cassiopeia sat her daughter beside her as the Royal Couple received petitioners by day; by night, she recited tales of great kings and queens until Andromeda fell asleep, her mother's voice all but gone by the time she stopped.",
      "By the time Fineus's proposal came, Cassiopeia had raised a daughter who would urge that it be accepted, less for any particular affection for the aging King of Tyre himself than for the alliances he would bring.",
      "The Queen's face glowed with pride as Andromeda explained her reasoning, and that, if nothing else, made it worthwhile.",
      "Years later, living in Argos with the fisherman's adopted son she loves, Andromeda will wonder if Lord Poseidon's final revenge upon her mother was this: one way or another, her daughter had not ascended her throne after all.",
      "The boast is all they remember of her mother these days.",
      "Not the clear-eyed, careful debates; not the joy that lingered in Joppa throughout Queen Cassiopeia's reign; certainly not the fact that she had a daughter who she loved for more than her beauty.",
      "This is where it happened: in Queen Cassiopeia's private chambers, but on a balcony facing the waves, rather than beside the Queen's bronze mirror.",
      "The maidservants had already come to light the lamps and air out the blankets but had scattered at the approach of the Queen and her daughter, having served the two long enough to recognize the signs of impending trouble.",
      "Cassiopeia had been in a ferocious mood all afternoon.",
      "Andromeda knew that, having been at her side when the news came that five ships of the Queen's fleet had sunk in a storm, taking all their merchandise and their captains, good men all, down to the bottom of the sea.",
      "The Queen was sipping wine, to calm both the headache she'd developed and her own guilt and grief, and Andromeda trailed behind her, making soothing noises.",
      "Cassiopeia drained her cup, looked unhappily at the dregs at the bottom, and, with unexpected violence, threw the cup over the railing and into the sea.",
      "\"What gives them the right,\" she hissed, \"to decide the fate of good men?",
      "Of my men!\"",
      "Andromeda shrugged.",
      "\"They are the daughters of the sea.",
      "They are born to it.\"",
      "\"Are they wiser than we?",
      "Nobler than we?",
      "More hospitable?",
      "Better in any way than that they have the power to destroy my fleet on a whim and I can do nothing in return?\" Andromeda shook her head.",
      "There was a question that had no good answer.",
      "Instead, she laughed and joked, hoping to bring forth a smile, \"Well, in the absence of anything more useful, at least they are more beautiful!\"",
      "Cassiopeia did not smile.",
      "Instead she turned her dark eyes to her daughter and said, deliberately, \"Are they?",
      "Are they indeed?\"",
      "And only then did they notice the sea churning with rage beneath them.",
      "Andromeda's guiltiest secret is that to this day, she isn't sure which statement incited the god's wrath: Cassiopeia's taunt or her own foolish jibe.",
      "That day is long past.",
      "Now Andromeda is standing on a ledge above the harbor, salt already stinging her skin as the priests of the royal houses wrap her wrists with chains.",
      "She does not beg them for help; it is not so much a matter of pride as it is practicality.",
      "If they had another way, if they were at all inclined to spare her, they would have mentioned it before.",
      "Her father approaches her, tears pooling in his eyes, and bends to kiss her farewell.",
      "Andromeda coolly instructs his men to lead him away, to keep him far from a view of the harbor at all costs.",
      "He is her father, and she loves him and he her.",
      "Some things he should not have to see.",
      "Her handmaids cluster around her, weeping.",
      "Andromeda weeps, as well, and reminds them all of the jewels and clothes she's bequeathed them.",
      "A fine dowry, for any of them, and a good investment in a business, for any who choose otherwise.",
      "Her parents' vassals come next, talking in oily tones of the princess's courage and her dignity and how generations upon generations will remember her.",
      "That, they assure her, is immortality in its own way.",
      "Andromeda wants to snarl back that she'd take that glory and exchange it in the blink of an eye for living to see another day, but it's no use.",
      "They don't want to understand, after all; to accept her fear is to acknowledge the horror of her fate.",
      "Then the people of the city; they are the ones whose visit Andromeda has been dreading the most.",
      "They kiss her feet, and thank her, again and again, for choosing to end their suffering, and Andromeda bites her lip and does not point out that if it hadn't been for her and her mother, none of that suffering would have come to pass in the first place.",

    "text": "i. Helen rides into Troy with untied hair, scandalous and prophetic. She is what the crowd sees in her: every personified dream, ominous prophecy, divine offspring. Paris dismounts his horse and for a moment she stands there in peaceful Troy, becoming its queen; then he extends a hand which Cassandra knows is gentle but selfish and she disappears in their mirrored image. Next to Cassandra on the ramparts her brother heaves a sigh. She slips her hand into his, relieved that someone who will be believed sees just how much blood Helen trails in her wake. She brings death, Apollo snickers in her ear, his hand closed around her throat, and Cassandra, who is used to it, doesn't scream. * Despite all she sees Cassandra warms to the young queen, because she's silent and prone to illness, not at all the arrogant courtesan Cassandra imagined her to be. Paris visits her when he's not too busy running through the marketplace or riding his beautiful horses, but in the end she's just one of many gifts, and he looks upon her as he does them, with the same fleeting, soon-bored glance. Cassandra brings Helen figs on a silver tray, as the sun dawns red over the horizon. \"We are sisters now,\" she says. \"You are become Helen of Troy, and I was born here: I am this town's daughter and you its queen.\" Helen looks up. She holds her comb out, and Cassandra takes it dutifully, coming to stand beside her. \"I am not a queen,\" Helen says. \"Or if I am, I bring with me the end of my kingdom.\" \"What do you mean?\" Helen's eyes are molten gold - Cassandra remembers the most beautiful woman in the world and understands in the title another poisonous gift. \"Do you not see the truth, Cassandra?\" Cassandra lifts the comb; as she plunges it in Helen's hair she thinks about nightmares, waking up drenched in sweat, screaming silent screams in the stifling night. \"I close my eyes,\" she says. * Even in Troy, where her proprietor favors other games over her, a trail of suitors follows Helen every time she leaves the castle. She wears laurel in her hair, not in a crown but in a bunch behind her ear - Cassandra feels like she's the only one who sees it for what it is, the imperious claim, undisputed queen. \"You should come with me sometime,\" Helen says to her once, disrobing. \"What, outside?\" Helen laughs. \"You are beautiful.\" Curses don't matter to Helen; she's god-chosen, almost divine. She comes closer, twisting a strand of Cassandra's hair around her ring-adorned finger. \"You should come with me,\" she repeats. \"I get lonely.\" Cassandra the foreseer doesn't anticipate the words that come out of her mouth then: \"Yes,\" she says, in the tone of worship that is the only thing she knows, \"I will.\" * And so during the day they walk in the city, dipping their hands into all the fountains, leaning over each other in laughter. Helen leads the chase and Cassandra follows, always follows, except when she brings Helen to the temples. Then they pray side by side: Cassandra to Apollo, her vengeful, vexed benefactor, and Helen to Aphrodite who has made her who she is, damaging goods. Helen's laugh is as beautiful as she is, maybe more; once she climbs on the ramparts, her dress tangling in the leather straps of her sandals, and she opens her arms over the immense sky, says: \"You should live, Cassandra.\" Cassandra reads what she isn't saying in her sad, burning eyes: You should live now - soon life won't look like this at all. * Cassandra is a box for secrets: in the confines of her ribcage they accumulate slowly, like lint, sure to never get out. Privately she thinks that Apollo, when he cursed her, was punishing her for that first and final lie: the dutiful I love you she whispered as he detached his body from hers in the cloaked night. Among her collection of secrets is Hector's all-encompassing love for his wife, and his certainty that he would let his city crumble for her; one of Paris' lovers, a young Spartan prince, that he never quite forgot; Apollo's confessions every time she closes her eyes, the knowledge that the gods, like Paris, are fickle and volatile; and Helen's hatred of Troy. \"Why do you hate your city so much, Helen?\" Cassandra asks on a starless night as Helen slips into bed next to her, her eyelashes fluttering. \"It's not my city. I don't come from here.\" And then, quieter: \"I don't want to be this woman. I don't want to watch Troy burn.\" Of all the things Cassandra could say (you'll develop a taste for fire; you are this woman; rest your head, Helen), she decides on the gentlest one: silence. * \"Helen! Helen --\" There isn't far to go for her: they were entangled just a minute ago, before the machinery of Cassandra's dreams screeched into motion and the soft warmth of her body became the dreaded fire. \"What is it?\" Helen asks, her eyes heavy with sleep. \"It's - there's a horse, and the ships - they're coming, Helen.\" Helen is silent for a moment, her face shielded by darkness, her golden shoulder marred by the red sting of Cassandra's hair. \"Well,\" she says eventually, \"it had to happen, didn't it?\" She reaches a hand to bring Cassandra close; Cassandra submits willingly to the embrace. * The ships come. They're a high tide, white, armored warriors setting siege to the Trojan shores, ransacking the temples, swarming over the land. Helen watches them from the ramparts, her orange dress like a sun, as if to say, come, I am the one you are looking for. ii. Even though she ought to have learnt her lesson by now, Cassandra tries to warn her father: \"Don't trust the sun god,\" she says, and they watch over her with scandalized faces as the whispers rise, the mad girl, it's the mad girl. \"Apollo is on our side,\" Priam tells her as he locks her into her room, his tall, proud shadow swallowing her. \"Don't you know he looks over us?\" \"The gods are fickle,\" Cassandra screams, beating her fists on the wooden door. * After the war starts and Cassandra is let out, freed in the night like a beloved but rabid dog, she sidles up to Helen and watches with her over the blood-tainted dust. \"They are fighting for you, aren't they?\" she asks, filled with something like wonder. Helen shakes her head, exhales a long, deep sigh. \"No, darling,\" she says, resting her hand on Cassandra's hip. \"That war ended a long time ago.\" * Helen, Cassandra understands, isn't the foil of this war: if anything, she's a stitcher of wounds, another unheard herald trying to protect her own. When she stands next to Andromache and Cassandra again her beauty lies and deceits; in truth she's as peaceful as the first and as mad as the second. Their three silhouettes on the ramparts, spelling wife-queen-prophet, are like a string of pearls: sometimes they reach powerless fingers as they see the frame of a loved one fall, slain, and they can't do anything but watch as the armies walk over him and meet again and again in a deafening ring of steel. * Nine years: what it takes for Cassandra to come to hate love, who took her tongue, her brothers, her father, her city, who will take her life. Nine years: what it takes to bring Helen of Troy to her knee, crying for the mercy of death. Nine years: what it takes for the high tide to rise, for the waves to ebb, for the storm to break. * Cassandra, better than anyone else, knows what destiny holds: she doesn't lift her head when a herald walks in the throne room and exclaims, \"Troy burns,\" just like she doesn't meet Helen's eyes as she catches her mouth in a kiss and says that they will meet again. She runs to the temple, forcing herself not to watch her home burn to ashes, and when she gets there, she sinks to her knees. This isn't over, says the vengeful god. Cassandra dries her eyes. \"I know,\" she answers the silence, and lays her head against the ground, waiting.",

    "text": "When Fredrick Diederich went to school for engineering, he dreamt of building rocket ships. He dreamt of puzzles put to him by kings that only he could solve. He dreamt of building and of becoming, of using his creations to become something better than human (such is the hubris of youth). Now he looks at Isaac, sixteen and pure energy and flying, and he sighs; for something in him knows that skateboards are as close as he will ever come to rocket ships. Things happened between university and Isaac, you see, as is their habit: the NASA Goddard Institute rejected his internship application after college, and his treacherous professor pointed towards Schweizer Industrial Engineering. And he took the job at Schweizer Industrial Engineering, and he stayed at the job at Schweizer Industrial Engineering, and he decayed at the job at Schweizer Industrial Engineering. And he met Marnie, with her quick lips and her kind eyebrows; and she loved him, so he married her. And they had Isaac, and she had cancer, and then she died. And Isaac had no mother, and Fredrick had no schematic for raising a child. He was relieved when Isaac found skateboarding; coming home to an empty house, for whatever reason, felt less lonely than coming home to a lonely child. He tried to bond, but at thirteen Isaac was more concerned with the pattern on the underside of his board than the steel alloy of his axels. Fredrick let it be. He would still patch up his son's scrapes, and remind him to wear a helmet, but Isaac existed largely outside of his father, and Fredrick was somewhat relieved for it. When Isaac was nearly fifteen, Fredrick made one more try. Isaac came home one Thursday afternoon, walked right up to his father, and presented to him the two halves of his broken board. 'I need a new one', Isaac said. Frederick, stirred in part by his professional horror at the shoddy board and part by some paternal guilt, saw his chance. 'I will not buy you a new one,' he told his son. 'But we will make you one.' He stole a small sheet of fiberglass from the canoe manufacturing company he was consulting with. He cut it, he heated it and shaped it, and Isaac would look over his should and tell him, 'It needs to be shorter; it curves like /that/; the ends should be more round.' And Fredrick would adjust it accordingly. He bought axels online, measured them against the broken board (He scoffed at the cheap aluminum alloy-- his board would have better); Isaac corrected him when the axels he chose were too heavy; Isaac chose the color of the wheels. When the axels were assembled, their anchoring holes drilled, and all that remained was to screw them in, Fredrick stopped his son. 'What are you going to name it?' he asked. Isaac scoffed. 'It's a skateboard, not a boat.' 'Still,' Fredrick said of their creation, 'it needs a name.' When his son only shrugged, Fredrick picked up a permanent marker off the workbench. In careful, black boxy capital letters, he wrote DAIDALA across the bottom. Isaac, impatient to have the final product, failed to ask the question his father wanted; he got the answer anyway. 'It means 'finely crafted'. It's Greek.' And, with all the patience in the world, he screwed in the axel plates. - Fredrick began to visit the local skate park. It was also an ordinary park, so he was not entirely out of place. For a long time, he thought Isaac hadn't noticed him, which was as he wanted. One day, though, he caught his son's eyes on him, and though they said nothing of it, the acknowledgment was there. Fredrick's reasons for sitting in the skate park each afternoon were not entirely paternal; watching these children soar in impossible trajectories brought back half-petrified memories of dreams of impossible inventions. And watching his son among them, he felt a sort of proxy accomplishment. My boy, he thought. There was a gingerness to all his thoughts of his son, as if Isaac, like his mother, would disappear some day; as if someone so full of life and daring surely could not exist in a cowardly world. Watching him skate, though, brought such satisfaction as to wash away his world of greys and fear. Watching Isaac skate was watching a man with wings; beautifully, impossibly soaring, wheeling in a world he could not hope to touch. And not the sun in the sky could smite him down.",

      "My boy, he thought.",
      "There was a gingerness to all his thoughts of his son, as if Isaac, like his mother, would disappear some day; as if someone so full of life and daring surely could not exist in a cowardly world.",
      "Watching him skate, though, brought such satisfaction as to wash away his world of greys and fear.",
      "Watching Isaac skate was watching a man with wings; beautifully, impossibly soaring, wheeling in a world he could not hope to touch.",
      "And not the sun in the sky could smite him down."

He preferred the company of the foolish mortals than to that of gods; those brilliant gods, shimmering in their glory. He had no place there, the god of wine surrounded by those patrons of the arts, of wisdom, of beauty and war. He didn't belong. And Dionysus knew it. He was reckless, a rogue, a fool, and she was his companion. He took the to earth, money in his pockets and his mind foggy with alcohol. He stumbled back to the small flat each night, a small hand on his back, keeping him upright. They sat together on the bathroom floor, her arms wrapped around him as he wretched in the toilet. She whispered the old language in his ear as he slumped against her, her fingers threading in his dark hair. Later, the bathroom was deserted and they lay together in the bed, their bodies pressed closely together in sleep and the sheets tangled around their legs. At about two a.m., Dionysus awoke and sat by his easel, contenting himself with painting her sleeping form; the gentle smile residing on her face and the blonde hair that tumbled down her back. As the sun broke through the windows, she would rise, stretching and placing her hands on his shoulders, looking over the painting. \"It's lovely,\" she spoke, her voice hazy from sleep. She then pressed a quick kiss to his temple before leaving the bedroom and moving to the kitchen. He could hear her singing lazily as she fixed a simple breakfast. Dionysus let out a low hum, not moving from his seat. He surveyed the painting, the smooth lines of her body and the blue and silver moonlight casting over her peaceful face. The white sheets splayed over her. The small upward curl of her lips. His love, his wife, his Ariadne.",

    "text": "Apollo has forged this beach into a sheet of beaten gold. The sea is wine dark and silken, barely a ripple to be seen. Where sea meets land are my ships. Six of them, long and sleek, a single square rigged mast for each. My ships; what madness was this? Barely seventeen and I own ships, I command men. My father swore an oath. He made a promise to up-hold a woman's choice of husband. Badly done that, foolish and beyond reason, but while he lives our house is bound to it. Sadly or is it gladly, he is old and frail, so it falls to me. The High King would absolve us I think, did he not crave me under his yoke. Men say I am the finest weapon the Gods ever forged. They lust to possess it, me, all but one. Did I not exist; he would be a hero of note. Tall, swift, golden haired and grey eyed like Athena. When we were barely children, he taught me the casting of javelins. A little older and he let me practice on his lyre. It was our secret. He had taught me every one of the 'manly' arts. I think he loved me even then. Almost like a god whispering in his ear, he knew when I was ready for the next thing. My father was distracted. The quarrels of kings and chieftains took most of his attention. Common wisdom served for his skill at parenting. A boy receives his first dagger at age seven, his wooden sword at twelve. By age fourteen he is ready for edged weapons and begins to practice with men. First time I set foot on the practice field, my cast flew like a stooping eagle. The men made much of it. Boys both of us, we hugged our secret close. It was no small thing to turn bloodthirsty revivers into smiling, jostling, school boys. Were we wiser, our excitement would have been tempered with caution. My potential revealed. The courting started in earnest. I had been a pretty child; pretty enough to turn the heads of men who had no liking for boys. Fortunately I was a king's son. Peleus would have the stones off anyone that tried to force me. That was the fortunate part. The unfortunate part: kings make wars. Any prince that tells you 'he has studied how to rule wisely' is a liar. The art of kings is the art of war. My friend is no prince. His father is a land-holder. They owe service in battle; they also owe us a share of their harvest. He knows how to help a ewe in a difficult birth, what herbs reduce painful swelling. He understands that after you harvest corn from a field you plant it to lentils, leaving the poppies to grow and bloom makes a better olive harvest. He knows things, does my friend. That's why he is managing the loading of my ships, the marshalling of my men. Only twenty, older men glower at his authority over them. Though, he has a better call on their respect than do I. He bears it, this misplaced envy, shoulders that burden for me. He is one of the few I dare to spar with; men have died for my over estimating them. I am gifted, the skills of war are like breathing, but so is dance, and music. Such skills are excellent for a prince to have, but the only one my father values is making men die. Blood sickens me, watching the life drain away like an overturned cup. Cruel, wasteful, and this is the best use my father can make of me; sending me to war for a woman that rejected him. My friend was surprised when I came to him, protested when I took him in my mouth. He has learned to accept this part of me too. When he is gentle it is like the arrival of spring time. His breath a fragrant breeze, kisses like the warm rain, and my body the fertile land waiting for seed. He loves me best then. Loves when he can treasure me, opening my centre with his mouth. When I slide down on his shaft to ride, he watches my face. As my hips grind against him, he revels in my joy, flexing muscle, straining sinew and the wheaten sheaf of my long hair damp with sweat. When my eyes roll back showing the thinnest crescent of jewel like turquois. Only then is he convinced he has not broken some sacred trust. Sometimes I need it to be rough. I need him to take his pleasure from me, to force me. It's only then I really feel safe, when he has conquered, when he has taken possession of my flesh. He is like the others that way. What he has won, he will not surrender. He would grieve himself sick if I left him behind, but he would recover. Like it or not he would take a wife and get sons for his father's line. He would be a good father. I should love him better. I will die in this foreign war. My blood will pour out on the sand like spilled wine. It is one thing to be abandoned; it is another to see your beloved hacked to pieces by cruel bronze. It will break him. The songs will be nails driven into his flesh. No year of his life will be spared remembering me or how I died. I am cruel. I go to war so they will make songs of me. I go to be made immortal, his love is not enough and of that I am ashamed. He is coming now sun golden on his hair, sea-soaked chiton clinging to long tan limbs. The fine hair on arms and legs is darkened by water and salt. His muscled chest and trim hips worthy models for any sculptor. My breath quickens as I see the shadow of his root press against the wet linen. Let men make what they wish of my blush, they see only what they choose. The ships are loaded and waiting. I know what he will say. \"Achilles, the tide is turning. If we mean to go, now is the time.\"",

    "text": "The air was hot and dry, and Orestes hadn't gotten out of bed for days. Electra washed his face, stale with fever-sweat, each morning, but still his hair grew matted and unkempt, and his cheeks were rough with stubble when she kissed them. The madness of the Furies was clear in his ravaged eyes. While Orestes turned fretfully in the worn sheets of his bed, Electra paced. She was used to pacing - the stones in her father's palace had grown smooth and worn from the rhythmic tread of her sandals upon them as she had invented plans for her mother's death year after year. Now, though, the leather straps of her sandals were fraying through, and she feared that her unceasing movement might cause them to snap. She did not know when she could buy others, exile as she now was. But would it matter, if the two of them were soon to be sentenced to death? Pylades alone seemed calm. He sat by Orestes' side when Electra did not have the patience for it, coaxing him to eat with them, meager crusts of bread and thin broths. Sometimes he spoke to Orestes in words too soft for Electra to hear. Watching Pylades' unerring tenderness almost grated upon Electra when she saw the way Orestes' eyes looked through them both as though he had gone as blind as the mythical seer Tiresias. What reason had Pylades for such faithful loyalty? From behind Electra, a scream, pitched like the cry of a bird of prey, erupted from Orestes' mouth. She rushed to him then, grasping his sweat-damp hand, as Orestes rambled on, breathless, his voice ragged. \"Their claws, sharp as knives, I can feel them here, in my flesh, oh, and their voices, they cry to me in women's voices, call me cursed, unnatural, mother-killer, matricide, and their voices, their voices are hers -\" Electra wanted to put a hand over Orestes' mouth, to stop the flow of his words, but all she could do was clutch his hand so tightly that she must have hurt him, speaking to him, her voice loud enough to drown his out, \"It's Electra, Orestes, your sister, I'm here now, no one's going to hurt you.\" (Lies, for the gods could and did hurt him, the old curse upon their family hurt him, and she knew all that, should have known it when she laid the matricidal dagger in his hand, but she would say naught to him that was not comfort, and what help was there if that comfort must be lies?) And Orestes exhaled long and soft. She was comforted as he clutched her hand back, in return. \"Oh, Electra, my beautiful sister.\" \"Yes,\" she began to murmur in return, in a sentence that would perhaps have ended, we are together again, no one will ever be able to separate us this time, even if it ends in death for us both, but he was still speaking, his words slurred, his pauses irrational, but with an even tone. \"Pylades, my dearest friend,\" Orestes called, reaching his other hand out as though blind. Of course, loyal Pylades was there immediately, on Orestes' other side, taking the hand his friend so desperately held out. And so Orestes could continue speaking, one hand held by Electra, the other by Pylades. \"You two, my sister and my friend...it would bring me more joy than anything else in the world to see the both of you happy. I can imagine...you both married, uniting us forever.\" Electra looked at Pylades' smooth face, his eyes unwaveringly fixed upon Orestes, and felt a sudden revulsion for the man. Deference to her brother's wishes would be required within the laws of filial piety with which she defended her act of vengeance on her father's behalf. But the thought of marriage to this boy, Orestes' eromenos, was one that elicited nausea. It was Orestes she desired, if she was honest with herself. That body like to her own, the hair like her memory of her father's. Orestes had been gone so long from her that she wanted to link their bodies so closely that nothing would ever separate them. But she would not speak of this desire. Such marriages were for the gods alone, and the history of their family was tangled enough in perversion that she could not let further shame come upon them. She had heard the perversion of her uncle Thyestes, Aegisthus' father, who had mated with his own daughter, and she had felt herself revolted at the thought. Shared blood should separate as well as unite. Pylades took Electra's hand. \"I would,\" he said, \"be most honored.\" Electra felt faint in the heat. Her body had been too long untouched - it was dry, infertile, withered with rage. She had thought she would never marry. All her body had been turned towards the purpose of vengeance, wound up in the tension of its anticipation. And now it was over. Clytemnestra was no more. The anger with which she had sustained herself was now gone, and all that was left to her was the endless task of tending Orestes, who her own urgings had accursed. She did not look at Pylades. \"It will be as you wish,\" she told Orestes. He spoke as though he were on his deathbed, her brother. But if he was, so was she. Their fates were linked, inextricably. She could anticipate no future in which she would live and he would die. The same crime condemned them both. She let go of Pylades' hand. \"This is no time,\" she told them both, \"to speak of such things. Tyndareus comes, Menelaus comes. The council will soon convene. You must gather yourself, Orestes. You must prepare to speak in your own defense.\" He turned away from her. His hand, though damp with sweat, was clammy in her own. \"I know the Furies torment you,\" Electra continued, trying to speak gently, trying to imbue her words with enough force that they could pierce through the haze of his memory. \"You must push them aside. You must think of the present. You must defend yourself. It is the only way we will survive.\" He groaned and turned away form him. She let his hand fall. \"We must do something,\" she told Pylades, \"they will condemn us all to death.\" He looked at her steadily, his eyes bright in the torchlight. She realized how little she really knew of this man, whose assistance with their murder she had accepted based on nothing but Orestes' assurance of his trustworthiness. \"I think,\" he said, \"I may have a plan.\"",

      "Of course, loyal Pylades was there immediately, on Orestes' other side, taking the hand his friend so desperately held out.",
      "And so Orestes could continue speaking, one hand held by Electra, the other by Pylades.",
      "\"You two, my sister and my friend...it would bring me more joy than anything else in the world to see the both of you happy.",
      "I can imagine...you both married, uniting us forever.\"",
      "Electra looked at Pylades' smooth face, his eyes unwaveringly fixed upon Orestes, and felt a sudden revulsion for the man.",
      "Deference to her brother's wishes would be required within the laws of filial piety with which she defended her act of vengeance on her father's behalf.",
      "But the thought of marriage to this boy, Orestes' eromenos, was one that elicited nausea.",
      "It was Orestes she desired, if she was honest with herself.",
      "That body like to her own, the hair like her memory of her father's.",
      "Orestes had been gone so long from her that she wanted to link their bodies so closely that nothing would ever separate them.",
      "But she would not speak of this desire.",
      "Such marriages were for the gods alone, and the history of their family was tangled enough in perversion that she could not let further shame come upon them.",
      "She had heard the perversion of her uncle Thyestes, Aegisthus' father, who had mated with his own daughter, and she had felt herself revolted at the thought.",
      "Shared blood should separate as well as unite.",
      "Pylades took Electra's hand.",
      "\"I would,\" he said, \"be most honored.\"",
      "Electra felt faint in the heat.",
      "Her body had been too long untouched - it was dry, infertile, withered with rage.",
      "She had thought she would never marry.",
      "All her body had been turned towards the purpose of vengeance, wound up in the tension of its anticipation.",
      "And now it was over.",
      "Clytemnestra was no more.",
      "The anger with which she had sustained herself was now gone, and all that was left to her was the endless task of tending Orestes, who her own urgings had accursed.",
      "She did not look at Pylades.",
      "\"It will be as you wish,\" she told Orestes.",
      "He spoke as though he were on his deathbed, her brother.",
      "But if he was, so was she.",
      "Their fates were linked, inextricably.",
      "She could anticipate no future in which she would live and he would die.",
      "The same crime condemned them both.",
      "She let go of Pylades' hand.",
      "\"This is no time,\" she told them both, \"to speak of such things.",
      "Tyndareus comes, Menelaus comes.",
      "The council will soon convene.",
      "You must gather yourself, Orestes.",
      "You must prepare to speak in your own defense.\"",
      "He turned away from her.",
      "His hand, though damp with sweat, was clammy in her own.",
      "\"I know the Furies torment you,\" Electra continued, trying to speak gently, trying to imbue her words with enough force that they could pierce through the haze of his memory.",
      "\"You must push them aside.",
      "You must think of the present.",
      "You must defend yourself.",
      "It is the only way we will survive.\"",
      "He groaned and turned away form him.",
      "She let his hand fall.",
      "\"We must do something,\" she told Pylades, \"they will condemn us all to death.\"",
      "He looked at her steadily, his eyes bright in the torchlight.",
      "She realized how little she really knew of this man, whose assistance with their murder she had accepted based on nothing but Orestes' assurance of his trustworthiness.",
      "\"I think,\" he said, \"I may have a plan.\""

    "text": "The first time Persephone sees her, Artemis has a hand curled around her shoulder in a way that exposes the tunic-covered curve of her breast in a shockingly lovely way, and it takes Persephone a moment to realise that she's reaching back for an arrow. Behind her, the deer, startled by her sudden presence, leaps off into the thicket, splashes through a puddle, startles birds. Escapes death. Artemis' hand lowers slowly. The hard line of her body seems to uncoil. Persephone can't help it that the colours of the world make her eyes ache, and that she feels bewildered by the fact that she can see that Artemis' eyes are blue. Her vision is still streaked with the black of the dead. \"That was the first deer of the season,\" Artemis calls across to her, her voice unfathomable. \"But then I guess you'd know that.\" There is something hard in the words. She turns around and walks away with the light feet of spring. Persephone sees the muscles of her back, and feels strangely upset by them. When she looks up, the first buds of soft-green spring leaf fleck across her vision like they dot the trees. The sky is a careful sort of blue. Waiting. - Her mother says, like only a mother can: \"Don't go out tonight. I only just got you back.\" Demeter likes to brush Persephone's hair in the evenings, and Persephone thinks about age and adulthood in a way that she never did, before. Hades understands, in a way. Regression, he calls it, and he bites down on the word and holds her hand between his fingers, traces prudently the path of her bewildering blood in her wrists. If he could, he'd never let her go, she knows. It doesn't feel like regression when she sits with her mother and feels like a daughter again. It feels like rebirth. Hades' understanding doesn't survive the long and arduous way back up, Persephone finds, and at night, when she braids and re-braids strands of her hair, that scares her. - After a few days, Persephone can no longer resist the call of the woods. Demeter lets her go - she insists on a few days of something that feels like quarantine, when she lets Persephone sit in the doorway and soak up the soft first light of spring without letting her go outside, but after that she concedes. This is Demeter's area of understanding, after all. Persephone touches the bark of the awakening trees on those first nights. They're still mostly bare, but she can feel something speeding up beneath her fingers. The first flowers look feeble but are frost-resistant, and when she touches their small, white heads, closed and bowed against the treachery of early spring, there is the sound of tinkling. Not for the first time, she wonders about winter, and has trouble remembering Hades' face. - \"Well,\" Artemis says as a greeting, and straightens from her reclined position on a sun-spattered moss-covered rock. She's alone; fleetingly Persephone wonders about handmaidens. \"Yes,\" she replies, unable to dig up from her childhood and training the proper way to adress a high goddess of Olympos. Artemis seems to like it, and smiles a smile that reminds Persephone of the white frost-flowers (beautiful, strong, a little sharp). \"Everyone's talking about you these days, you know,\" Artemis says. She's leaning back on her elbows, and when she casts her eyes up to the canopy the long line of her neck is exposed, still pale from the earliness of the season. Persephone feels warmer than she has for - for a long time, though she'd be hard pressed to say how long, just from looking at the way Artemis' throat moves with every swallow of air, and the way her loose hair, the colour of - of ripe grain in deep summer (as the memory returns to Persephone in bursts of colour), brushes over her arms. \"Are they?\" she asks, and feels a pleasant thrill at her own voice. It sounds different in the ceilingless woods, like there is more of her voice. Down below she progressively descends into whispering as the days wear on and she loses track of the concept of days. \"Of course they are,\" Artemis says, then seems unwilling to say more. A long moment passes. A solitary finch trills a few anticipatory notes. \"Can I sit here?\" Persephone asks on an impulse, because very suddenly, she doesn't want to share the woods with only creatures without language. And at home Demeter is still afraid to sing to her, as if she'll shatter at the sound. Artemis studies her. \"Yes,\" she says then, as though having found something that satisfies in Persephone's face. Persephone perches next to her, stiff and unsure. Artemis relaxes back into her reclined pose, and puts her arms above her head. The swell of her breasts against the light fabric of her tunic makes Persephone's heart race, and it's an old, forgotten feeling that rushes back like a warm wave. \"I, for one, am glad you're back,\" Artemis says, eyes closed, face sun-dappled, and Persephone isn't sure who she's talking to. - \"What's it like?\" Persephone asks, when they crouch over the first lily-of-the-valley together, and Artemis doesn't pull back when their thighs touch. \"Winter?\" \"Yes.\" Artemis very gently touches one of the flower heads with her fingertip. It opens further under the ministrations, and Persephone remembers with a sudden rush of exciting shame in whose company she is. \"Cold,\" she says. \"Like forgetting.\" Persephone thinks she understands, and looks at Artemis in a way that she doesn't know how to stop, not even when Artemis looks back, eyes a careful blue, waiting. - \"Where are you off to now?\" Demeter complains, but she's smiling, holding her palms open so the bees can come and dance in them. \"Woods,\" Persephone calls over her shoulder, and feels like a daughter, a woman, free. - In the mornings, the fog dissipates before Persephone has time to wash her face. Demeter is awash with energy, and brings honey from the mountain bees, fresh goat's milk, fresh fragrant thyme, ripened olives oozing oil. At midday, the world steams and has to stop for breath. The sun is a shimmering disk of molten gold - Persephone shades her eyes often and looks up at it, tries to see it for what it is, tries to see the wings and the chariot and the glint of blue that must be there, in the flame, if he looks anything like his sister at all. Artemis catches her at it one time, and pulls her chin down, laughing. \"Apollo doesn't reveal himself that easily,\" she says. Her lips are the colour of the berries they shared. \"Nor do I,\" she adds, as an afterthought. Persephone feels like praying, feels like offering herself up in sacrifice for this uncovering, this blessing. So she does - the only way she can think of: pressing forward and licking the berry from Artemis' lips, and allowing her inside in a way she can't remember if she has ever let anyone before. - \"It's a disgrace,\" Artemis says, silently in the dusk. \"He had no right to take you from this world. It needs you.\" \"He's a god,\" Persephone counters logically. Artemis turns luminous eyes on her, blazing blue. Belatedly, Persephone remembers that Artemis is a goddess, too. \"He takes life,\" she says, unmoved in a way Persephone doesn't recognise. \"He... he keeps people,\" Persephone tries. She knows she needs to defend him, even now, with her hand so lazy on Artemis' knee. \"He guides them on their final journey.\" \"He's a man,\" Artemis says, with a strange kind of bitterness, as though that explains everything. Then, she puts her lips to the hollow of Persephone's collarbone, as if to silence herself. Persephone tries to think of something to say, and fails - and not only because she can't remember what the underworld looks like, except for a darkness, a cloudy absence of light and breath. - \"Is it very different?\" Artemis asks softly, and her fingers trail down over the curve of Persephone's hip, leaving something hot in their wake. Persephone knows what she means, but she can't... even if she tries... Hades wavers in her memory, his face wiped clean, his fingers cold and unmoving. \"I don't remember,\" she finally admits, whispering. Artemis' hand stills, and Persephone curses herself for a moment, because there is nothing she wants apart from Artemis' hand there, and Artemis' breath on her cheek. But Artemis doesn't withdraw; she slides her palm from Persephone's hip to the lowest strip of skin on her belly and leaves it there. \"Good,\" she says, satisfied and a little sad, and radiates heat from every one of the points of her fingers. - \"I thought you never wanted anyone to do this,\" Persephone murmurs, burning with something other than shame, mouthing at the skin of the inside of Artemis' knee. \"Not anyone, no,\" Artemis says breathlessly, and tangles her fingers into Persephone's hair. It feels like prayer, like worship, when Persephone kisses deeper, further, and drinks from that sweetness that is like earth, dark and nourishing. - The shadows lengthen quickly. The wheat is golden and fat in the field. Demeter watches her daughter go with guarded eyes, but Persephone misses it, too busy watching the sky full of birds. - \"I will never marry,\" Artemis states later, tying her tunic with uncharacteristically angry hands. \"I will never lose myself that way.\" Persephone, sated and drowsy, rests her head on her hand. \"I thought you liked... isn't this...?\" Meeting Artemis' stare is harder, sometimes, than trying to pick out the shape of Apollo at noon. Persephone blinks. \"Do you - do you really think this is -\" Artemis fumbles over the words, which restores a shock of consciousness to Persephone, because Artemis doesn't lose her words, ever. \"This is finding myself,\" Artemis says finally, and there is something so broken in the way she looks away, hunches her shoulders. Persephone doesn't understand, traces the tenseness of Artemis' back with a finger, but feels wholly, completely unequipped to say something. She tries, because she has noticed the way Artemis looks up at the sun these days, with wide and pained eyes, as though needing her brother to do something for her: \"I won't forget you.\" Artemis turns to look at her. Everything about her is soft, but Persephone knows she is like the first flowers of spring: so brittle on the surface, so hardened underneath. \"Promise me,\" she says. \"Swear to your goddess.\" \"I swear,\" Persephone says without a trace of uncertainty, and puts her hand on Artemis' neck, where her head connects to it - that place of soft vulnerability. \"I swear. I swear.\" Later, she burns thyme and pigs' bones to seal it, and watches how the smoke crowns Artemis. - Demeter grows old and pained each year when the leaves turn. Persephone washes her mother's feet at dusk, and looks out at the fog trying to climb the trees. It never gets easier, her mother says, as though to herself. - Her mother hugs her when she gets up one day and the sky is still dark, and then Demeter leaves to do something on the fields, shoulders heavy with an unnamed weight. Something in Persephone knows what to do. She waits for Artemis at the cave's mouth, picks up the first leaves that fall, yellow with spots of red. The trees are still full of life. Artemis never comes, and inching forward all the time is the darkness, the cloudy absence of light and breath, welcoming her back. - Hades waits for her, the long way down. Her eyes are not yet adjusted, and blurry with carry-over light and something wet. She can hardly make him out, a dark shape against a darker backdrop, reaching out for her. \"My love,\" he says, voice awash with relief, and somehow, knows not to touch her, not yet. - The first time Persephone sees her, Artemis is sitting cross-legged on a rock, her quiver of arrows next to her. She's taken off her sandals, and her toes shine with dew from where she's walked through the grass. Persephone can't help it that the colours of the world make her eyes ache, and that she feels bewildered by the fact that she can see that Artemis' eyes are blue. Her vision is still streaked with the black of the dead. \"You look like death,\" Artemis calls across to her, her voice unfathomable. \"But then I guess you'd know that.\" She turns, walks away barefoot, her sandals dangling from her fingers. The display of light muscle on her back, set tense and unreadable, upsets something in Persephone. Artemis disappears between the still-barren trees. When she's alone, Persephone looks up on an impulse, and inexplicably feels like crying at the sight of the first buds of soft-green spring leaf, flecking across her dark-dimmed vision like they dot the trees. The sky is a careful sort of blue overhead. Waiting.",

      "Demeter lets her go - she insists on a few days of something that feels like quarantine, when she lets Persephone sit in the doorway and soak up the soft first light of spring without letting her go outside, but after that she concedes.",

      "Persephone feels warmer than she has for - for a long time, though she'd be hard pressed to say how long, just from looking at the way Artemis' throat moves with every swallow of air, and the way her loose hair, the colour of - of ripe grain in deep summer (as the memory returns to Persephone in bursts of colour), brushes over her arms.",
      "\"Are they?\" she asks, and feels a pleasant thrill at her own voice.",

Her bruises are sticky with olive juice as he bends over her head, offering a juicy bite of fig, then the thick implacable pressure of his tongue. For tho he's the ruler of death, he exists to act out this dance of life upon her shivering flesh. The hungry desperation within him frightened her once - now it's simply a part and parcel of their marriage, vitality for a dead man. If she's to have her spring she must first survive this winter of chilled iron skin slammed against her dainty, perfumed length, and the violent kneading of her breast akin to a closed-fist beating. They tangle like a writhing pit of snakes, a confusion of muscle and nerve squirming across the bed. His hair feels like wet seaweed as it slithers through her fingertips and she squeezes the locks between her fingers, searching for permanence. He pulls her backward across the stone tablet by her hair and shoves himself inward, forcing their faces together. Whatever he sees there must please him, for she receives a crooked smile and a nip to her bottom lip. The tempos she follows easily, until he bellows like the condemned he punishes, his fingers clutching her waist and pulling her upward as he heaves and writhes. She feels the familiar chill of his release, and knows he plants his seed whence it shall e're grow, for no life can spring from the dead. Turning from his kiss, she blinds herself to hope and possibility alike. Time reverses. The bubbling black sands swallow her discarded chiton whole. The pomegranate slithers into her belly and lodges there like an uninvited guest.",

    "text": "The adjustment period is, in its own unqualified way, the hardest part. Ariadne still searches the bedchamber for thread and needle to mend her torn chiton to the musical laughter of her husband, who waves his grape-stained hand and mends the fabric in a moment. She blushes to the roots of her hair and never - not in the hundreds of years she dwells upon Olympus - does she recall that she can cure the rent with her own magic. When she asks Psyche during one sun-dappled afternoon how she's learned to adapt herself to the non-rigors of their glamorous new lives, Psyche shrugs her golden shoulder and smiles. \"I have to recall that I must do things for myself. It's a fair switch, after years of being pampered by my village.\" Ariadne's nose wrinkles in amusement. \"How could I forget that? All those years groomed as a sacrifice.\" The most beautiful, sweetest girl in the village, intended as a blood offer to Aphrodite, a walking prayer to the Gods for fruitfulness. She smiles her beautiful smile. \"It's, isn't it?\" Psyche plucks a goblet of wine up from the table before them, drinking deeply of its contents. Ariadne watches her drain the goblet, her eyebrow arching. \"Are you all right?\" Sometimes Ariadne wonders if she is; the standards surrounding her are quite high. \"As well as I can be.\" She plucks up a fig and smiles. \"I have the most patient, darling husband in all the world, and the most gorgeous daughter brought to Olympus since Athena leapt from Zeus' forehead.\" She pats her tresses and scoots deeper into the seat of her golden throne. \"It's so hot today. I think I'm getting a blemish.\" It dawns on Ariadne that Psyche has been trained to expect death, that her deathlike life must seem surreal to her. Most heavens are such, she decides lightly. She spears a fig upon her little finger. \"And you?\" Psyche asks. Ariadne smiles. \"I smell of wine. My diadem makes the stars, and I have given two children to the grape fields.\" She smirks. \"The pits?\" A laugh. \"The pits.\" They toast glasses and close away unpleasant topics. They are immortal, and many days of exploration lie ahead.",

It doesn't worry him anymore the way it did when it was new - the way new things always do, because he isn't used to newness, he is only used to things that have already passed, people that have already gone silent, and he isn't used to feeling unsettled by any of that. He knows by now that yes, she starts looking like a shade when she comes back down from the light, but she doesn't become one, she doesn't die - and she brings with her a warmth that he always forgets about when she leaves. He's asked her, once, when it was still new and she was still scared in the perpetual night of Dis, what it feels like when he touches her, and she had said, then: \"I thought it would be cold, but it isn't,\" and he couldn't explain why that made him shiver, and he had felt like putting his hand along the curve of her skull where her neck begins, and never ever leaving that place again. Letting her go every time, receding from him like a cloud taking a firmer shape with every step away from him, is like shutting a door on a light he never knew he had the eyes for to see. He watches her now. She is here. She sits, pale and translucent but the only thing that lives, and watches the offering of nothingness in her palms, her hair limp and dark around her face. It's the winter solstice, and under her skin, her blood is beating.",

    "text": "Times change and along with them things such as appearances and philosophies evolve. And that goes the same for Mount Olympus. Over time, the Gods' quarters have evolved -- Zeus' area now looks like something fit for an oligarch, Hera's garden is one of ever growing and ever changing delights (this month she's settled for the Pacific Northwest), Ares looks like a cross of a bachelor pad and army barracks and so on and so forth. But the fundamentals remain the same. Hestia knows this as she settles in for another day of tending the home fires and tackling the eternal question: What's for dinner? Over time, her space has evolved from a simple hearth fire to something a bit bigger. Her kitchen is large and roomy and the best way to compare it to something is Julia Child's kitchen. It's not ostentatious, elaborate or even fancy. It's practical. There's a breakfast bar where the other gods tend to flit in and out of grabbing a quick meal or a cup of coffee and exchanging chit chat, the coffee maker that is always brewing coffee and an enormous gas stove always hot, always burning. Today it's Demeter, back from a visit to Peru, paying Hestia a visit. She's bundled up a few presents, including some ceviche that Hestia is enjoying for breakfast. \"You didn't see Persephone off?\" Hestia asks, after finishing up the ceviche and pouring another cup of coffee for Demeter. \"You know she's going to be gone for the winter.\" Demeter shrugs. \"After a millennium of this, you get used to it,\" she says, taking a bit of honey and mixing it with her coffee. \"Liar,\" only Hestia could say that to a goddess, but then again, being a goddess has its own perks. \"You're still mad that she went off and eloped with Hades.\" Demeter smiles bitterly. \"It's not that I don't like him,\" she retorts. \"I mean, we all have our functions, but why couldn't she tell me she wanted to marry him? Why run off like that? I thought we were close and she could tell me anything.\" Hestia shrugs and pulls out a cutting board and a knife off of the magnet strip on the wall. \"Who knows? Maybe you were wrong.\" Picking some herbs out of a pot, she begins to do a chiffonade cut. \"Obviously,\" Demeter sips her coffee. \"It just still stings,\" she sighs. \"Once trust is broken, you can't get it completely fixed. It just makes me wonder what else she's hiding from me. She's still my baby.\" \"She's her own woman now,\" Hestia says as she dumps the herbs into a small bowl and adds some butter to it. \"They're obviously happy. Hades seems happier than he ever was.\" \"So help me if you say that he's a better god because of her, I'm going to make that butter go rancid.\" The two of them begin laughing. They've heard it before -- people have told Demeter to her face and Hestia's heard the happy whispers around Olympus. Perhaps it wouldn't sting so much if it wasn't true. \"Besides,\" Demeter continues after a long silence in which she watched Hestia butterfly and quarter a chicken, chop some vegetables and then top the whole thing with the herbed butter before popping it into the oven, \"in all honesty, it's just lonely sometimes. I miss having her around. What do I do now? It's like losing a part of me.\" \"Empty nest,\" Hestia nods. \"I totally understand that.\" She snaps her fingers and a tray of cocktails slowly solidifies on the breakfast bar. Demeter nods. Even though Hestia never married, never had kids, it's clear that she does emphasize with Demeter. Which is why she went straight to Hestia after returning home. But for now, there's something more vexing on her mind. \"Really?\" she stares at the cocktails. \"From the goddess who has her own herb garden out back and is raising her own chickens? Who insists on cooking even though she could will anything into existence? \" \"I hate mixing cocktails. It's so fiddly -- not like cooking,\" Hestia concedes. \"Besides, Apollo and Dionysus have been working on these together and wanted me to taste test them. New flavor line. Called Bacchanalia.\" Demeter accepts the bright yellow drink and sips it. \"Bit twee of a name,\" she muses as the citrus-flavored alcohol slips into her mouth. \"But it's not bad at all.\" Hestia takes the bright blue one. \"No, not bad,\" she agrees. \"And the name is a little too precocious for my taste.\" The two goddess taste the various drinks and critique the flavors (the balsamic strawberry vodka is a particular favorite -- the jalapeno chocolate not so much). \"Do you ever want to get out of the kitchen?\" Demeter asks after they've devoured the roast chicken, vegetables and fresh baked rolls along with the wine. \"I mean, you could have anything you want, but here you are.\" Hestia shrugs. \"I like it here,\" she replied. \"Besides, I could ask the same of you -- what are you going to do now that Persephone is back with her husband?\" \"Fuck if I know,\" Demeter says, then laughs at obscenity that popped out of her mouth. \"I'm going to blame the wine for that one.\" She leans forward and grins at Hestia. \"I know -- you need some inspiration. Let's go out tonight. Take a night off from the kitchen.\" A slight grin breaks across Hestia's face. Both of them know the truth -- Demeter doesn't want to go back to her empty home and doesn't want to be alone. It's the closest either of them will get to an admission of the truth, which suits them fine. \"Well, it is Chinese New Year and there's the soup dumplings that I've always wanted to taste,\" she says slowly. \"Not to mention Hong Kong has that obscenely hot crab dish.\" \"Excellent.\" Demeter stands up. \"But what about the others?\" Hestia's grin gets more wicked. \"They're gods dear sister. They can make their own damn food.\"",

    "text": "i. the white bull The stink of miasma fills his nostrils. His son is a monstrous thing, small and soft and fleshy and pale. This is the product of his wife's treachery, of the body she cloaked in wood and hide to deceive him. \"He's called Asterion,\" she says. And what will the king call him, he wonders. What will your human husband call him? He does not ask. He knows something of men, knows it will not matter what Pasiphae calls his son. Men will find their own names for him, each more beastly than the last. His son reaches for him with spidery, grasping fingers, and he flinches away. It is not so terrible to him as it must be to her, who loved the child from the moment it took root inside of her, but still it rankles to know that for all of his strength he has yielded this. He does not think he will be a father again. Perhaps this is what the god intended to achieve by sending him to Crete. Perhaps this is to be his penance, for the sea foam-whiteness of his fur and the wine-darkness of his eyes, so stunning that the cowherds of his homeland put scented garlands about his horns called him Poseidon. ii. the minotaur Asterion sleeps under an arch of stone, his limbs folded beneath him. His arms and legs are man-shaped, thick and unhoofed, but they take no comfort in sprawling as men's limbs do. His mother comes to him in the night, her servants carrying bales of hay before her, and he waits until the others have gone to approach her. His lips are bovine, not made for speaking, but he presses his snout against her fingers as she tells him of the palace's comings and goings. \"Androgeos has gone to Athens for the games,\" she says once, and Asterion thinks nothing of it, for he has never met his half-brother. He has never seen a ship, has never sailed upon the sea, has never participated in games; all of these words are indistinct to him, nothing more than shapes in his ears. He does not see how his fate begins to unfold, even as he sits at his mother's feet with her hand smoothing behind his horns. He does not know that across the sea, Androgeos will be gored by a bull while a guest in the house of Aegeus. In a week's time, King Minos will rage in his throne-room, trembling with grief and ire, and then he will lead his armies across the sea to exact his vengeance. He will return in victory, ships heavy with spoils, and among his prisoners will be fourteen youths, the first of an annual tribute from the conquered city. Seated at his mother's feet, Asterion does not yet know the way the victims will stumble about his home for days before they fall silent. iii. the queen Her son does not kill the victims. Pasiphae hears some of them in the darkness when she goes to visit him. One victim is weeping and beating his fists against the stone. The slave girls, carrying their bales of hay, are alarmed at the sound of it and huddle closer to the torchlight. Ahead of the girls, two large men shoulder a giant axe between them, their muscles straining under the weight of it. Pasiphae leads them to the heart of the labyrinth. Asterion does not make a habit of showing himself while others are present, and indeed he is nowhere to be seen when the men lean the axe against the wall and the girls deposit the hay. She dismisses them to wait around the corner, and her son emerges from the shadows, his eyes glittering in the torchlight. \"The King expects you to eat the victims,\" she says, and her son looks pointedly to the bales of hay in the corner. He has never eaten the flesh of animals, much less of men. \"I expect no such thing,\" she clarifies, and smiles at him. \"Come here.\" He obeys, stilling before her. He is immensely tall, and his horns tower higher still, thick and heavy. She takes one of his hands, broad and wide-knuckled, in her own. His fingers are soft. \"If you should have need of it,\" Pasiphae says, and presses her son's hand over the axe. iv. the priestess Ariadne has never seen her brother before. She has seen the bodies of victims that have been recovered from the labyrinth, the meat hacked from their bones, and that is enough. She is the unwilling priestess of a malevolent spirit, and her brother is its priest, the beastly instrument of its will. She pities and reviles in him turns. How cold it must be in the labyrinth, she thinks. How dark, how lonely, how quiet. But there are the mangled bodies, presented for her father's approval, and nausea gathers in the pit of her stomach at the sight of them. She recognizes each of them, when there is enough to recognize, thinks this one was afraid, this one was defiant, this one cursed my father's name. She does not wish to know how her brother has been compelled to desecrate them. The first year, what victims the guards recovered had been whithered from exposure. Every year since, they have been slaughtered. Ariadne does not know how her mother weeps in her rooms, how her mother's servants steal past the labyrinth's gates in the night. She does not know how the bodies of the victims are cleaved not by axe but by swords. She lies awake in her bed at night, despising her brother, and she does not know how he sits in the darkness and watches as the bodies are dragged away. v. the hero The beast is asleep. It brays upon waking, stumbling away from him and angling its horns towards him in threat. Theseus falters for a moment, because it is a magnificent beast, the head of a most handsome sacrifice upon the body of a man who would raze cities to the ground. The beast does not gore him, as it could. It stands watchfully, powerful chest rising and falling in huffing breaths, arms held ready to strike at its sides. Theseus swings his knife before he can wonder at its reluctance, and it reaches for the massive axe that sits against the wall. The axe sweeps through the air in broad, clearing strokes, and Theseus leaps out of its way. He is too quick for it, and the wrath of the beast has been roused, now. It tosses its head and charges, dropping the axe against stone with a thunderous clatter. Theseus' knife catches it beneath the ribs, and it bellows. The beast crashes at his feet, and Theseus kneels beside it. It scrabbles a hand in his chiton, not in aggression but in fear, and Theseus feels his breath catch in his throat. Ariadne did not warn him of this. He thinks he understands, in that moment, in the heart of the labyrinth. He presses the seeking hand between his own, and weighs the injustice he has committed against the one he has ended. Ten heartbeats, and it is over.",

    "text": "Aphrodite: Dear child, see how Leto's shining son holds tightly to that crown of laurels. Hermes says he has just returned from Thessaly after chasing that darling daughter of Peneus. But the poor girl was so frightened of Apollo that she fled at the sight of his smooth face. I know you, my own archer, have toyed with Phoebus' heart yet again! Eros: Were his heart not so easy to pierce, he need not worry about my golden darts. Aphrodite: Were he not so sorrowful I would applaud you, my brave child. Not many have crossed that fair Delian god and lived. What has the Far-Shooter done to earn your own dreaded arrows that cause man to lose his wits and even gods theirs? So enflamed was his passion for this Naiad that I cannot be sure whether you shot him with your golden arrow or if you had placed upon him your lit torch. But of Daphne I am sure; you have shot her with your leaden arrow. Within her bosom ignited a scorn so great she would rather be a tree than love even shining Phoebus whom so many have already loved before. Eros: I pretend not that I am a warrior-archer like my latest victim. I do not plague Achaeans with pestilence and disease. I do not even shoot wild beasts like arrow-showering Diana beloved of the Arcadians. But my tasks are important, too, and my arrows strike true and purposefully. Aphrodite: They needn't even strike. A prick is enough to cause their maddening effect. Eros: True, mother. And yet, Apollo vexes me with taunts. Why, the other day, he asks what have I to do with weapons of war. Better I leave my bow and arrows in his capable hands he says! Aphrodite: I am sure it was in jest. Must you punish him so? Eros: Yes! He boasts of his conquering of the Python at Delphi's Castalian Springs. Such an old beast, that offspring of Gaia, that even I may have been able to slay it. He forgets that I have had victories over our Father Zeus whose shield resounds in thunder. Many forms have I forced Zeus to take: a swan for Leda, showering gold for Danae, and an eagle for Ganymede! Aphrodite: Have a care what you say, dear Eros. Thundering Zeus has endured your many pranks but there is no telling if he shall have the patience for more. Eros: No worries, mother. Zeus enjoys our spells more than he cares to admit. Aphrodite: I suppose that is the reason that his thunderbolts have yet to strike you. But, darling boy, I think we have caused Leto's son enough misfortune. Indeed, we have blessed him with so many to love but he has lost nigh all of them in some tragedy or another. Eros: What do you propose I do, mother? Have I not earned the right to see him punished? Aphrodite: Ah, but I think it is not to see him punished that you desire. I have seen the way you leave your playmate Hymenaios to watch Apollo gather the Muses to sing. Eros: What of it? I think their compositions are grand. And I am not alone in this. The Muses attract the attention of all who have ears to listen and eyes to see. Poets and musicians gather at my beloved Thespiae to celebrate them every five years. Aphrodite: A grand celebration it is, I have noticed. But then what of your gazing at handsome Phoebus as he strums his lyre when there are beautiful goddesses that dance around him? Eros: I admire his hands! That is all. How quick they strike each string and produce sweet songs. Aphrodite: Skilled his hands are, I agree. I seem to recall you gazing upon them once more a few days ago as Apollo practiced with his silver bow. I did not see you follow the arrow as it traveled to strike each target precisely at the center. And how far the targets were! All the way in Ionia where his sister has that grand temple at Ephesus. Eros: I was distracted by how majestic Hephaestus' work was and nothing more. The great smith made my bow, too, and I only wanted to see whose was better. Aphrodite: And the verdict? Eros: I cannot say. Aphrodite: That is because you think the silver bow's owner majestic, not his weapon. Oh, darling child, I had known for a while you were infatuated with Leto's radiant son. Do not be ashamed. I do not disapprove. Eros: It is not your approval I seek but his. Mother, he treats me like I am a child with toys. He regards my archery as inferior to his though I have shot more targets in my time than he. I only want him to look upon me with favour. But if he will not favour me, then I shall not favour him. Aphrodite: Come here, sweet boy. Let us not be so petty like mortals; we are greater than that. I believe you may yet succeed in your endeavour for Phoebus' affections. Eros: How can I? He is in grief, and rightfully so I say! Aphrodite: Hush. Leave behind your maddening arrows and your splendid bow. You will not need them when you speak with Phoebus. Instead, I will have soft-speaking Peitho accompany you should you lose your words. And your brother Himeros to carry his torch and make you desirable more than you already are. Eros: Must I go apologize to him? I would prefer not as I have lost my nerve. I fear he may strike me and I cannot imagine a worse outcome. Aphrodite: Not even were Athena to come and make good of her threats and rip away your wings so you may not fly too close to her? Eros: Nay, mother. Not even that is worse than Apollo's eternal scorn. Aphrodite: Then you must go now lest he make up his mind permanently. Eros: Very well. Eros: For all your oracles in Greece and Asia, I find it ironic that you were unable to foresee Daphne's fate. Apollo: I see that you have come to brag about another one of your victories over me. Begone, winged fiend! Love blinds even the wisest of prophets. They cannot see what is before them if they are maddened by your spells. Man abandons the riches of the earth and the gods fall on their knees before you. I am thankful my divine sister is immune to your tricks. Eros: Why do you say that? Do you not wish her married to a handsome hero that will pamper her? Perhaps that giant huntsman Orion whom your sister so often joins in hunt. Apollo: I certainly do not for you will only curse their union and cause her distress. She is perfect as she is, chaste and virginal. Should you even pull your string against her I shall pull mine against you. Eros: It is useless to think about anyway. Her heart cares only for the hunting of beasts and her holy groves. Apollo: But why are you here? Have you not caused me enough heartache? Many have you forced upon my heart and then cruelly taken them away. I curse the day you were given your wretched bow. Eros: You brought it upon yourself! Much power I wield over you, yet you slight me so. Apollo: Wretched child! You think you are innocent and immune from discipline because of your youth but I foresee a day when your own charms shall bewitch you. Your golden mother's marble halls shall fall into disuse and you will eventually abandon your post. The earth will grow old and slowly wither and die. You will know loss as I know it now. Eros: It is impossible, what you say. My mother is beloved by the people of Greece and Rome, of Syria and Cyprus, of Asia and Europe. Apollo: I have seen it before me and I cannot lie. You cannot escape it. Finally, tears I see in your eyes. Eros: I do not wish to hear more. I have come to apologize but you only wish to see me pained. Apollo: Very well, I shall not continue my prophecy should I hear your apology. Eros: It was not my intention for Daphne to cause you this much torment. I had not known that her father Peneus would take pity on her and turn her into a tree. Apollo: I have made her my sacred tree and my priestess at Delphi shall burn her sacred leaves to receive my words. But what was your intention then? Eros: I only wanted to teach you a lesson that I am not some youngster playing with tools of war. You plague man with illness but I shower them with love. The bow has many uses and it brings not only death but also life. If my shots were lethal like yours, then no one would fall in love and multiply. The earth would be a sad place. Apollo: A lesson I have not learned over and over again. It seems that you do not tire of teaching it after each lover has passed. Eros: I am sorry. Apollo: Very well. I have learned my lesson. Though I suppose I must commend you on your aim. Many a time have you struck me and still I had not seen it coming. Oh, what is this? Why do you embrace me? Eros: Finally you acknowledge me instead of teasing me. Apollo: My acknowledgement is what you sought? Wherefore? Eros: I have admired you from afar, Phoebus. So grand are your talents! Singing, dancing, strumming your lyre. I can only dream of learning a tune to please your ears. Of prophesying, too, are you talented and you compete with Hermes in the games of the gymnasium. But shooting arrows is the only thing we have in common. I had thought should I impress you, you would surely look upon me with favour. Apollo: Love has admired me? For how long? I had thought myself forever afflicted to be scorned by Love and his golden arrows. Eros: I cannot say for certain when I have liked you. All I know is that I do. Apollo: Silly, boy. Much pain you have caused me over the years. Why, I still cannot contain the grief I hold for the loss of Hyacinthus. So young was he when that fateful discus struck his temple, blown there fiercely by jealous Zephyrus. Eros: Do not worry, Phoebus. A discus cannot spill my blood for I have none. Apollo: Then perhaps our love shall withstand the test of time. Or will you forsake me like all the others? Eros: I do not know. You are the prophet, why do you not tell me? Apollo: I have tried to tell you an earlier prophecy but you dreaded to hear it. But an earlier point I said is true as well: Love blinds even the wisest of prophets.",

    "text": "i. Koson runs a respectable establishment, mind you. He doesn't put up with what some of his fellow tavern-keepers do in the way of patrons, the trash and troublemakers who slouch at their tables only to cause trouble. No, he deals with them as he sees fit, bodily hefting them out of their seats into the storm outside. \"Apologies,\" he tells his two remaining customers as he returns from getting rid of the most recent bunch of rabble-rousers (some bearded tough--and his cronies--who claims to be an Achaean king on a quest. Ha!). \"It's not often so rowdy.\" The dark-eyed woman is still bent over her needlework, undisturbed through all the commotion. She hasn't looked up even to answer his questions--but her husband, a red-haired man with a foxlike face, has been watching the encounter with fascinated amusement, and laughs. \"Think nothing of it,\" says Aethon of Crete. ii. They stay longer than they had planned, the man and his wife. They've come all the way from the south, they explain, and it's the wrong season now to make the journey back, so Koson offers to let them stay in his home for a negotiable price. At first this confuses them. It seems they expect Koson to house them for free, but they understand fairly quickly and work out a compromise. Aethon entertains the children by telling fantastic stories that he always denies come from his own imagination, and his wife takes in neighbors' wool and spins fine, smooth thread. Later, she shows them how to find beehives and, having smoked out the creatures, fearlessly plunges her hands into the hive to pull out honeycomb. Even her husband seems surprised at this, before he murmurs: \"Your cousin Philonoe used to keep bees. I remember that.\" She smiles at him. iii. Koson senses this must be a second marriage for his visitors. The woman, especially; her face is worn with crow's feet rather than laugh lines, but she smiles often enough when her husband is nearby. She has a careful and practiced hand with the children, and she might have raised one or two of her own, once. And Aethon--he must have loved her long, perhaps even when she was married to another; always he watches her idly out of the corner of his eye, as though she might disappear if he stops looking. When he's not telling the children stories, he alternates between speaking to them as adults who can understand anything and condescending outrageously. When he watches her with them, there is a bitter cast to his eyes. They're older than they appear to be, and younger than they think they are. Koson can't help but pity them. iv. (On the day he means to depart with oar over his shoulder, Penelope meets him on the steps of the palace. A traveling cloak is thrown over her plain peplos, and a spindle hangs at her hip. \"I remember all too well what my husband told me when he left for Troy,\" she says when he protests. \"Wait until my son grew his first beard, and then leave this palace with the man who pleases me best. I intend to keep my promise.\" \"But Telemachus--\" She cuts him off with a chuckle. \"Telemachus might not have learned the ways of war from you,\" she tells him, \"but statecraft he mastered at my knee. He'll be fine.\" \"But--\" \"You took twenty years to come back last time,\" she says, and that might be laughter in her eyes, or anger instead. \"How could I ever let you leave me again?\") v. When a bard from Achaea come to his tavern, Koson's guests rise to meet him. \"Friend,\" says the woman, \"will you go to Ithaka, where Telemachus reigns?\" \"I might,\" says the Achaean, \"What news should I take him?\" Koson, wiping tables, pays more attention. Odysseus's tale has spread even this far north. \"Tell him--\" says Aethon, and considers Koson \"--tell him his father flourishes among the Theosprotians, having yielded to their entreaties and wed soft-eyed Kallidike--\" \"Oh, he has, has he?\" interrupts his wife dryly. \"--and, now entangled in battle, plans to install their son as king.\" \"Their son a king already?\" His wife touches a hand to the growing swell of her stomach. \"It's not been two years since Odysseus left Ithaka.\" Aethon ignores her. \"Tell him this, too, that Aethon of Crete expects his love for the news, and you shall have my gratitude.\" vi. With his own hands, Aethon fashions a house for himself and his wife. She seems oddly critical of most of the details; he tells her, with what seems to be real regret, that no olive trees grow in this climate. But when he leads her there, inviting Koson along to admire his work, Aethon's wife cries out with joy to see a loom set up by the front window. Koson is, to his own surprise, sad to see them go. It's more than the money they brought in by spinning wool and tales respectively; Aethon had been in the middle of describing the encounter between a foolish hero and a ferocious Cyclops, and Koson has been as anxious as the children to see how it all turns out. \"Nonsense,\" Aethon points out when Koson mentions this. \"We're only a little down the hill. I'll tell you the rest at dinner.\" vii. \"What will you name him?\" asks Koson's wife, already sure the coming child will be a son. \"Hmm,\" says the woman, \"Poliporthes, I think. For his father.\" Sacker of cities, Koson translates; an odd description of peaceful, merry Aethon, but how can he judge? Now, though, considering his friends' pleasure, he dares voice the question he's nursed for months. \"Listen,\" he asks Aethon, \"I mean no offence, but what is that contraption you carried in with you?\" Aethon and his wife look at each another, and, strangely, begin to deliberate between themselves. \"Tiresias said it would be called a winnowing fan. Surely that doesn't count.\" \"We could perform the sacrifices, of course, just to be safe--\" \"But there's no need to leave just yet--\" \"None at all.\" Thus resolved, they turn back to Koson. \"It's nothing, my friend,\" Odysseus says, not quite repressing a smile. \"Nothing at all.\"",

    "text": "In the end it was Laura's younger brother, Derek, who provided the answer. Well, actually it was one of Derek's mortal pack members who just so happened to also be the father of his consort. The man acted as a sort of law enforcer amongst the mortals, and so it was his idea to send a messenger to Peter and the Underworld to negotiate. The Hale Alpha agreed readily, for he feared that the longer Lydia remained in Peter's clutches the more likely it was that Laura would do something drastic. It had already been a few weeks, and they all were worried. By this point, Peter had figured out that Lydia was his mate, and something long buried had awakened within him at this revelation. He did not want to force Lydia into becoming his, and so he kept his distance when she requested it. He used his magic to sustain her so that she would not hunger, though as water can have no owner she was free to drink from the underground springs at her leisure. That had been a lively debate they had engaged in. Peter had been surprised but pleased to discover his mate was not as empty-headed as she sometimes pretended to be aboveground. Stupidity bored him, and that Lydia could keep him on his toes just made him want her more. She was fond of him, and often visited him in his throne room, but he knew she wished to return home, and that kept him in check. The atmosphere of the Underworld was that of a perpetual twilight, due to there being no sun, and it was as they discussed how there could still be light, faint as it was, underground that Peter felt it--a mage trying to gain entry to his domain. The smile that had begun to form on his face disappeared as he granted access to the intruder. Lydia stood up, shocked at whom it was that stepped out of the shadows and into Peter's throne room. Stiles had been a childhood friend of hers before she was chosen to be one of Laura's and he had been chosen to study magic under Sage Deaton, but she did not know he had become so powerful. Peter, on the other hand, merely smirked as the young one who smelled of his nephew, Derek, came forward demanding Lydia's return. Normally Peter would have shown this upstart what true power was, Alpha's mark or not, but Lydia's hand on his arm stopped him. It had been a surprise when Derek's consort himself stepped forward, but no one denied that Stiles had a way with words unlike any other. Peter was a manipulative bastard, but if anyone could match him, it was Stiles. He outlined why he had come and what Laura was doing to the world above; he then explained that if Lydia were not returned, none would stop Laura when she tried to take Lydia back for herself. For Laura would come, and her wrath would be great, but it would be directed only at Peter. As he would be the only one in any danger, it would not be cause enough for the rest of the Underworld to go to war. Peter knew at this point that he was beaten--for now--and as he nor the Underworld had yet claimed Lydia as theirs, he could not stop her from leaving him. He turned his back on Stiles, not wanting to see his mate leave with him, when he was brought up short by seeing Lydia drink from his goblet of wine. Wine made from the fruits of the Underworld. As Lydia watched the events unfold, she knew what she had to do. She had felt this bond growing between her and Peter during the time she had been with him, but she also knew that he had never forced anything upon her. He was unsubtle in his affections for her, and obviously wanted her for more than just her beauty, but he was willing to let her leave him if that was what she wished. It was her choice, it always had been, and yet she knew there was only one option for her. Stiles let out a cry of despair as Lydia handed the goblet back to Peter, for he also knew that to partake of the food of the Underworld was to become bound to the Underworld. The smile on Peter's face was blinding as she pressed her lips to his with promises to return. She tasted of light and the thickly sweet pomegranate wine she had just drank, and it was the most beautiful thing he had ever tasted. He would let his mate go and explain the situation to her former mistress, but she would be back. And that was what mattered. ~THE END~",

    "text": "At sixteen, Kore's mother took her to Mount Olympus for the first time. Before that, life had been a hazy montage of dancing under a warm sun, swimming in clear sparkling pools and Demeter's mellow chuckles. The Goddess of the harvest deplored the necessity of taking Kore to be presented in the palace of mighty Zeus, particularly at such a busy time of year. Kore's presentation had already been delayed a year longer than was usual however, and it Demeter waited until her sweet child was seventeen summers old, the ever easily offended Olympians would take umbrage. To Olympus they were to go, and it Demeter's only offspring must be paraded around like a sacrificial bull, then it would be done properly with none of the mortifying carousing that she remembered from her own banquet. She dressed her daughter in her finest chiton, simple sunbleached linen that befitted Kore's youth and innocence. Her dark curls clustered about her head like the petals of a hyacinth. Demeter did not bedeck her daughter in golden jewelery, she herself did not like the feel of the cold metal and surely there was no master craftsman among mortals who could rival the delicate splendour of her own dear flowers. She might, had she thought to ask, have been disappointed to know that Kore did not share her sentiments. The warm shimmer of gold pleased the maiden, Kore. She could grow the rarest and most perfect of flowers with a little concentration of power but owned nothing that had been so painstakingly crafted as the majestic jewels worn by the other gods in her father's palace. They reached Olympus in good time and made their stately procession to the throne room. Zeus sat upon his seat of authority at the far end of the pillared court. His head was inclined to his brother Poseidon, mighty ruler of the oceans, but he looked up when a nymph announced that the Lady Demeter had arrived with the honoured Kore. The court was bustling with richly clad deities, who ceased their chatter when great Zeus rose from his throne, extending his sceptre to his daughter. She knew what to do, and made her way forward to press her lips to the tip. Zeus was pleased to smile and bid her welcome, in his booming voice, as she curtseyed low. She turned then to Poseidon and repeated her obeisence. Having received the sea-king's gracious nod finally faced the dark King Hades, ruler of the Underworld and the eternity after mortal death. She was too in awe of him to raise her eyes to his, but she heard him quietly accept her homage. Zeus had turned to speak again to his sea dwelling brother and once again the great palace was filled with chatter. Kore kept her gaze in the golden sandals of the Rich One, waiting for Demeter to come forward and bear her off. Her mother did not come, a hurried glance told her that Demeter was in deep conversation with Queen Hera, neither goddess appeared pleased. Hades stood and lifted Kore's chin with a long, pale finger. 'My brother addressed you as Kore. Have you no other name but girl?' He looked directly into her green eyes with his own black fathomless ones. His voice was deep but low in volume- Kore had no difficulty in hearing him. His was the ancient echo of authority, the eldest and most terrible of the great Kings. If he spoke in a whisper, Kore's ears would strain to harken. 'I have no other name, Lord Hades.' His penetrating stare was uncomfortable. She tried a tremulous smile. 'The mortals call me springtime. My Lady mother says that Kore suits me well enough.' He released her chin and looked to her mother, considering her answer. 'A lack of foresight on my sister's part, then. One day the timid girl will be a woman and then 'Kore' shall not suit.' He said it lightly enough, but Kore felt a flush creep up her neck. Hades looked on, seemingly fascinated. She pressed her lips together and curtseyed once more to the dour Lord of the dead, who so towered over her. 'I must not beg your pardon for my name, my Lord- it was my mother's doing and there was little thought of pleasing you when I was born.' It was an impertinant speach but he did not look angry. Instead, he tilted his head slightly and hooded his eyes. 'Girl suits you well enough for now,' he murmured, cryptically 'perhaps you will aquire a better name in time.' He bent his head to her and in the next instant was gone in a ripple of black silk. Demeter laid a hand on her shoulder and Kore jumped. 'I hope you were polite to Lord Hades, Kore. He left quickly, did he seem displeased with you? He is not one to cross, my daughter.' Kore turned, 'I do not think he was displeased, precisely, mother...but I do not think he cares for my name.' 'Your name?' the Goddess of the crops looked startled, 'what interest is your name to him?' She shrugged, 'I'd not fret, Kore. The chances are you'll not lay eyes on him for a century or so- I haven't.' Demeter was proven wrong, the tall, shadowy figure of the dreaded god of curses was seen at the banquet that evening, he did not attempt conversation with her, but as she sipped at her cup of sweet ambrosia, Kore felt his watchful eyes on her often throughout the evening. She had a marvellous night, reclined on her left was the demi-god Pirithous who openly admired her blushing face as he told the rapt maiden tales of his mighty deeds. To her right, was the gentle Hephaistus who sternly told Pirithous to keep the bawdier tales for older ears than those of sweet Kore. Hephaistus had a kindly manner about him and Kore listened to his descriptions of the precious things he had made. He laughed softly when she asked if he could create a garden of metal flowers that grew and looked thoughtful when she spoke of Demeter's desire for a horseless chariot. By the time rosy fingered dawn swept away the dusky blanket of night, a happy but slightly tipsy Kore skipped down the mountain. Demeter, even more affected by Dionysius' sweet wine than her daughter, followed more sedately. Kore hardly minded that the two of them had a long walk home ahead of them, in the fresh air of the early morning it sounded the ideal solution to clearing her head. Demeter however, was not looking forward to it and remarked that Apollo might have offerred to take them home with his splendid horses. As Kore rounded the last corner of the winding path that led down Olympus' slopes, she was surprised to see the dark figure of Hades standing at the bottom. He casually held the reins of a steaming, stomping set of horses that were straining against the stillness that he imposed on them. Kore hesistated and her mother caught up with her. 'Brother! What keeps you so near the mountain? I should have expected that you would be halfway back to the Underworld by now.' 'I would bear you both home in my chariot, if you don't care for the walk.' He spoke to Demeter, but did not take his gaze from Kore. Demeter actually smiled warmly at him. 'I thank you, then. Kore here does not mind walking, but after a night of merry making, my poor head was dreading it more than my feet. Come, Kore!' Kore eyed the six snorting beasts. 'Is it safe?' She blurted. Demeter looked scandalised, 'Kore!' Hades lifted an eyebrow as Demeter stepped up onto the silver edged conveyance. 'I hope have strength enough to keep my own horses in check.' 'I did not mean...I'm sorry, I thank you for your kindness. Forgive me!' 'I know, child. It is well. I shall not let you fall.' With that he stepped up behind her and took the reins either side of her waist. Kore was surrounded by his arms and although he did not touch her, she was very aware of him. Demeter smiled. 'There Kore! 'tis a perfect solution, you cannot possibly be afraid now.' Could she not indeed? Did her mother think that standing in the arms of the King of the dead was somehow less daunting than falling from a fast moving vehicle? Kore wasn't sure herself. She comforted herself with the knowledge that her mother, even befuddled by wine, would not allow her to come to harm. Hades flicked his wrists and the horses surged forward. Kore shut her eyes and clutched the silver edge of the wood that stood between her and the galloping steeds. They picked up speed, until the wind was so loud in her ears that she could hardly make out the short conversation between Demeter and her august sibling. She could not say how long they sped through the world before reaching the homely meadow in which she had passed so many carefree says. When they came to a smooth half outside Demeter's little cottage, Kore stumbled out of the chariot and emptied the contents of her stomach onto the grass. 'Kore'!' said her mother, again. The maiden sat down amongst the flowers, heaving great gulps of air, uncaring of now her dress might strain or crumple. She glanced at Hades, whose expression was inscrutable. She lifted the corner of her mouth. 'Thank you for the ride, my Lord.' She said, politely. 'Mother. I think, perhaps that it might be better to not ask Hephastus to fashion us a chariot, I believe walking suits me rather better.' Demeter sniffed. 'He'd not oblige me anyway, my girl...at least not for any price I was willing to pay.' On impulse, Kore bent to the ground and touched the fertile earth. She concentrated hard, half heartedly listening to her mother and uncle. A flower sprang up and bloomed at her gentle urging and when it opened It's petals, they were a rich, vibrant purple. Hades turned his faced to Demeter, who shifted uncomfortably. 'What did he demand?' He sounded interested and Kore stood closer to hear her mother's reply. Demeter's voice turned hard and she looked significantly at her slight daughter. 'Something too precious for a lame blacksmith to posess.' Kore's eyes widened. 'Mother?' She had not heard such steely contempt Demeter's tone before. She tentatively spoke, 'It...it isn't his fault he's lame...he's a very good craftsman, he makes King Zeus' thunderbolts after all.' Demeter scowled. 'Are you telling me that you have entertained his suit, girl? Without my knowledge?' 'His suit? Oh no! I only spoke to him at the banquet...he was kind.' Demeter looked likely to rage at her until Hades lifted his palm. 'Enough. She is innocent. I shall speak to our ambitious smithy.' Kore gaped at him. His voice had changed from a pleasing, smooth rumble to something flinty and terrible. She saw quite clearly why the mortals feared him so much that they did not even speak his name. She herself, a lesser Goddess, was affected and trembling. Demeter put an arm about her shoulders and nodded at Hades. 'Perhaps you are right, my Lord. I shall leave it to you.' He stepped onto his chariot and very nearly smiled when Kore shuddered. 'Farewell, sister. Blessings to you, my Lady.' Kore felt her mother's surprise and sank to low curtsey. 'I wish you a safe journey, sir.' She stepped forward to offerred him the flower, 'Thank you for bringing us home.' Demeter looked proud at her daughters thoughtful manners. Hades took the bloom and stared intently at Kore for so long that she feared that she had offended the Rich One with her simple gift. Eventually, he lifted it to his nose and inhaled. 'So precious a gift for so trifling a service. It hardly seems a fair exchange.' She suspected him of mockery for a moment and frowned. His voice was, once more low and thrumming, with all traces of its previous danger, erased. It occurred to her that he was deliberately gentling his usual aura of menace for their benefit and wondered why. His horses snorted and pulled and then he was gone. Demeter looked at her beautiful daughter. 'Well, my dearest! We need not trouble our heads about the blacksmith. Hades likes to keep the distinction of rank, preserved.' Kore felt sleepy and yawned. 'Yes, mother. Poor Hephastus. I think I shall rest for an hour. I am so glad I am not mortal, dear Mother. They could not feast all night as I have. They must waste so much time asleep.' The chestnut haired girl put her head on her arms and thought for a moment. 'Was Lord Hades so intimidating against the Titans?' She enquired. Demeter turned grave at the memory. 'He was much worse, little one. No god killed so many as he. He dealt merciless death even then. I have wondered often, if the fates intended for him to draw the shortest straw when the world was divided. I don't think either of my other brothers could rule the Underworld so well as he.' Demeter smiled. 'Did he frighten you very much, darling?' 'I think he must frighten everyone. ' She kissed Demeter's warm, sun kissed cheek. 'I had a wonderful time. Thank you for taking me.' She fell onto a doze amongst the sweet, bright poppies and dreamt of joyful music, dancing nymphs and of the swirling faces of all the gods she had seen that night. (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Kore spent the next few weeks lingering close to her mother. Demeter kept her daughter nearby, taking Kore with her to the fields when she blessed the freshly sown seed. The corn and wheat would grow plump and strong this year, the grateful mortals would have a plentiful harvest. Eventually, Demeter allowed Kore to wander further afield with the nymphs and Kore relished the small freedom. They danced together in shallow streams, splashing and frolicking under Helios' bright rays. Sometimes, Kore would lead her friends into the shady forests, searching for a cool place to lie beneath the leafy canopy. She often felt watched during those times as she rested on the sweet smelling floor of fallen leaves. The feeling did not worry her, her mother was renowned for being protective of her child--if she sent someone to keep watch over her safety it was nothing unusual. On one bright, shining jewel of a day, Kore was wandering in the meadow near Demeter's grove. The nymphs were dozing on the banks of the stream at the bottom of the poppy field, Kore had wandered away from the group for a moment of solitude. Demeter had travelled to her white temple in the west to bless the mortals who worshipped there so diligently. Kore had been feeling on edge ever since her mother left. As she stooped to admire the vibrant red of a poppy, she felt the first tremblings of the earth as thunder rolled in from afar. Thinking it may be an approaching storm, Kore turned back towards the sleeping nymphs--intent on waking them and seeking shelter. She stopped still after a few steps in confusion. The rumbling was louder now and not in the distant, cloudless skies, but deep in the earth beneath her. No sooner had she realised this than she felt the ground quake beneath her feet. The bewildered goddess started to run, in her fear, not towards the sleeping maidens--but instead towards the shadowy forest. Her mother's meadow creaked and groaned, ever increasing in volume. A turbulent wind started to blow, billowing about her and whipping her long hair up into her face. Kore, truly alarmed and running in earnest now, turned her head in time to see the meadow split and heave before parting itself in a great cavernous entrance, to hell. A moment later and the thundering of heavy hooves rang out loudly from the depths within. She looked ahead to the forest and did not need to look back to see that they pursued her. The world seemed to blur before her eyes as she fled, faster than she had ever run before. Her heart pounded from within her chest and she had not even enough breath to scream her terror to the skies. She felt the beasts gain on her, almost so close that their breath stirred the hair that streamed out behind her. Kore heard the peculiar beat of the horses hooves as they drew alongside her. For a breathless, sobbing moment, Kore thought that they might pass her by, that her instinct had been at fault and that she had not needed to flee. In that moment she faltered and turned her head to look. Her fearful eyes just had time to see the grim faced god of the dead reach over the side of his chariot and with one hand still holding the reins, grasp her firmly by the waist and haul her to his chest. Kore knew, instinctively that if he took her back with him, underneath the earth, there would be no hope for her. She opened her mouth and screamed. Wordless, panic filled cries. She beat her hands against Hades' black armoured torso, kicked at his shins and tried to fling herself out of his grasp. His arm was unyeilding about her, it did not even loosen when she scratched and bit at it. The chariot made a sweeping arc in the meadow and, without breaking its pace-- sped downwards into the passage that had been ripped into the earth. Kore's screams fell silent when the ground closed over above them. She saw only the faint glimmer of ghostly light ahead of them in the suffocating darkness. For the first time in her happy, sheltered life-- Kore fainted. **** When she came to, it was with the sensation of being lifted from the chariot by strong arms. There was enough pale light to make out Hades unmoving countenance. She closed her eyes again, not wishing to look on the face of the fearsome man who would deliberately tear her from her mother's protection. The King bore her in his arms for a little way until she heard the gentle lapping of water on a shore. She opened her eyes as they boarded a boat. Hades stood unmoving at the prow, looking onward across the river as a hooded, skeletal figure steered the vessel through the inky black waters. He did not speak, but Kore knew that he was watching her. As they reached the far shore, so hopelessly far from her home, the pale light changed from something watery and cold to a strong warmth that she thought at first might be the sun. She raised her head in bewilderment and looked about her. Tall grasses wafted in a gentle breeze, unrecognizable flora bloomed and tall trees stretched their branches wide beneath a misty sky. Kore did not think that it could possibly be the sky, but the swirling whiteness was high enough up that it made no difference. Hades did not set her down to get off the boat, he stepped down into the water and waded through the shallow waves to the shore. A different chariot stood waiting, held by a servant in a grey cloak. He bowed to his master and handed over the reigns but did not speak. The dread Lord set the terrified Kore down on the floor of the chariot and flicked the reigns. Kore hid her face in her hands and wept until they stopped again. He did not lift her this time, merely taking her hand and tugging her to her feet. She did not know how her legs supported her, but was glad they did since the only other option was utterly abhorrent. Hades led her through great iron wrought gates, through courtyard gardens and into an immense palace. Once inside, they made their way past silent servants and into a throne room. Hades throne stood on a dias against a wall of beaten gold and was itself encrusted with diamonds. He released her trembling fingers and went to sit on it. He made an imposing figure, sitting on his shining chair--a massive figure in black thrown into sharp relief by the brilliance of the gold behind him. Beaten into the metal wall were images of the crowned Hades waging war against the Titans, a suitable reminder of the power of the god before whom little Kore now stood. He did not speak, just watched her, his elbows resting on diamond arms and long fingers steepled under his chin. Abducting an innocent maiden did not seem to trouble him, his expression was no different to the first time she had seen him at her presentation in Zeus' palace. Kore thought of her mother. She would do anything to return to her arms again. Approaching the dias, she mounted the steps and lowered herself down. She reached up her hands to grasp King Hades' knees through the thick silk of his long robes. Tears fell from green eyes and down her lovely cheeks as she made the ancient gesture of supplication. His eyes glittered strangely and he sat, a tensed coil, watching her in deafening silence. Kore gasped for the right words. 'Will my Lord, o mighty Hades, tell me what manner of offence I have committed against your majesty, that I have been punished so cruelly?' Her voice sounded hoarse and raw, her mouth tasted of blood. Her eyes darted to the forearm of her captor and widened at the trickle of red streaming from the imprint of teeth there. His hand darted out to rest on her bent head, then gently swept back the curls that hid her face from him. Kore clung to his knees and tried not to flinch at the carressing touch. When he spoke, his voice was low and intimate''. 'You have stolen from me, sweet Kore.' Her head shot up in astonishment, to see the corners of his mouth curl upwards in a mirthless smile. Relief flooded her. It was a simple misunderstanding. 'Majesty, I have not. I have taken nothing from you, I...I wouldn't.' He frowned slightly, Hades was not a being that was often contradicted. 'I say that you have. You stood before me at Olympus, since then, I have had no peace of mind. You stood within the circle of my arms, and now they can find no comfort. Since you bestowed on me a humble bloom, I have had no joy in all the riches of the earth.' Kore, horrified by his tender passion, tore her hands away from the backs of his knees and scrambled away from him. A single strand of her hair remained caught in his hand and he wound it around his forefinger. 'I do not seek to punish you, little one. Merely to put you where the fates have decreed that you belong. By my side, crowned and named as Hades' queen.' Kore, white faced, sat on the bottom step of the dias. Her mind was a whirl. Hades wanted her. He wanted to wed her. He would have her regardless of her inclination, was it not the way of things for women? His voice was calm and soft but Kore heard the edge of implacability that resonated from the King. In this moment, with the evidence of his power beaten into the very walls of his palace, Kore was not going to court his anger. She wanted to survive, she wanted to see her mother again. Mother would find a way to free her, but until then, it was up to Kore to use all the cunning of the fabled Odysseus and out manouver the King. How many people had crossed Hades and lived? She swallowed the bile that rose in her throat and gave an almost imperceptible nod. Hades noticed it and some of the tension left him. 'You do me great honor, my Lord.' The girl rasped and could say no more. It was courteous and utterly an unobjectionable thing to say to a betrothed husband. He stood and reached down to aid her to her feet, for an instant Kore battled with the desire to simply scream and flee when his hand pressed her to him. As his face neared hers, clearly intent on claiming her mouth, she recalled that there was no one to hear her screams and that here in the Underworld, there was nowhere to flee to. He surprised her by not pressing her lips to hers immediately, but instead kissing away the teardrops that she could not prevent from falling. Then his arms surrounded her, one hand burying itself in her hair to angle her head and he brought his mouth down to meet hers. She had always thought that kissing somebody was an odd thing to want to do, the act of putting ones face so close to a man's was surely an uncomfortable experience. Kore had been correct, at least, about it not being comfortable. She burned when fighting the waves of sensation and was further enflamed when she at last surrendered to him. A short time later, after which Hades heaved a sigh and ran a thumb over her swollen lips as he pressed a final kiss to her forehead. 'Kore will not do, you know.' he murmured in her ear, 'It will not do at all. When I crown you tonight, I shall give you a new name. You will not be a girl after today, my Lady.' He regarded her flushed face and rosy lips with apparent satisfaction. 'I shall crown you Queen Persephone, she who destroys the voices of mortal men. My wife.' Kore frowned in confusion. She had encountered very few mortals and had left them utterly unharmed by the encounter. 'I don't understand.' she whispered as he bent his dark head to press fervent kisses to her palms. He looked up at her question and his eyes were black and stormy. 'I guard what is mine.' he said, 'I shall be a jealous husband, Lady. I will bedeck you in precious, beautiful robes and then smite the eyes of those that linger on you for too long. Only I will whisper your name in hopeful entreaty. Persephone,' he breathed, ' I will put a curse on your name, that if it crosses the lips of a mortal it will mean the death of his voice. No mere man deserves the freedom of your name. The gods will call you my Queen and the world will know that you are entirely mine.' She swallowed but could not break her gaze from his. He seemed to be emitting tangible, violent power, but his face was set in tender lines as he looked at her. She dropped to her knees again to grasp his. 'That is the second time you have done that, little one. The laws of Zeus are not supreme here, I am not obliged to grant you your request. Ask me anyway. Beg me. Entreat. Plead. I would not see you unhappy.' The maiden released his knees and bent her head. 'Lady Demeter, your Majesty. I should like to see her, please. I would have her know that I am unharmed. She will be so unhappy to find me gone. I beseach you, my Lord--give my mother some peace...tell her where I am.' He considered her request. 'She cannot come here and I'll not take my wife above ground so soon after wedding her, 'tis unseemly.' The goddess at his feet waited. 'But,' he said eventually, 'I shall arrange for a message to be taken to Hermes to deliver that you are safe and that she need not look for you.' He looked into her eyes and added, 'I shall present you in Zeus' court within the next year or so, you will see her then.' Kore lowered her eyelids so that her future husband should not see the resentment that must surely be evident. 'Thank you, my Lord.' For good measure, she kissed his hand. 'Are we to wed today, then?' 'Yes, by sunset. Your coronation also. My people will be assembled to greet their new mistress.' Kore tried for a neutral response. 'I shall try to be a good one, sir.' Unbidden, tears sprang from her eyes again and she brushed them away impatiently. Hades saw them and sobely said, 'I see you are overwrought. I will treat you well, Persephone. I do not wish for your unhappiness.' She almost railed at him then. That he should tear her from her home and then deny her her own mothe and claim that he cares for her happiness! Inwardly, Kore scoffed. She thought him presumptious, taking even her name from her. Perhaps, if she bided her time, there would be an evident escape from this place--although where she could hide afterwards was a mystery. It was clear that he'd not let his queen wander far, even if he did eventually tire of her. She had heard stories of his posessive nature. In that moment, hope seemed a fragile, distant thing. A cobweb that would be swept away by the howling wind. She clung to hope and tried to smile. 'Tis just that I am shocked, sir. I had not expected...any of this.' she made an expansive gesture with her hand, encompassing him, his throne room and the entire Underworld in the graceful turn of her wrist. 'I shall try to contain myself a little better, though I am not used to that either.' She thought of Demeters loving tolerance of her daughter's free and easy ways and nearly broke down. 'If there is somewhere I might rest a while and refresh myself, I would be grateful.' Hades nodded once, watching her carefully as though the dam of her emotions might break forth at any moment, likely to knock him aside with their force. He took her hand and led her through high ceilinged, lofty rooms and a maze of airy hallways. Light flooded the palace but no torches burned and there was no sunlight to stream in from without. How then was the darkness kept at bay? It was a mystery that distracted her thoughts from the feel of Hades' hand firmly clasping hers. It occurred to her, as he led her to a luxurious chamber, that the darkest thing about the Underworld, was King Hades himself. Hope you enjoyed it, I found it preposterously hard to write! Sorry its been so very long between updates! Real life has been a bit mad and I've been tapping away at this chapter whenever possible. On the plus side, I've fleshed out the plot a but more and know where I am going, hopefully the words should come a but more easily to me. (See the end of the chapter for more notes.) Persephone did not sleep, the gods so rarely do after all. Instead, she sat stiffly on a delicate, gilded chair and shut her eyes against the sumptuous furnishings. She knew two things for certain. Firstly, if she did not escape from this strange realm of Hades' then she would be wed by nightfall. Secondly, there was no escape from the Underworld. They had crossed the river Styx by boat, the murky waters that the gods swore their oaths by. Hermes, the messenger with the winged sandals told her that he was the only one who could cross it without recourse to the wooden boat. Persephone did not think it at all likely that the boatman would risk the wrath of dark Hades to aid her return home. It seemed that she was stuck here, for the time being, at least. She knew her mother would not rest until she was found and back where she belonged. Demeter could petition Hera and Zeus to make her marraige disappear. Perhaps there was hope after all. She could return to the world she understood and answer to the name bestowed upon her by a loving mother. The hours slipped by, she felt the room chill slightly and when she opened sore, red rimmed eyes she saw that the shadows had lengthened and that a dusky blackness had crept in through the window. Persephone frowned in confusion. It was impossible that the sun could shine so far beneath the earth, how then was there sunlight and a sunset? Despite herself, she gave into her curiousity and wandered to the window. She did not need to lean out far before discovering the source of what little light there was left. An immense ball of fire burned in the center of a great open space. Scores of shades were hanging coloured jewels around it, blocking out its rays. Currently, they rushed to the firey ball with rubies and the light turned rosy and warm as it shone through them. She felt a heavy hand rest on her shoulder. She jumped. 'It is the core of the earth, my Lady. My subjects call it our nether-sun. It serves us well enough for light and warmth but has to be hidden at night. The shades you see there have been sentenced to a hundred years of making the nether-sun rise and set. In a while they will block it out with obsidian.' 'It is very like the sun, above.' she replied, glumly. 'Does it cause flowers to open their petals also?' Hades shook his head. 'The flowers down here are rather different, my sweet. They bloom as they are required to, and that is not so very often.' Kore shivered and Hades led her away from the window to a roaring fire that crackled in a marble hearth. The door to the chamber opened and servants came in bearing armfuls of dresses and jewelled sandals. Hades bent his dark head to her and she noticed that he had discarded his armour for an embroidered cloak trimmed with sleek black fur. 'These are your maids, they are here to dress you for your bridal feast. I hope my gifts please you as much as it pleases me to bestow them.' His hand gently pushed back a heavy lock of hair from her shoulder and his fingers rested there a moment. She was conscious of the intimacy of it all, the rush of warmth to her skin where he touched and dreadfully aware of the servants who were studiously looking anywhere but at their King. Hades pressed his lips to her cheek and murmured in her ear, 'Tonight the Underworld shall gain a Queen of unparalleled beauty. I shall see you anon, fair Persephone.' He was out of the room before she and the waiting women could rise from their curtsies. The women, who were almost certainly mortal came forward to comb her hair and draw her to a golden tub filled with heated water. Persephone had only bathed in cool streams and rockpools before and found the experience very strange, but not entirely unpleasant. When she rose from the sweetly scented water, the women--who largely remained silent, draped her in a gown that was made of gold. It shimmered as they arranged it around her carefully. Golden sandals were slipped on her feet and the leather was so soft she could have been walking on a mossy lawn. She sat through their careful preparations passively enough, allowing them to direct her head as needed for the elborate style they were braiding into her hair. A chest of jeweled hair ornaments was opened and presented for her approval. Kore gaped. Once, in her wanderings in the forests the nymphs had discovered a single emerald hidden in the hollow of a tree. There was no explaination for it being there and no obvious owner. The young goddess had held it up to the sunlight, entranced by the fire that seemed to live inside the stone. The beauty of its colour held her in awe. Her mother had told her that she needed to return it to the hollow, what use had they for the cold gems of the earth? Demeter had grown her a bower of roses to amuse her instead. All the riches of the earth belonged to the Rich One himself, she said. Hades, having no use for life or love, hoarded his wealth possessively. Demeter told her of the great value of the stone, that its price would feed, clothe and house a large mortal family for years to come. Kore had heeded her mother's words and returned the emerald, but every so often revisted the tree, just to look at the stone again. The chest in front of her was overflowing with rubies, diamonds, emeralds and saphires-- each worth a kings ransom. She pointed to the emeralds and the women wove them skillfully into her hair. By the time she was declared ready, torches had been lit around the room. Her head felt heavy with the wealth that nestled in her shining curls and her heart felt heavier still with the increasing certainty that she might never again be the same. A strange kind of dignity held her upright in the midst of her absolute despair. The resolution that if this were to be her fate she would face it with the courage of a woman. A stronger courage than that of men, they would fight and rail against their destiny but a woman would make of it what she could. Such was the lot of women, even amongst the gods. Persephone straightened her shoulders and lifted her chin. She could not quite manage a smile, perhaps that would come later. She nodded gravely to the women who had adorned her with such care and thanked them. She did not smile at the shock they displayed. Hades clearly did not treat his mortal slaves with any kind of civility. They flanked her, as she stepped out of the chamber to turn down vaulted hallways. One day, she would stop to look at the fresco's and tapestries that covered the walls, but not tonight. For now, she would glance neither to the left, nor to the right in curiousity. Hades sat in his throne room, surrounded by a multitude of his subjects. As she approached him, they parted like a field of wheat and cried. 'She comes! She who is honoured by Lord Hades, our great King. Blessings upon the union that brings Springtime to the Underworld.' Hades saw her and rose, extending a white sceptre for her to kiss, She did so and tried not to stare at him staring at her. His was not a face that smiled easily, she realised, but the slight upward lift of his lips and the crinkle in the outward corners of his eyes indicated that he was pleased. He waved his hand and drums began to beat out a stately tattoo. The deep sound echoed long, if the mortal above heard it they would quake in terror. 'I, Hades have commanded your presence here to witness the coronation of my Queen. Upon her head, I will place the diadem of shadows-- she is as eternally bound to me as my own.' The assembly murmured its approval and the drums beat louder. 'In her hand, I shall put the sceptre of time--it is hers to bestow on those who are subject to it.' Persephone blinked, but remained silent as she gripped the carved ivory. The beat of the drums grew louder yet and Hades lifted his voice in one final declaration. 'Around her shoulders, I drape the mantel of my protection, woe to any being that causes her to have need of it. My wrath will be told in the screamings of their agony, forevermore.' He took her hand in his. 'I present my Queen, Persephone. Go forth and tell the realms of her beauty and grace. Her name is cursed, no one shall utter it twice--it is mine. Kneel. Acknowledge her as mine, proclaim her as her majesty requires.' The drums ceased and the echo of their beat faded and died. For a split second, silence descended on the Underworld, even the souls in Tartarus ceased their tormented cries. Then a great roar went up, as loud as anything the young Queen had ever heard and she resisted the urge to cover her ears. Hades raised his hand again and soft pipes and strings began to play a slow, sensual music. Servants came in, laden with trays of food and pitchers of wine. Hades leant down to whisper in his wife's ear. The longest feast on Oympus lasted for three days and nights. In your honor...Hades' realm shall banquet for yet one more.' Her husband (oh the strangeness of it all!) led her to a table and laid her down next to it, cushions of satin were aranged about her and then he took his place opposite her. Servants hurried over, presenting golden platters to their King and silver ones to the Queen. Persephone, as she must be known now, took a selection of meats and fruits, dismissing the girl with a nod of thanks. Hades took from his platter, food like she had never seen before. 'What manner of food is that, Lord Hades? I have never encountered it.' He licked the juice from his thumb before answering her. 'You may address your husband as Hades, Persephone.' His voice deepened and slowed when he spoke to her. Her name was a carress on his tongue. 'The plates of gold bear the food of the dead, it carries with it a curse- those who eat of it are forever bound to me and my /lands.' He smiled briefly at the speed in which his bride dropped her grapes. 'The /food before you is, of course, from the world above. Your soul is yet your own.' 'Why, sir? You have decreed me wife and Queen. It is permanent is it not?' She raised curious eyes to his face and lowered them again quickly, his gaze was penetrating and she would not have him know the reason for her questions. 'Am I not bound here, and to you, regardless?' His reply fed her hope. 'Marraige can be disolved and Queens can be toppled. The first would require the consent of Hera, who has never given it, the second is at my behest.' He drunk from his goblet and continued. 'I am known for my unchanging nature, wife. I shall not give you up.' His expression was dark and fierce until he saw the naked fear in her eyes. The black look on his face became less so, but his tone was implacable when he spoke again. 'I know what you are thinking of, Lady wife. Your mother may try to take you from me. Heed my warning, gentle Persephone, it is not wise to take that which belongs to Hades, but I would have you surrender your very soul to me by your own will.' She cast her gaze down to her plate and ran her finger around the edge. A pattern of flowers and wheat was painted onto the rim. It had been made for her, a silver plate for springtime. Kore pushed it away, she could not banquet as a Queen whilst her mother would be in agonies. 'Will you spare my dear mother for doing as she must? It would be against her very nature to not seek me out and try to bring me home again.' His eyes were flinty, reminding her of the obsidian that now cloaked the nether-sun. 'Persephone. You are home. Your mother will feel my displeasure should she try to take you. As for you, my Queen. Wander anywhere you please in your kingdom...but do not venture to cross the Styx without me. You would not like the consequences of my anger any more than I should like to impose them, but do not mistake that for unwillingness. I have you, and I shall certainly keep you.' Hope faded once more to a gossamer thin thread and tears burned in Persephone's eyes. Her throat closer and her voice would not obey her. She settled for a nod to her unbending husband and concentrated on skinning a peach. Queen Persephone, looking back, would often say that those first days of banquetting were a strange, thrumming, blur. The music was loud, the dancing primal and the drink stronger than anything she had ever had. Certainly, she drank too much wine-- but rather thought that the ever watchful eyes of Hades were headier than the effects of strong drink. He carried her off to his bed, after the feasting was over, kissing her mouth as the shades were changing the jewels around the nether-sun for a riot of reds and pinks. They had created a glorious sunrise in honour of her marraige and all Persephone could think of, as her husband loomed over her, was that the very light around them looked like blood. After that, she was Kore no more. Hope you enjoyed it! Please let me know if you did.:-) The Blossomming of Springtime: Chapter 4 Persephone sat, arrayed in splendid robes, beside Hades in the cavernous throne room. The sheer number of matters brought before the judgement of the king was incredible. Hades dealt justice swiftly and tirelessly. Occaisionally, a pitiful soul would take note of the silent goddess beside the judge and threw themselves on her mercy, hoping for her intervention. When this happened, Hades would gravely turn to his wife and name the price of his mercy. It was usually a kiss or an embrace. Persephone had little enough mercy to spare for the shades who expected her to pay the price for their misdeeds. She had done nothing but exist, and no gentle deity had yet come to alleiviate her suffering. She often wandered the Underworld alone, reluctantly curious about its workings and laws. Hades did not place onerous restrictions on her explorations. He told her to not attempt to cross the wide river Styx and to stay away from Tartarus. She supposed that she was either very cowardly or very sensible, because she had no desire to disobey him. In fact, she was a very obeidient wife, she aceeded to his every request and edict. If he noticed that she did not go beyond that in trying to please him, he did not remark on it but as the days passed she observed that Hades' commands to her became more gently worded, so that they almost sounded like requests. On the thirteenth day of her captivity, Persephone wandered to the farthest reaches of the realm, where the light of the Nether-sun barely reached and the land stretched out empty and desolate. Few shades wandered there, and those that did would not approach the beautiful woman whom Hades had claimed. The unhappy Queen sunk to her knees, disregarding her fine robes and dove her dainty fingers deep into the soil. It was moist and warm and it felt like home. She called to the earth to produce and concentrated on nurturing the tiny seedling that sprouted. Her tears watered the young life and it sprung up. It matured quickly into a tree of some sort, a willow perhaps- but unlike anything she had created before. In her old life, the plants and trees that she had occaisionally formed sprung up joyous and cheerful, reaching up to the bright sky. Not so here. The willow branches drooped and gracefully grew back down to the ground. It looked, she thought, as though it were weeping, and was comforted by the thought. She visited that spot every day, it was as far away from Lord Hades as she could get and, by growing a new tree with each visit, she could number the days of her separation from her mother. By the time Hermes sought an audience with her husband, she had created a woodland of over a hundred trees. She found a strange contentment in the gloom of her wood, the shades of Elysium would sometimes come to see, and then depart --the weeping trees were too sorrowful for their blissful existence to bear. Her favourite tree was her first. It grew tall and strong, but its leaves and branches remained adamantly bowed in sadness, when she rested her head against the rough trunk, Persephone almost felt she had a sympathtic friend. A slave, whose name she had no desire to learn, approached her. 'His Majesty requests that you attend him in the throne room, my Queen. The messenger has come.' Persephone nodded once. In a fit of pique, she shrouded her favoured retreat in a shadowy mist, she preferred not to use the powers that her husband had conferred on her but today she would make an exception. She entered the throne room quietly, to find Hades in deep discussion with Hermes, the messenger god. She knew him by sight and reputation, but had never had cause to speak to him. It was doubtful he would know her. She bowed her head to Hades, respectfully, who stood and extended his hand. 'My Queen,' he murmured, kissing her fingertips. Persephone smiled slightly and turned her curious gaze to the visitor. 'Honoured Hermes. What brings you to my husband's court? Is all well in the world above?' She did not dare speak more than that. Not with her Hades' cold fingers tightening- in a warning- about hers. 'Fair Queen. It is well met, a thousand blessings upon your marraige, my lady.' Hermes looked admiringly at her and she nodded slightly in response to his greeting. The messenger glanced at Hades and something in the Kings face made him avert his eyes from the beauteous goddess before him. 'Alas, Majesties, I bear bad tidings from the earth above. Demeter greives most sorrowfully for her departed child, and hunts high and low for the young maiden. I am charged by mighty Zeus, to seek out any who might have seen her or have news.' In response to this speech, Hades tugged on her hand, bringing Persephone closer to him. He breathed in her ear, 'be silent, sweet wife,' before turning to Hermes and gravely saying, 'has no word been received by the harvest goddess, regarding her daughters safety? Tell me, o fleet footed Hermes, what has been done?' He gathered his queen close to him, bringing her head against his broad shoulder and continued, 'My gracious wife is not to be troubled in this. It is of course, upsetting to one so tender hearted as she.' Hermes stared, as the most ancient of the gods put a hand on the lithe waist of the beautiful woman in his arms. He had not heard of Hades' marraige, not until setting foot in this spendid court and seeing the pair of thrones on the dias. He could not tell whether the young thing was mortal or otherwise. She was lavishly arrayed, with many jewels wound about her neck and arms, lovely arms- he couldn't help but note. All of her was lovely actually, slender and etheral but with such an aura of sadness that Hermes found himself longing to comfort her. He felt the searching gaze of Hades upon him and wisely ended his train of thought. The souls of the Undeworld whispered that Hades' myterious power was so great that he could gather the thoughts of men and examine them. Hermes did not like to risk underestimating him. Hephaistus had recently incurred Hades wrath for some reason and had yet to leave his workshop since. No hammering had been heard within for many days. 'The Lady Demeter has searched every favoured corner that Kore has been, my Lord. The nymphs who were the child's constant companions say only that they were awakened by an earthquake and saw no sign of the girl. Great Poseidon has agreed to search the oceans and her father Zeus, who commands the world above leads the hunt there. He entreats you, my Lord, in a gesture of friendship to search your realms for the girl, Kore. Pity for Demeter! Pity for the lost child!' Hades very deliberately held -the now silently sobbing- Persephone closer to him. 'It is unnessesary, Hermes, for me to search my own kingdom for Demeters offspring. I know well who enters and leaves my lands. There is no maiden called Kore here.' Hermes bowed. 'I thank you, Sire. I shall bear your information back above. Are there any messages you would have me take with me, Your Majesty? Shall I tell the gods of your illustrious marraige, of your kingdoms great wealth and its queen's remarkable beauty?' Hades considered. 'By all means,' he said smoothly. 'Tell them that even the eternal shades in Elysium press their faces into the dust at her approach, that she commands the shadows and can halt the very progression of time. It is a worthy queen that I have crowned.' Hermes bowed. 'And may I take back with me the name of this paragon, o most ancient one?' 'Her name is mine. It is cursed. Extol her virtues and her titles, the Queen of the Underworld, will suffice.' Hermes brows rose at this, but glancing once more at Hades he simply bowed and bid them farewell. He did not linger in Hades' kingdom, but instead flew quickly forth to the world above. Persephone wrenched herself away from her husband and fled from the throne room. If even Hermes could not know that she had been taken, what chance had Demeter to find her and bring her home? She retreated to her wood and did not emerge until sunset. She had underestimated the tenacity of her mother, however. The next time Hermes came, he bore the news that Helios had told Zeus of her capture, having seen it from his high vantage point when he crossed the azure heavens. Hermes stood before Hades and demanded the safe return of Kore. 'My Lord, Demeter grieves. She permits nothing to grow on her beloved earth whilst her daughter is not with her. The world is covered in ice and snow. Mortals are dying, sire. Famine is taking the lives of many. I beseach you, majesty. Return the maiden to her mother, Zeus commands it.' Persephone had only known Hades for half a year, but even she, who avoided him when ever possible, could tell that this was a disastrous speech for Hermes to have to utter. Hades sat, stone-like in his glittering chair, his hand clenching his sceptre. The god was furious. 'So, Demeter neglects her solemn duty and expects to command me with it through Zeus, does she? I have a message for you to take back, boy. Fly swiftly with it. There is no maiden to return. She is mine. Shall I also refuse to do my duty, shall I leave the mortals slain by Demeters treachery on the brink of death, with no release from agony? Think on that before you bring me more messages of insolence. Hades shall war with the earth and the oceans before my wife is taken from here.' Persephone cleared throat. 'Honoured Hermes. I would have you tell my mother that I am safe, if you please. Tell her that Kore is indeed no more, but that Persephone beseaches that she look to her duty, as I must look to mine. Tell her...tell her that my love for her is as it ever was.' Hermes nodded, understanding with the ease of long diplomacy, what was unsaid. 'My Lady, will you not elect to come with me now? Your mother would be overjoyed...' Hades rose to his feet and a black spear appeared in his hand. 'Silence! O theiving Hermes.' Hades, with a swift thrust of his arm let loose the spear to fly over the messengers head. It sailed the length of the court and embedded itself deep into the beaten metal of the doors. 'Ill not shed blood before her, but I will have your head and your heart beneath her feet if you continue.' Persephone, seeing the simmering rage of Hades, stood by him and laid a hand on his. 'Peace, I beg you, my Lord. I would not wish for blood to be spilled on my account.' She spoke to Hermes who was backing away towards the, now ruined, doors. 'Fly, Hermes. I cannot leave this place. Kore is lost.' Hermes fled, his winged sandals making him speed back to the world above. Persephone wondered whether the god would prefer to face the wrath of Zeus or Hades. It was likely that he would face both in a short span of time. Hades wound his arm about her waist and drew her close. 'Sweet wife.' He murmured, his lips ghosting over hers, 'you cannot bear violence. I wonder how your gentle heart must ache to sit beside me so silently, as I condemn the guilty to eternal suffering. Would you intercede if you could, hmm?' She looked up at him. One surprising thing about Hades, for all his humourless gravitas, was that his mind flitted about in a manner that she could not fathom. There seemed to be no logic or straight path between his conversation and his actions. 'I would not be so unwise as to undermine any ruling of yours, my King.' His eyes glitterred like jewels and he swiftly kissed her. 'Come dine with me, Persephone.' was all he said, and he led her to the dining hall. The Queen sat listlessly as he made up a silver platter of fruits for her, her mind was elsewhere, wondering where Demeter was at this moment and what her mother was doing to plan her rescue. It bolstered her spirits a little, to think that now her mother knew of her whereabouts, she would surely come and she ate what was on her plate more eagerly because of it. She picked up a pomegranate, breaking it and pulling out the seeds. The juice spread over her fingers, dark and red. Hades watched her, his own golden platter remaining untouched. Perhaps the food of the dead was not to his liking tonight, he was still and calm, but to his young wife, he seemed almost anxious. She had swallowed half of the seeds before she realised, with a flash of betrayal, the reason for his strange demenour. The pomegranate in her hand fell to the floor and she rose in her distress. 'Hades. What have you done? You have tricked me.' He stood to catch her as she stumbled, but she shied from him. Persephone, desperate, attempted to return the food from her body, with her fingers. Hades--merciless, trecherous and without remorse--grasped her wrist and prised her hand from her throat. 'No, Persephone! Do you hear me? No!' and he held her to him, watching as wept bitter tears of betrayal. She pushed at his chest, trying to free herself. She felt something strange and indefinable shift inside her and knew that he had won. He released her, and looked agitated when she dropped to her knees. She looked blankly up at him, months of repressed anger blazing in her eyes. 'You have decieved me, Hades. You have tricked me into eating the food of the dead. I will never, never forgive you.' She did not shout or rail at him, her words were soft and assured. Her husband reached out hand, hovering above her but not daring to touch. She wondered bitterly why he abstained now. He had never cared for her opinion before, he had even taken her soul without her leave. He crouched beside her crumpled figure. 'Persephone. Zeus would have prevailed on Hera to take you from me. I have spies. I know that she was weakening against him. I cannot, I will not give you up.' Persephone pressed her wet face into her hands. 'Let me go. Send me home to my mother.' she commanded. Her husband closed his eyes, his mouth was pressed closed and he shook his head. She looked up after a moment of silence to see agony on his features. 'I hate you.' She whispered. His eyes flew to hers, shocked disbelief written in them and with a muted cry of grief, Hades turned on the spot and disappeared before her despairing eyes. Persephone, the unwilling Queen, drew all the shadows about her, hiding herself in them. For the first time, the darkness comforted her. Thank you so much for your kind responses. I know its been ages- sorry! She spent the hours of darkness in her woodland, making the fog so thick that she herself could barely make out the shadowy trees. It did not take long for her anger and sense of betrayal to subside and for fear to take its place. What had she been thinking, to speak to Hades so? It mattered not at all that it was the truth; he had power over her. She may be immortal, but she knew very well that she was not immune to pain...and she had seen him callously inflict that often enough in her time as his wife. If only she could erase the memory of his expression when she had told him of her hatred. His ordinarily inscruitable demeanor had become an open book to her for that moment. She had hurt him with her venom, and she found little satisfaction in it- she wished that she did. It was not in her nature to wish pain on anyone. All her life, her mother had taught her to treasure life, to be as gentle with others as she was with her most delicate blooms. Sometimes, she forgot and always felt dreadful for it later. Anger always left her feeling hot and prickly, sick to her stomach and wishing to return to her normal placidity. She leant against a drooping tree, too unsettled to even think of making another sapling spring up. Persephone, absorbed in her turmoiled thoughts, at first failed to notice the tall figure watching her silently from a short distance. The thick fog dissipated around him, but he left the rest of the wood shrouded in darkness. When she looked up and saw him, he approached. 'Husband.' she said in greeting. He bowed stiffly and her brows rose, unseen in the darkness. 'I am to take you to Olympus, Persephone.' Hades spoke, softly. Whatever she might have expected him to say, it had not been that. She looked at him in blank astonishment. The corner of his mouth twisted downwards. 'Zeus wishes to verify your safety. Hera says that our marraige requires her blessing.' His distainful opinion of his sisters boon was clear, and Persephone- for the first time, felt the urge to laugh. She contented herself with a cautious nod. Hades came closer. 'Your mother will be there. It is likely that she will petition my brother for your return.' Hades said it tonelessly, but his wife took silent note of his clenched fingers and drew her own conclusions. 'When?' She enquired, trying not to sound too hopeful. She had insulted him quite enough as it was. He made an impatient gesture with his hand. 'Do you know, little one, that you are the most unfathomable creature I have ever dealt with?' She couldn't help it. A watery chuckle escaped. Hades blinked and explained. 'I seem incapable of divining your thoughts. Your soul is mine, your hand and your body are mine, but the contents of that pretty head are a mystery to me.' Hades came closer to her and put an arm either side of her, leaning against the tree. It reminded her of that first journey in his chariot. 'We leave immediately,' he said, finally answering her question. 'But first, I want something that has eluded me since I first laid eyes on you.' His eyes were level with hers and he was so close, she could feel his breath on her cheek as he spoke. He slowly brought his hand, always graceful- despite its latent strength, to rest on the skin of her shoulder. It was heavy and warm against her skin. She felt his power swirl about them the moment before he concentrated it on her. Her husband dropped his voice to a whisper, 'Sweet wife, my very bones ache for a crumb of your affection. You come from the warm world above, having basked in the sunlight all your life...but you spare no warmth for me. I have been cold, Persephone, as ice, for so long.' Persephone heaved great gulping breaths of air as Hades pressed close to her. She could not look away, could not break the burning gaze of her husband. She felt his power seep into her body from his fingertips, knew the very moment control was wrested from her and in that moment launched herself at him, suddenly filled with such fierce desperation that she could hardly think. She wound her arms about his neck, needing to be nearer still as she kissed him with a passion that she did not know she possessed. He groaned and crushed her to him, she felt the rough bark of the tree to her back and the coolness of his plated armour to her chest. A fire raged through her body, she was wild for his kisses and in that moment felt as free and incandescently happy as she ever done in her life. When she wound her fingers into the thick, oiled locks at his nape, he gave a strangled cry- releasing her and stepped back. She slid down against the tree to the floor, boneless and unable to stand. The controlling power of Hades that had overtaken her soul left as abruptly as it had come and still she could not will her trembling to cease and cold reason to return. Persephone sat, wide eyed and panting as Hades flung himself to rest against a nearby tree. For a treacherous moment, even with the certainty that he had just used his treacherously gained power over her in order to awaken her passion, all she wanted was to beg him to return to her-to kiss him again. She fisted the smooth silk of her gown in her hands and tried very hard not to watch the King as he so obviously fought an internal battle for self control. He rested his forehead against the trunk of the willow and would not look at her. The thick fog that shrouded the forest had receded somewhat and she could clearly see the agony writ across his features. How was it, she wondered, that his own control could have been so shattered by his manipulation of hers? Eventually, he raised his head to look at her and once more she could not read his expression. 'Come, my Lady Wife. We must away, to Olympus.' He stretched out a hand to aid her rising from the ground and she hesitated, afraid that if she touched his skin she would burn up all over again. He dropped his arm. 'Persephone...I'll not use my power over you again, fear not. I only...' He broke off, seemingly at a loss for words. 'I will not use your soul so, not again.' -------------- They rode in great state and ceremony to Olympus, Queen Persephone stood beside her husband in his chariot, suitably crowned and begowned. The three Furies flanked their chariot and Persephone, after staring at them in horrified fascination for several minutes was glad when Hades ordered them to keep their distance from them. The flapping of their immense wings created a strong wind, causing Persephone's hair and Hades' cloak to whip about behind them as they travelled. When they reached the great white palace of Zeus, commencing their walk upward, Persephone felt her stomach roil in anticipation. She would see her own dear mother in moments! Oh to feel Demeters safe arms around her once more, so different to the embrace of Lord Hades. She tried once more, to put the kiss in the willow wood out of her mind, but every now and then her husband's elbow would brush her upper arm as they walked and she remembered once again. A great fanfare of trumpets announced their arrival and Persephone heard the messenger, Mercury cry out. 'Harken, o great gods of Olympus! The great king and queen of the Underwold approach. All honour to them.'Persephone felt the eyes of the assembled gods on her as they approached Zeus, she would have curtseyed then but Hades hand on her waist stayed her. Hades gave a very slight bow to Zeus and a cool nod to Hera, who rose to greet them. 'Brother!' Boomed Zeus, his greeting clear and confident. 'We welcome you once more.' The ruler of the heavens turned his bearded face slightly to look at Persephone, he smiled. 'My Lady. We bid you welcome also, the Lady Demeter has been most anxious to see you once more.' Almost as soon as her name had left Zeus' lips, the harvest goddess broke free of the crowd that held her back. In a flurry of white robes, she was before her daughter. Demeter did not so much as glance at the forbidding figure of her brother, did not pause at the sight of the crown and rich gown her child wore. The mother opened her arms and with sobbing, heartfelt sigh of relief Persephone stepped into them. The women clung to each other, heedless of the multitude of eyes upon them. They did not see Hera raise a finger to dismiss the crowd, leaving the five of them left alone in the throne room. Persephone tucked her head beneath Demeter's chin and rested her cheek on her chest. Demeter was thinner, perhaps but still smelled of warmth and sunshine, that scent that meant comfort and safety. How good, how joyful it was to be in those beloved ams again! At length, Persephone gently drew away to an arms length and looked at Demeter. What she saw worried her. The fresh, beauteous face that smiled on the prosperity of the mortals was now withered and gaunt. 'Mother! Oh my dear one! What has happened to you?' cried the young Queen. Demeter's smile was brittle. 'A curse. I left the world to famine and drought, hunting for you. The mortals pleaded for Zeus' intervention and when I refused to return to my duty...he punished me. My immortality cannot be touched, of course...but my eternal youth? Alas, I grow old now, as do the mortals. Oh, do not weep so, Kore! You are returned to me, I would bear a hundred such evils, to have you with me.' Hades spoke, derision dripping from each word. 'She is not returned to you, sister. She is mine. Wives, once wed, do not return to the home of their maidenhood. It is not the way of things. I know that you have attempted to persuade Hera to disolve the match- can you imagine the evil that might spring from such a decision? That a bond may be broken and rent assunder? What chaos would spring up amongst the mortals.' Hades, reached out and clasping Persephone's shoulder, turned her about and brought her to his side once more. At his touch she tensed, once more the urge to kiss him surfaced. She wanted to reach up and wind her fingers into the hairs that curled into his nape, to bring his head down to hers and... Blushing she recollected herself, looking to the Goddess of Marraige, who was nodding in agreement with what her husband had said. 'Indeed, husband' said Hera lightly, 'enough mischeif is made already by marraiges being forsaken- if a precedent were set that they might be done away with altogether...it would be disastrous. Demeter must give up this madness and instead find solace in her duty. The child would have married regardless at some point anyway, it simply comes sooner than our sister had hoped.' 'No!' declared Demeter. 'No. I should never have let her be at the cruel mercies of a man. I would have kept her with me, always.' she broke down, weeping. Persephone edged towards her mother and laid a hand on her shoulder. 'Mother...I...I have not met with cruelty. His Majesty has not injured me.' To her distress she saw that her mother did not heed her words, only moaned and hid her head in her hands. Zeus sighed. 'This must be resolved! It can not go on as it is. The mortals are dying. Sister, will you not return to your harvest and your crops, knowing that your daughter is safe?' He recieved only a mutinous glare and a shake of the head in reply and turned to Hades. 'Brother. Will you release your Queen back to her mother's care? Have you compassion for the mortals?' Hades bared his teeth. 'You ask me that? You would dare? I'll not release her. You permit your mistress too much liberty if she thinks to neglect her duty and gain from it! Hear me, brother KIng. If anyone tries to take what is mine, I will not rest until I see them destroyed.' Persephone looked at her hands. She did not want that. She would not, could not wish for such violence to occur if she were gain her freedom. Her mother was wrong to inflict such great suffering on others, she loved her dearly for trying to bring her home to the bright happy meadow, but could not condone such widespread pain. How she wished, whole heartedly, that there were someway to assuage both of them. 'Perhaps there is, noble Queen.' An eerie trio of voices spoke from behind he, as one. Persephone gasped and Zeus strode forward to greet the Fates. Three women, old and huddled together with tattered cloaks drawn over their heads. They ignored the mighty King of the gods and peered, squinting at Persephone. 'A true and noble thought. She is fated to rule and fated to be both wife and daughter.' The three aged crones cackled together. 'It is a question of how.' Zeus, eager for a solution, asked, 'can there be an easy solution? How is it to be accomplished?' The three Fates turned their attention to him. 'Easy? Not so. Not for any of them, least of all for a Queen who commands time, she must be subject to it- must come and go at its passing. The solution can neither please all, nor injure any.' Hades quite pale and seeming to understand the strange, riddled speach of the women, murmured calmly, 'If that is the answer, the earth can expect to feel my wrath when she is not by my side.' The women bowed. 'That is so, Great One. Your judgement is already written in the stars of the future. Nothing can be as it was.' The three joined hands and addressed the company. Even Demeter had risen from the floor and waited in anticipation for their pronouncement. 'She who is both springtime and destruction, shall remain with her Lord for six months of each year, then must return to the light of the world above to the arms of Demeter, until such time as her destiny is put into her own hands.' With that astonishing declaration, the strange trio left the great hall as swiftly and as noiselessly as they had entered it. Thank you to those of you who have left a comment, its really nice to see that people are enjoying this. Its drought or drown with me, isnt it? Hopefully I'll be able to post more regularly now. Persephone lay on soft green grass, gazing up at the sky. Nymphs surrounded her but their merry chatter could not distract her from the fascination of the fluffy white clouds that passed overhead. It was an idle occupation, to spend hours on end just looking and smelling and...existing. Three months had passed since the Fates had given their verdict. It was decided that the Queen of the Underworld should commence her time with her mother immediately. It was the spee diest way, said Zeus, of ending the mortal suffering that Demeter had inflicted. Hades had looked sour when the harvest goddess had shot him a triumphant look over Persephone's head. They never spoke of him, not even when he sent messengers and gifts to the world above to ask how she fared. On the occaisions that message bearers entered her home, Demeter would absent herself and leave the diplomacy to her daughter. The goddess of the harvest made no effort to disguise her hatred of King Hades in those first days, she well nigh tore the fine robes and exquisite jewels off her child- all the while condemning the Lord of the dead for daring to take her. Persephone had remained silent, allowing Demeter to gently clothe her in the bright, beautiful cottons that she had always worn. The fabric felt strange to her, after so long spent in silk and fine lawn, perhaps she would have to become reaccustomed to it. She knew that her mother needed this, to brand her as her own again, after having searched frantically for her. She slept in her mother's arms that first night. Demeter held her close, as though to ward off Hades, should he come in the night to take her back below the earth. Persephone could not say that she missed her husband, she was too glad, too happy to be back with her mother to even think of it. Knowing that she would have to return to his side was a fact that she pushed to the back of her mind, she deliberately did not think of it. In fact, were it not for the frequent gifts that he sent and the fearful reverence that all -except her mother- now treated her with, Persephone could almost forget that she was a Queen, that she had slept in the bed of a King. She admired the beautiful gifts her husband sent and quietly put them away so as not to distress her mother. A nymph had had asked her once, within Demeter's hearing, how long she had left before she must go back to the land of the dead. The expression of blind panic in Demeter's eyes had hurt Persephone and she had not objected to the vines that sprang up from the fertile earth, choking the breath from the foolish companion. Her time as Hades' Queen had given her a sense of justice that balanced out her compassion. She was not the same as she was, she would not entirely wish to be. Three months. In three months time, she would come face to face with Hades again. Was he as daunting as she remembered? Would his kisses reawaken that terrifying fire that consumed her, that burning, dreadful heat that threatened to consume her so that she hardly knew herself? A nymph's persistant calling interrupted her reverie. 'Your Majesty! My lady!' 'What is it?' she murmured. 'A mortal man approaches! He has the look of detirmination about him.' Her curiousity aroused, Persephone sat up and looked across the meadow, squinting her eyes against the sun. A grecian fellow walked steadily towards the group, a lyre slung across his back, his jaw set and eyes focused upon the young Queen. He sank to his knees before, his bent head level with hers. He did not speak but waited for her to acknowledge him. The nymphs tittered. Persephone raised her hand for silence. She felt, rather strongly, that this wretched mortal should be grovelling before a regal goddess on a throne rather than a slightly grubby and barefooted girl lying on the ground. She dismissed the thought however, and decided that her bearing would simply have to be queenly enough to make up for the rest of it. 'What is your name, sir?' 'I am Orpheus, noble queen.' 'And what is it that you want of me?' she queried. He did not look up, did not move from where he knelt. 'I would have your majesty hear my song, and take pity on my suffering heart.' It was a reasonable enough request, she supposed and it was a rather less lazy occupation than staring at clouds and trying not to think about Hades. 'Well then, Orpheus,' she said softly, 'strike at your instrument and lift up your voice, my compassion is dependant on your skill.' He shifted then, seating himself comfortably, with the lyre held tenderly in his hands. His hands carressed the strings for a moment before he drew breath and begun his song. Persephone was enthralled as he opened his mouth to sing. Truly, this mere mortal had been blessed by the gods. His voice was as a rippling waterful, smooth and powerful and masterfully weilded. He sung of his love for Euridice, his wife. He wept in the telling of it, so great was his passion for her. Truth was evident in every part of his tale. Orpheus' compelling music wove its own story, of wicked satyrs stealing his love away from him- of his frantic search and his despair at the finding of the pit of vipers that ended poor Euridice's life. Not an eye was dry as the last chords of his mournful tune faded away. Somewhere, a far off a bird chirped unhappily. Even the animals wept with this man. Persephone stood up, blinking back tears. 'Very well, Orpheus- your sad tale has moved me. I would wish to help you. I will plead your case to my husband.' she grimaced at the thought of what her mother might say, that she was even considering visiting the Underworld when she was not obliged to. She pitied the bard though, and wished to aid him, even if it meant facing Hades sooner than necessary. She waved away the gasping nymphs impatiently and pinned Orpheus with a glare. 'Have you courage as well as song? We must descend to the place of the dead, it is a realm that mortals rarely return from. Your bravery will be put under great strain, if you do not do as you are required to, you will have to suffer the consequences alone, I will not petition King Hades twice on your behalf.' The man quaked visibly at her dire warning, but nodded in response. 'I will do whatever I must to see my wife again, as any man would do.' Persephone steeled herself. 'Well then. Come. We have a long journey ahead.' She sent a dryad off to her mother, bearing the news that she would return by sunrise the next morning and the pair set off. She knew, from her time there, that there were many entrances to the Underworld- but precious few exits- especially if you were unfortunate enough to be mortal. It seemed that the most likely option today, would be to visit Acheron and its deep flowing river, to seek the ferryman that could bear them below the earth. Persephone did not relish the journey, but her heart was moved by the great pathos with which the poet spoke. She supposed that if she were ever to want her own sad tale told to the world, it would be Orpheus that ought to tell it. Not even the great Apollo plucked at his lyre with as much skill as this grieving husband. He entertained her as they travelled, with poems and tales that amused her immensely, she even found herself laughing lightly at Orpheus' accounting of the birth of Athene- she'd had no idea that the mortals possessed such strange imaginations. When they at last reached the banks of the Acheron, Orpheus' smooth voice came to an abrupt halt. Shades paced the shores moaning and wailing for peace and for passage across. They parted before the Queen and her quaking shadow. The ferryman bowed low when she raised her hand to him. 'I seek passage to the Underworld, along with this man.' She said, gesturing to Orpheus, who had gone quite white with his fear. 'Will you bear us across?' The silent, skeletal boatman simply bowed again. As with the first time she crossed the river, she felt his eyes on her the entire time- watching her from beneath the cowl of his hood. The boat glided smootly across the still, dark waters. Orpheus grew more and more tense beside her, his eyes fixed on the black river. She did not know what he saw in those waters, did not care to know- her own anxiety mounted as they approached the far shore, judging by the light, the first jewels of sunset were being hung. What would her husband say, would he be displeased at her presence here? Championing the cause of a bard? What would she say? They walked up to the palace, it was a winding, dusty climb, the dead bowed low at the sight of her, even without her royal robes and crown- perhaps she did not look so very common after all. She glanced down at her bare little toes peeping out from the grass stained hem of her chiton and let out of soft snort of self derision. She was fooling herself if she thought her appearance was in the least bit queenly. It was a problem that she would need to address once this adventure was done, she may be a wife for half a year and Springtime for the other but there must be some compromise to be reached in the matter of her dress. These thoughts occupied her attention as they passed through the great doors of the palace and into the throne room. It was brimming with petitioners, all begging for mercy from the King. Hades sat on his splendid throne, arrayed in a fine robe of black and gold- he looked as forbidding as he ever had. Perhaps more so. He looked up from the scroll he read from as Persephone, gesturing to Orpheus to keep up, walked through the crowd of souls that parted before them. She congratulated herself on the brief flash of shock that crossed his features- a slight widening of dark eyes and a twitch of the thick brows. She held her head high as she approached the dias and made her respectful curtsey. Her husband tossed aside the scroll and leant back on his throne, his expression was carefully neutral and his hooded eyes glittered. There was no point in denying to herself that physically speaking, he was handsome. His dark hair gleamed in the evening light, Persephone felt dreadfully inadequate in contrast to his regality- she flushed lightly as she remembered that she probably still had flowers woven into her locks. 'My Queen has returned to me. Will she not assume her rightful place by my side,' he drawled, flicking a finger to her empty seat, 'or does she seek my favour as my subject?' She didn't understand exactly what he meant, perhaps he merely wanted her to acknowledge him as her husband, but she understood that her next words would be important. His attitude and demenour may look casual but the hand clutching the diamond studded arm of his throne was white with the force he gripped with. 'My Lord husband...' She tentatively began, 'I would ask for private speech with your majesty, if I may.' She bit her lip. Hades did not move, did not take his eyes off his wife. Eventually, he lifted a finger slightly and softly said, 'As you command, my queen.' He raised his voice slightly to command the court to depart, Orpheus fidgeted beside Persephone until she curtly commanded him to wait outside the doors. Persephone heard the echoing clang of the doors closing behind sweet Orpheus. Alone with Hades, she was about to open her mouth to begin her petition on the mortals' behalf when Hades flung himself forwards from where he sat. She shut her mouth with a snap. A few long strides brought him close to her, towering over her and with his strong arms, he pulled her closer yet. 'Persephone,' he murmured, cupping her face in his hands and dragging his cool, firm lips accross her brow, 'tell me why you have come.' (See the end of the chapter for notes.) Persephone made her way to the double set of doors that stood closed at the far end of her husband's court. Cautious excitement bubbled up in her throat, perhaps her husband was not so completely unbending as she had once believed. She touched the handle, an onyx carving of a serpent with glittering sapphire eyes, preparing to wrench it open with all her might but was surprised when the door swung free at a gentle push.Orpheus, predictably, was white faced and anxiously waiting on the other side. Persephone smiled at him, relieved for his sake that there was hope.'Come forward, blessed Orpheus. My Lord Husband, the unbending King Hades has agreed to hear and consider your case- bring your lyre.' And with that, she turned on her toes and made her way back to the waiting King.His countenance, upon Orpheus' greeting and obeisance, could not have been less encouraging. To the widowers credit, his voice did not desert him in his fear and his hands, that had trembled visibly when he brushed the sweat from his brow, were steady and sure as he plucked at the lyre.Mournful notes filled the cavernous hall, Orpheus himself wept as he played- still Hades' face remained as hard as the diamonds that decorated his royal seat. When the last echoing note of Orpheus' plea faded into nothingness, Hades turned to his wife.'The mortal makes his case well,' he said lowly, 'you are not impervious to such tragedies then? You would have me permit a soul to leave my domain? I have never done so before.' Hades reached out his hand to her face and with a fingertip, traced the course of a tear down her soft cheek. The tear ran down to her jaw, Persephone held her breath as Hades, spellbound, watched it fall to her chest. Neither moved. A discordant, loud twang came from the man awaiting judgement and their majesties turned abruptly to regard him as he finished setting down his lyre. Hades scowled at Orpheus and the bard instinctively dropped to his knees. The King of the Underworld rose from his throne and moved to tower over his, still seated, wife. He bent to murmur in her ear, his lips a breath away from brushing against the lobe. 'If I do this,' his voice was deep and gentle- like that of a lover, 'If I let him take back his wife, to please you, what are you willing to give me.'His Queen did not shrink away as she would have wished to, they were under observation and it would not help the cause of this poor man if she spurned mighty Hades' in front of him. She tilted her face towards him slightly, but kept her eyes on Orpheus- whose trembling had returned, he was about to lose his nerve.'There is nothing, Lord Hades, that I have, that you have not given me. I have no favours to grant that are not already yours to command.' she whispered smoothly, he withdrew slightly, at that and she carried on, pleading. 'If there is something in particular that you would have me give, your majesty has but to name it. Take pity on this poor man, husband- I pity him, please...give him the chance at happiness.'Hades reached down and clasped her hand in both of his. 'Look at me.' He commanded, 'My compassion is not so absent as you might think, I will do this for you- but if I do, my price is yours to bear.' He raised her hand up to his unsmiling mouth, his eyes on hers. She stared at him, wide eyed. She raised her brows in enquiry, Hades turned over the hand in his and dropped another kiss on her palm. Persephone shivered. 'It is simply this, when the time comes for to return to my side, you must do so as my willing wife.'She froze, ice encased her heart once more and, after the uncomfortable heat and flutterings that he had very recently aroused in her, she welcomed the clarity of the cold. Turning her face away she fixed her eyes on the unclaimed hand that lay idly in her lap. 'Are you asking me to walk down into your kingdom of my own accord, sir, or for me to fall in love with you?'An unyielding finger was pressed under her chin and her gaze forced to meet his once more. His eyes glittered, hard and as stern as ever they had been but his voice caught a little, as he spoke her name. 'Persephone, I will demand nothing else from you that you cannot willingly give. I want you to come home to me, your husband, without forcing me to wrest you from your mother's arms.'Her expression must have communicated her disbelief. He would not take what she did not wish to give him? He was Hades, there was nothing of hers that he did not own, that he had not already taken. Persephone set her jaw, she had promised aid to this mortal who, unlike the stone hearted individual before her, was capable of deep abiding love. Hades' Queen would finish what she started.'I have already demonstrated my willingness to return to your realm uncoerced, Majesty. What you ask is not so very great a price.' she said, coolly, 'You have my word, I shall come back to this realm without troubling you to fetch me.'Her acceptance of his terms did not, apparently, delight King Hades for he did not look in the least bit victorious. Hades dipped his head in a curt nod, and for the first time, turned to speak to Orpheus.'My Lady Wife has interceded for yours, mortal. You are to have the chance to return your wife to the land of the living. Harken to my words, Orpheus. Turn around, walk from here back up to the world above. Look neither to the left, nor to the right and on no account must you turn around. Euridice is behind you. If you look back into the land of the dead, there will be no second reprieve from me. Her Majesty has agreed to pay the price of my mercy, if you squander it- render it worthless- my wrath will fall on you. Go.'Persephone stood quickly. 'I will bear you company partway, Orpheus- I must return above also.' She curtseyed to Hades, 'I bid you a temporary farewell, my Lord. I will come back...willingly.' To her surprise, he smiled faintly. 'I do not doubt your word, Lady. Farewell, then.'Persephone stared blankly at him, for a moment, marvelling at how even the slightest softening of his face made him impossibly handsome. The unwelcome train of thought made her smile nervously back and hurry after Orpheus and the gliding glimmer of light that followed him.They walked in silence to the river, Orpheus was clutching his lyre so tightly that his fingers turned white from the pressure. Persephone tried to encourage him. 'Have faith, faithful Orpheus- your love is behind you, here is where we part. I will go on ahead of you, remain here and wait for the return of the ferryman. Do not look anywhere but onward! Do not waste your chance!'Orpheus, his eyes never leaving the point of light in the far distance, smiled tremulously. 'I owe you a very great debt, o gentle Queen! I will sing ballads in praise of your beauty and mercy until my dying day.'Persephone let out the ghost of a laugh. 'Perhaps not, mortal- it is best not to praise the fairness of one woman when your wife shadows behind you. There is one thing you may do for me, bard. Tell the tale of my abduction, sing of the resolution that the Fates dictated. Do not let the world forget that such a goddess as Kore existed, even though I may yet forget. Promise me, Orpheus, and your debt to me is forgiven.''My lady! Yes. I promise, I will not forget.'Persephone's shoulders sagged in relief, if the silver tongued Orpheus were to tell her sad story, the world would remember forever, she was sure of it. It was important, she felt, in these times of great upheaval and change, that her past be known. She was no longer 'Kore' and she could not be spoken of by the cursed name 'Persephone'. She had been fearful that she might fade into nameless obscurity if the truth were not known.'Well then, Orpheus, I wish you well. Keep your courage, she is close by you- if you do not falter, your happiness is attainable.' She looked behind him to Euridice, whose form and features were becoming clearer as she neared the entrance to Hades' realm. There was no expression to be seen on the womans' face yet, it was all an indistinct blur- but the shade raised her hand and Persephone knew instinctively, that it meant gratitude. The thanks lightened her heavy heart and she felt glad that someone so worthy should have their hearts desire.The ferryman bore the Queen back across the river and this time instead of feeling unnerved by his watchfulness, she lifted her chin and looked calmly back at him. She may be barefoot and clad like a common maiden, but she felt every inch a queen when the boatman turned his head and nervously averted his gaze. It was a petty victory, perhaps.Persephone, once more under Zeus' vast skies, saw that the stars were flung across the heavens and that Selene's moon shone brightly down upon her. The night was clear and warm, it would not be long before sweet Dawn brought morning to the world above. Walking home across fields of corn, skirting the sleepy houses that dotted the countryside, Persephone felt free. It was not often that she was truly alone, neither her mother nor her husband were likely to let her roam either world as she pleased, she relished the precious fragment of liberty that she had. She was smiling by the time she approached her mother's meadow, she saw Demeter waiting anxiously- looking out for her return and she sped up to meet her.Demeter scolded her daughter for going to see 'that man,' and Persephone, although trying very hard to understand her dear mother's worry, could not help but bristle slightly. She was the Queen of the Underworld, she had already faced the most terrifying thing imaginable, abduction by King Hades. What did Demeter think could happen to her here? That evening, she removed and twisted up her white gown, putting it aside to be washed in the stream. Perhaps tomorrow, she could think about weaving some new dresses- that would be to her liking and not given to her by a mother or husband. It might be possible to find something regal enough for her position and daughterly enough for Demeter. Humming softly to herself, Persephone settled down to watch the sunrise, so very different from the artifice of the new day in Hades' kingdom; not more beautiful necessarily, just different.She could find a sort of contentment in this odd life she had, this divided life in which she was both wife and daughter but never at the same time. She realised, with a start that she was not afraid to return to her husband when the time came, partially because there was an end to look forward to but also because he had treated her with consideration today. The dreaded Hades had upturned an eternity of precedent in order to please her, a slip of a girl who had no real importance, not even to the feeble minded mortals. Just the thought of it made her shake her head in absolute astonishment. The next chapter of this is already written and just needs editing, which I might have time to do after Christmas. Thank you for the lovely, supportive comments that you have left, it really does make a huge difference to how I feel about settling down to write. Oh and Marquesa, a couple of people have mentioned that you directed them to this...thank you so much. Thank you so much for all of your very kind responses! I'm not sure how its happened but my favourite story of mine, seems to be gaining interest! I'm sorry about the spacing in the last chapter, the lovely people at A03 are going to sort it out I think. Paragraphs seem to be working today.:) The remaining months of her time with Demeter flew by. It was plain to Persephone that her mother began to grieve her absence even before she left the happy, sunlit meadow. The weather in that last week, turned cooler and the fresh green leaves that adorned the forest trees began to wither and turn to browns and reds- nature mourned with Demeter. Persephone understood that anticipatory grief, even as it frustrated that her mother grew more morose- she wanted to enjoy what time they had left together. They breakfasted together, one morning. Worshippers had left beautiful, plaited loaves of bread at the temple and they ate it in silence under the bright warm sun. Once they had finished eating, Demeter reached out to take her daughter's hand, playing with the slender fingers. 'It has brought me such joy, my darling, to have you here with me. For a while...I feared that I should never see you again- I feared that somehow you had perished, alone and away from me.' The younger goddess laid a gentle hand on Demeter's arm. 'I have been happy to be home with you, mother. I was not in any grave peril, in those days away from you.' She paused and bit her lip, considering her next words. 'Mother. Dear Mother, you...you will look after the earth while I am gone, will you not? I shall come home in half a year. The mortals, dearest, they are so...so weak.' Demeter frowned. 'Do you lecture me on my duty, Kore? Will you not miss me as much as I will mourn you?' She dropped the little hand and rose, agitated. 'Never mind, it was a foolish question, of course you could not- you cannot possibly understand the love of a mother. Hear me, my daughter. Until you come home I will not pour bounty on the earth- it shall be as frozen and dormant as my poor broken heart.' Persephone stood also, brushing the crumbs from her dress. 'Mother! You cannot be so cruel! People would starve, even though you know that I will be safe, that I will come back to you. Why?' Demeter whirled on her, her colour high and her eyes brimming with tears. 'Safe? With that man? The man who took your girlhood, your person and who knows what else from you? From me.' Persephone smiled wryly. 'I think that there would be few who would seek to harm that which belongs to Hades, mother. He is known for his jealousy over that which is his; and I am, after all, his wife. I don't suggest that his reasons for keeping me safe are as pure or as beautiful as yours, no one can love me as you do mother. Please, I don't wish to fight- let us enjoy these last few days.' Demeter smiled sadly and opened her arms. Persephone stepped into them and rested her cheek on her mother's shoulder. What she did not say to her mother was that, after talking with the nymphs who kept her company much of the time, she had come to understand that Hades, although she had not realised it at the time, had been gentle with her in a way that not all men were with women. She was grateful for that, and for the first time had wondered if her father had treated her mother with the violent passion that some of the nymphs seemed to think was common. It was not a subject she would ever raise, there were somethings that were best left well alone. She felt Demeter straighten her shoulders and stepped back from her. The harvest goddess held her at arms length and looked at her fondly. 'You are right of course, my love. When did you become so brave? Come now, turn about for me- I wish to see your latest new gown.' Laughingly, Persephone obliged- turning this way and that as instructed. She had thought long and hard about the matter of her dress. It had seemed wrong, somehow to dress as she had done in her innocence, but at the same time- she could not very well wander about the countryside dressed in the royal robes and jewels that Hades had provided. She invoked quite enough fear in those who encountered her as it was, Persephone had no desire to terrorize people. In the end, she had settled for a few gowns that were the colour of jewels and of a simple elegant design. They suited her she felt, and when she put them on was quite content with her choice. It was nice to decide for herself what to wear. Demeter had always supplied her clothes in her innocence and then Hades had arrayed her as a pampered queen. In these gowns, she was not clothed as either the dread Queen of the Underworld or as Springtime, but simply as herself. It was...liberating. The day came when she had to return to the world below, the sun had risen on a changed world that morning. The leaves had fallen to the ground just as surely as Demeter's tears had fallen from her bright eyes. Persephone donned a light cloak that was the colour of polished emeralds and kissed her mother sweetly. She had said a soft farewell to the nymphs who had borne her company for many hours and set off towards the dark River Acheron. She did not, could not, look back at her mother as she walked away- to do so would be to falter and she would not break her promise to Hades, that she would return willingly to his side. As she approached her destination, being just a short way off, two men fell into step with her- flanking her. One looked vaguely familiar and she stopped short to look at him, trying to puzzle out where she had seen this face before. He was clearly either a god or descended from them, no mere mortal sported such a face or figure. The man, misinterpreting her curious gaze, flashed her a charming, easy smile. 'Fair lady, your humble servants beg your favour.' 'Who are you?' She asked lightly, 'I feel I have seen you before, but your companion never. Speak then, friend.' The golden haired man grinned widely at this, like a hunter who had just caught his prey. 'You do me great honour, my lady- to even remember my face. I am Pirithous, we dined together at your presentation on Mount Olympus. This is Theseus, he bears me company on my difficult quest.' Something like foreboding tickled at the back of Persephone's neck. 'What manner of quest do you undertake, honourable Pirithous?' She responded, setting off again at a quicker pace. Once more that smile. The golden haired Theseus dropped back, out of her eyeline and she turned to keep him in sight. 'Simply the finding of a wife who is worthy of me, my lady.' Persephone frowned at the arrogance, whilst turning her back on Pirithous, who circled her -like a vulture- and simultaneously trying to keep track of the quick, sly movements of his friend. One stood behind her and one in front and she was ready to cry out in alarm when a sack came over her head. She struggled. Kicking out with her legs and feeling the pain of a successful kick shooting up her ankle. A club or some blunt weapon was swung at her head and stunned her. The poor, frightened girl dropped to the ground in a heap and rough rope was wound tightly, cruelly around her wrists. She heard Pirithous' soft laughter and Theseus' deep voice urging him to hurry up and drag her away from the open country. Her head ached, her foot hurt but she opened her mouth and screamed as loudly as she could. The careless fools had not gagged her, mercifully. Theseus swore and clamped a hand over her mouth, above the hessian sacking that blocked her vision, she twisted and writhed in his grasp, breaking free and wailing once more. 'Hades! Hades! Help me, husband, please!' 'Shut her up, will you? If we get caught, we are doomed. For goodness sakes, Pirithous! Why didn't we knock her out first?' She was suddenly thrust forward, throwing her off balance and once more a club was swung at her head. The blow struck true and pain exploded in her head. Persephone concentrated on taking deep breaths, trying desperately to remain conscious. Falling to the ground once more, she vaguely heard a shout of alarm- she could not guess from whom- and the frantic flapping of wings. Persephone, dizzied and sick with fright, felt claws dig into her shoulders and was all of a sudden lifted high. In her confusion, she doubted her senses, was she being carried through the air or had that second blow knocked all sense and reason from her head? She could see nothing through the sack and the air she breathed tasted acrid and foul. She fought still, for consciousness- hoping that if she could only remain awake, perhaps there might be some hope of escape for her. She was once more dropped, a short while later, after being swung about dreadfully. She heard muffled voices speaking, but could not make out the words or even who might be talking. If only she did not faint! Her face felt hot and wet and she knew that the liquid that ran into her eyes was her own blood. A mortal would certainly have perished by now. The sack was lifted off her and the Queen closed her eyes against the blood that was flowing, too freely, into them. She snapped them open again when she heard the resounding bellow of rage from who ever had freed her from it. Hades. The waters of the River Styx lapped against the shore that she had been dropped on. Her husband stood; dark robed and furious, with the rough sack still in his hand. Hades seemed bigger, darker somehow- she was reminded of the images behind his throne, depicting him as a fearsome warrior. Two of the Furies still had their talons in the shoulders of her would be abductors, Tisiphone, who had carried her, crouched nearby- awaiting Hades' command. 'Take them to Tartarus- keep them alive.' he spat out the words, all somber regality forgotten. The god who ruled over the dead was in the grips of a beastly anger, such had never before been seen. He was snarling, like a feral animal at the fools who had tried to take his queen as they were borne aloft by gleeful Erinyes. Hades reached down and lifted her up, his chariot stood by and she remembered the last time she had been carefully taken up this hill, after an abduction. Persephone clung to Hades this time, had she not done so, she was sure that she would faint or vomit. He was stone like in his solidity, a safe anchor to depend on for strength- she thought as she slipped her arms about his waist without even a hesitation. She tried to wipe the blood out of her eyes with her cloak, which was probably now ruined, she thought irrelevantly, but gave up. What she needed was a large basin of hot water and a soft cloth. Then bed. She was unused to feeling tired, goddess as she was, and she knew that her injuries were grievous by the fatigue that spread through her. Gods were almost impossible to kill, but if seriously injured relied heavily on the healing power of sleep to make them well again. Persephone closed her eyes against Hades' strong shoulder and remained thus until he set her down on his bed. He stared at her, seemingly devoid of words his chest heaving with the effort of self control. A servant entered, bearing a bowl of steaming water, sweetly scented with fragrant oils. Hades waved the girl away and himself set to work dipping a piece of creamy silk into the water. Persephone lay still and docile as her husband tenderly washed her face and bound up her wounds. He seemed to recollect himself, the closer he got to completing his task and by the time soft bandages had been wrapped carefully around her gashed wrists, his breathing had calmed and his teeth no longer bared ready for murder. She broke the silence first. 'Thank you.' she rasped, her throat was raw. He rose and crossed the room, reaching for a goblet of wine which he brought to her lips and helped her drink. 'I'm sorry,' she said lowly, when her throat was soothed, 'that you were put to the trouble of fetching me, after all.' Ok, *deep breath*. This chapter was hideously, horribly, awful to get written. So if you could squint over any errors in it, i'd be very grateful! Thank you for your kind comments last chapter, its so AMAZING to hear from those of you who are reading, I can't even tell you how happy comments make me. If you are expecting Pirithous and Theseus to get dealt with this chapter, I'm afraid you will be disappointed, that's for chapter 10. Hades had to realise something quite important first. I was as surprised as you. Oh, and I'm sorry for how erratic my posting is. If you don't know already, there is a little 'subscribe' button at the top of the page that will send you an email when I update- it also lets me keep track of how many of you are actually reading!:) He looked at her, seemingly dumbfounded for several long moments, and Persephone inwardly squirmed, feeling that her feeble attempt at a jest had gone sadly awry. She closed her eyes in an attempt to lessen her embarrassment. Hades sat down beside her on the great bed and drew a soft blanket over her. 'Sleep, little wife. Your injuries are severe.' His voice, that low pleasing caress to her senses, was close to the shell of her ear and she opened her eyes to see him lean over her and gently kiss her bloodied forehead. Curiosity, which was not a vice she usually struggled to contain, made her grasp at his hand and voice her questions. 'Husband, please. I'll not rest well until I know what those men wanted with me! I have met Pirithous once, Lord Hades, and I have no notion of why he sought to harm me.' Hades eyes grew darker and the tender expression in them was replaced by a steely thirst for blood to be spilled. His hand, still entwined with hers was to his lips and he rained kisses on her trembling fingers. Doubtless they would show bruising very soon. 'I will find out, my dear. I had them sent to Tartarus, I hope the Erinyes don't send them mad with anguish- I intend to question them once you are well again. A day or two there will loosen their tongues, they will beg to confess once the Furies get started.'' The sheer ferocity in his voice when he spoke of Pirithous and Theseus sent a shiver through the battered girl on the bed. Hades noticed it and drew off his cloak to cover his wife. 'Thank you,' she whispered, for the second time that day. 'Thank you for hearing me. Thank you for sending help. I don't...' tears leaked from her eyes, she barely registered them, 'I cannot even think of what might have happened had you not done so.' Her gratitude and fear must have been clearly shown on her face, for Hades hauled her to him and his arms fastened about her like a vice. He breathed into her hair. 'I will always come when you bid me near you, Persephone. I sent the furies because they are faster than I, both in the Underworld and above. I have fought in a war so terrible that it would make your precious blood run cold, and then I went into battle unafraid. When I felt you calling for me, the terror in your voice, my darling...I hope never to feel so powerless again.' Persephone was silent, she pitied him, in the same way she had pitied her mother when he had taken her. It was plain to her, in this moment, wrapped as he was around her that he did not value her as a mere possession- there was clearly more than that in his heart. Whatever strength of affection he had for her, hers could not match it...and she pitied him for that too. Persephone felt no shame in the peace that enveloped her, as she rested in his strong arms, though. In his bed, with this fearsome god protecting her- from even the cold, she did not feel so afraid. Her ordeal was over, for now. She would sleep and recover, and in the morning she would muster up the courage to deal out dire punishment to the fools who would attack a Queen. It was bloodthirsty thought, unusually for her, but she drifted off gently to sleep regardless- with a slight smile turning up her lips. ************ When she awoke, Hades was still beside her. She looked inquiringly up at him when he noticed that she was conscious and he looked rather pleased as he passed her a cup of cool, fresh water. 'I would have left you to slumber in peace, my Lady; but alas, you were utterly unwilling to permit it.' 'Oh!' his wife blushed, realising that at some point during her rest, she had wound herself around her husband tighter than ivy on a solid branch. She disentangled herself, feeling quite self conscious when his dark eyes did not leave her. Persephone did not think she was vain, but clambering off the bed and heading straight towards a mirror gave her a moment to compose herself. She supposed she ought to see the extent of the damage, after all. The most severe of her injuries had healed, there was no blood left on her face and the wounds had knit themselves into tight, brown scars. Her forehead looked the worst, she supposed, a mottled purple with green at the edges. Persephone grimaced. 'I think I shall wait until I am fully healed before I confront my attackers. They need to know they are dealing with a goddess after all.' She said it mildly, but allowed the slightest edge of firmness to creep into her words. Hades was looking amused, so she raised her chin for good measure. Her husband leaned back against his pillows, she could see the indentation where she had just lain and felt heat rise up her neck once more as she watched his elegant hands smooth the creases out of the cover idly. 'And what makes you think I will permit such a thing, my dear?' 'Hades! I must! I deserve to have my vengeance!' 'You shall have it, little wife- I shall dole it out for you. You need not subject yourself to such unpleasantness.' Persephone felt her temper rise. 'Husband! You cannot mean it! Please, I entreat you.' Something gleamed in his eyes that she could not name. 'How the innocent maiden has been corrupted!' he sighed, amusement still playing about his lips 'Sweet Persephone; who used to turn away from the tears of the condemned shades now bargaining for a part in my judgement.' Hades rose gracefully from his bed and stood, holding out his hand in invitation. She padded over to him and took it. 'I suspect,' he continued, slowly, 'that one of those men has looked on my wife with lust in his eyes and if he does it again in front of me...' 'What?' she prompted, curious once again. 'I am likely lose my temper and kill him too soon, my dear. Once he is dead, I can consign him to eternal suffering- but I want his death drawn out,' Hades voice softened to a dangerous hiss. 'I want him to beg for his life whilst teetering endlessly on that agonizing brink that lies between living and dying. They will regret their foolishness.' Persephone couldn't account for it, really she couldn't, but she reached up and pressed her lips to his. The response was instantaneous, Hades kissed her ruthlessly in return and had just brought his hands up to drag the sleeves of her dress from her shoulders when a knock sounded at the door. Blocking her from sight of the door with his body, Hades granted permission to enter. His eyes never left hers. 'Well?' he said coldly, to the male servant who hovered by the door. 'News has just reached us, great King. Lord Hephaestus requests entrance to your realm.' Persephone, standing so close to him, saw Hades' eyebrows raise in disdain. 'Bid him come, then.' he was all he said. 'He mentioned her majesty, sire.' The messenger spoke again, carefully. Hades, his face suddenly turned unreadable, turned around to face the man. 'In what manner?' he enquired. 'Lord Hephaestus wishes to present her with a gift, my King.' Hades paused and then with deliberate exaggeration, waved the man away.'Very well. Be gone.' Bowing low, the messenger fled. Persephone smiled slightly at the quick exit of Hades' servant, amused at her husband's lack of concern that he terrified nearly all he encountered. She understood, a little now, that to be so feared was to live a lonely life. It was an isolation she had encountered upon returning above the earth as his queen. He stooped and swiftly kissed her. 'You need not come, if you do not feel well enough- my dear.' he said. 'I can...dispense with the blacksmith.' She did not feel well, in truth, but neither would she lay abed whilst the King of the Underworld terrorized the gentle, lame Hephaestus; who had braved the realms of death in order to bring her a present. Besides, she was curious. She took his arm and lightly guided him to the door, he moved easily to her slight pressure. Hades attentively shortened his stride to match hers, as they made their way through the bright hallways of the palace towards the throne room. The consideration was one she was grateful for, she was still achingly sore. Hephaestus, the god of craftsmanship, stood before the dias and turned, bowing low as they entered. In his hand he held a rough, hessian sack and Persephone stiffened at the sight of it. Bravely lifting her chin, she mounted the shallow steps with Hades' assistance and sat, gratefully on her throne. 'Speak then, son of Hera. What brings you to our realm?' Hades was not precisely rude to Hephaestus, but there was something...sinister, in his manner of speech that caused Persephone's eyebrows to twitch together. 'I bring gifts, for your Lady queen- in honor of your illustrious marriage- majesty.' Raising his eyes at last to her face, Persephone saw the shocked disbelief flash across Hephaestus' face. The conclusion he drew was clear, his eyes immediately flicked to Hades and his next words were nigh on spat out. 'I have heard of the decree of the fates...this device will mark the passing of time, without need of the sun. It will give you, o queen, a reliable indication of when your time to leave here approaches.' He withdrew his hand from the sack, holding a dark orb with lights shining like the stars from within it. He approached the steps cautiously, his eyes taking in her poor abused face,expression furious and held out the device to her. She was about to reach forward and take it when Hades stood abruptly and intercepted it and passing the gift to his wife, who took it with a quizzical lift of her brow. Persephone touched the orb carefully, from within a mechanical clicking could be heard, a little like the chirp of crickets that she had so often heard as a girl. Smiling, she raised it to her ear to listen more carefully. Hades stood by, glaring at Hephaestus, who stood his ground. 'Tell me, coppersmith, how can this tell me such things as you claim?' she asked softly, intrigued. Hephaestus stood a little taller under her notice. Hades returned to his throne. 'It is a matter of being able to read it, my lady.' he said, grinning with enthusiasm for his art.. 'The largest of the lights represents the sun above and the red glow depicts the main light of this kingdom. As time progresses, they each move away from each other within the globe and when they cross- that is your time to depart or return.' Persephone beamed at him and reached out her hand for him to kiss. 'I thank you then, friend. Your skilled craftsmanship is famed for good reason. I daresay I shall keep it beside my bed, always.' Hephaestus limped forward to bestow a light, courteous kiss on the tips of the queen's fingers releasing them gently when he heard an ominous low rumble from her husband. Persephone's cheeks spread with warm colour as she thought guiltily of Hades' words to her before they were wed. That he would guard what was his, that he would indeed be a jealous husband. Had she flaunted him, just now- even unintentionally? Where was the cautious, ever respectful attitude that she had so carefully preserved in his presence? Had it melted away with a few passionate kisses? Perhaps the excitement of her return had addled her wits. She leant across the arm of her chair and laid a hand on Hades forearm. The muscles beneath her hand were taut and as hard as the glittering diamonds that were embedded in his throne. Hephaestus spoke. 'Perhaps I might beg a word in private, my lady?' Persephone opened her mouth to deny him but was forestalled by the haughty Hades. 'You might beg all you please, lame one but any words you for my wife must and shall be uttered before me. Hephaestus was not a coward. It was true that physically speaking, he was weaker and more repellent than the others of his race but he was a god, nonetheless. He would not, could not allow such blatant disdain pass unnoted, not even from the august king whose halls he now stood within. 'I believe I addressed my lady.' he drawled. His arm, strengthened by long hours hammering at his forge, flexed. Not quite a threat, not precisely a challenge. The slight movement was noted however, and Hades casually, insultingly, swung his sceptre to and fro. The subtle message was clear. 'Not so,' responded Hades quietly, 'you addressed my lady. Have a care with your words, lame one, should you be any more familiar with the Queen of the Underworld, you may find yourself robbed of them.' 'Is that a threat?' Hades laughed. The room rang with it, softly derisive and so very assured. 'I am not famed for idle threats, son of Hera. Speak then, and leave. You grow tiresome and my lady grows weary.' Persephone, who had remained silent and watchful in the face of their barely restrained aggression, soothingly stroked the arm that remained hard under her hand. 'Indeed, kind Lord Hephaestus, do speak- if you bear a message from my mother, there is no reason why my husband should not hear it.' Hades' arm relaxed, ever so slightly at her words and soft ministrations. Hephaestus looked confused. 'I bear no such greeting, o queen. I wished to offer...protection...in the face of your injuries. Should you be in need of refuge- I am at your command.' Hades leapt from his throne, his face full of thunder. 'Fool! You would steal my wife from me! You would dare...' Persephone stood also, reaching out for him. 'Husband, please! I am sure that no such suggestion was intended. Lord Hephaestus may have...I believe he may have reached the wrong conclusion regarding my injuries.' She stepped close to Hades, her instinct guiding her to offer reassurance to soothe and calm the towering rage she could see building in him. She turned to Hephaestus. 'Sir, I thank you for your kindness but...his majesty is not responsible for this.' With her free hand, she indicated her face. 'On my return to the Underworld, I was set upon by a pair of vicious mortals, my Lord Husband saved me, sir. It is his protection that I shall rely upon.' Hephaestus gaped at her, his rugged face alight with astonishment. 'I beg your majesty's' pardon, then,' he said graciously, at length. He paused, awkwardly shifting his weight from his lame leg, 'but...mortals you say? It is unheard of. I cannot understand it.' Hades wrapped his arms about Persephone and drew her close to him. 'You are not required to understand it, Hephaestus. It is I who must understand it, my wife shall be avenged. One of them at least is a demigod, he sought to abduct her, to make her his. Such a crime cannot go unpunished. I will see to it.' Here Hades lifted a hand to rhythmically stroke the hair of the woman in his arms, heedless of Hephaestus' fascinated gaze. Persephone, embarrassed by such open affection turned her face to Hades' shoulder. She was so tired. Hephaestus could not tear his eyes away from the royal pair in front of him, Hades looked back, knowingly. The great and powerful god of the kingdom of death knew well the envy that was in his heart. What male could meet with such a woman and not be affected by her? Hades knew, and would keep what was his. The blushing goddess had absolutely no idea how very appealing she was. He could not win this battle, but perhaps he could leave with some dignity if he could at least crack Hades' blasted superiority. Hephaestus inclined his head, readying himself for the retreat. 'I am quite sure that the Lady will be well protected from now on, then. I wonder, your Majesty, if your punishment to those who assaulted her will be more grievous because their crime against her, echoes your own, so very...closely.' Persephone stiffened against Hades and turned, wide eyed to look on Hephaestus. What could possibly have prompted him to make such an audacious remark? He looked unrepentant, triumphant even. She turned her head to Hades, expecting to see him preparing for a murder. Instead, he was staring blank faced at the blacksmith, a tumult of emotion stormed in his dark eyes. He did not move, not towards Hephaestus, nor away from her. He stood stock still, save for the suddenly rapid moving of his chest. The hand that had been stroking Persephone's dark curls clenched into a fist in her hair. Hades swallowed. 'Very well, lame one. Your point is well made.' he sounded thunderstruck. The King of the Underworld looked down at the gentle, sweet goddess by his side. A whole world of feeling was in his eyes but his voice was flat as he addressed the cunning craftsman one last time. 'Now get...out.' So. Yes. I actually quite like this chapter, not sure its up everyone's street- but aside from the first chapters, its been one of the easier ones to write. You know, bit of vicious judgement being doled out...why on earth wouldn't the words flow on to the page? Here is your warning. This may be unpleasant to some of you, there is blood and nastiness ahead. Skip it if you don't care for that sort of thing. I'm a little overwhelmed by how lovely you all are, I have been having such kind comments left for me to enjoy and it looks like this chapter will push us over a thousand hits. yikes! When I started this, I was aware that not many people flock to this fandom, but I was completely willing to write it anyway because I couldn't resist. I figured that if one person read it and enjoyed it then it would be utterly worth it. Thank you for your support. Persephone stood, in the circle of her husbands' arms long after Hephaestus had left. She remained silent, unsure what to say that might ease the awkwardness that had settled over them. Hades had stooped to bury his face in her hair and she felt him trembling. He said nothing, making no sound, but neither did he release her. Persephone, kind hearted as she was, wished that the blacksmith god had retreated sooner. It was true that Hades had abducted her just as it was unavoidably certain that Pirithous and Theseus had sought to do the same. Nevertheless, what good did it do to raise such a subject? She had eaten the food of the dead, she was irrevocably under the rule of King Hades- even as she ruled over his subjects. She could admit to herself that she did not like to see this proud, mighty man so distressed. Eventually, when her head spun and only his arms kept her standing; Hades raised his head. He avoided her gaze, but not even his carefully blank expression could hide the glaze of tears that he did not allow to fall. He took a step back, bowing to her and she closed her eyes against a wave of nausea that rose up in her throat. 'Come. You should rest. If you insist upon your revenge against Pirithous and the half-wit King of Athens, you will need to at least be able to stand under your own power. Rest until the center of the earth is cloaked with red, then we shall go to Tartarus.' He half carried her back to her room, Persephone made no objection. The gift from Hephaestus was placed gently on a polished table. Her husband drew the cover up over her shoulders and bent to whisper a kiss to her mouth. She was asleep in moments, but found her mind plagued by strange dreams in which Hades and Demeter circled the globe around her, never crossing and always so very far apart. She heard the voices of strange men in her nightmares and fancied that she heard their howls of agony all the way from Tartarus. *********** She was woken, when rosy light bounced obnoxiously through her window, by the usual procession of maids to assist her in dressing. She was glad of the ornate robes and jewels they so carefully arrayed her in. Such finery provided her with a feminine sort of armour against her nerves. They powdered her face, tinted her lips and dressed her dark curls with oil before pinning on her diadem. When Persephone looked at herself in the mirror she drew herself up with pride at the sight that met her eyes. With her chin up and dressed in her splendour, she looked every bit as powerful as Hades' consort ought to look. It was only when she stepped closer to her reflection, after waving the silent women away, that she saw that old timidity lurking within.. She would conquer her fear of displeasing, if only for today. Today was a chance to set her name firmly into the legends and tales of the mortals. Whatever she had told Orpheus, she had no desire to be forever painted by men as a helpless victim of circumstance. Something inside her, something unequivocally her, told her that she was worthy of something more than that, she simply had to take it. The king met her at the door of her chambers, surprising her again by bowing in response to her slight obeisance. His eyes warmed as they rested on her black gown. 'That is....a very striking effect, my Queen. It was well thought of.' Hades himself looked no less intimidating. He wore his shining armour of gold and atop his head perched his famed helm of invisibility, crafted by Hephaestus himself in the fires of Mount Etna. He saw her looking at it curiously and remarked gravely, 'It seems that for all his shortcomings, the lame craftsman provides much that is useful.' He offered his arm and they went out together to his chariot. Persephone still disliked the stamping, furious beasts and neither was she pleased by their extreme pace or lurching gait. She could accept though, this time, that having Hades' arms either side of her was certainly reassuring. He would never let her fall. They rode, quickly, to the furthest edges of the Underworld, far away from her favoured willow grove and beyond sight of the Elysian Fields where the shades all grovelled on the ground as their chariot sped past. The landscape, never especially verdant in the Underworld, became desolate and bleak. Nothing grew, nothing stirred. The ground began to slope downwards and as they descended, the air became sparse and tasted of rotting flesh. The light grew dimmer and dimmer, until the blackness closed in around the chariot and its occupants. Hades did not seem perturbed, neither did he seem confounded by the lack of light. He guided his horses unerringly through the inky nothingness until the faintest glimmering glow appeared in the distance and a dark walled city could just be made out ahead. She heard the screams, even before they came within sight of the gates of Tartarus. The horses, held securely by her husband, laid back their ears and whinnied in response to the blood curdling howls of the condemned. Persephone stiffened. Part of her, the part that came from the sheltered home with her mother, did not wish to enter this place. The place for the condemned, which even the gods did not mention casually. She would not quail. She would not plead and beg with her husband to spare her this grim task for which she had entreated him. He would remain with her, she knew this much and took comfort from it. The great gates that securely guarded all manner of horrors opened wide at a gesture from their master. Cerberus, the dark, three headed hound of hell, gnashed its teeth and breathed foul breath upon them as they passed between its massive paws. Persephone's crown weighed heavily on her head but she did not allow her head to sink beneath its pressing authority. When Hades held the horses still, he assisted her down and squeezed her hand in reassurance. 'It is not far, the Erinyes would not have taken them to the depths, they will be nearby.' He looked grim, this was not a place which anyone would willingly come to, yet Hades sojourned to Tartarus whensoever his duty demanded it of him. She could admire that bravery. One of the furies flew overhead of them as they moved away from the chariot. The darkness here seemed to be something tangible, it was as though an immense city was fashioned from thick, black shadows, shadows that could only be made out by the harsh, uncompromising light that seemed to stem from nowhere at all. Hades scowled at the winged creature. 'Tisiphone, greet your Queen.' He spoke with more volume and assertiveness than was his wont and Persephone had a blinding flash of insight as to why. The further from the sky that Hades went, the more his power and authority was tested. In her father Zeus' palace he had barely raised his voice above a murmur...but she had instinctively appreciated his might hadn't she? Here, in Tartarus he was surrounded by those who challenged him, souls and creatures whom he held here against their wills. This was why Hades ruled this place. Was he, in fact, the only one of the three brothers who was able? Persephone looked at her husband, with this new insight and for a moment understood him better than she ever had. There was much food for thought, once this duty was done, she would retreat to her willow grove and ponder all that she had learnt of him. Tisiphone hurtled towards the ground (earth, it could not be called- not even Demeter could draw life from the miry tar of despair that served as a floor here) and prostrated herself before Queen Persephone. The Queen saw that the large, leathery wings were scaled with the still blooded fingernails of the fury's victims, and quickly bade her lead on to the prisoners. Tisiphone shrieked a cry of death and sped off. The royal pair made their way to the cell in which the prisoners were kept, bound in wicked chains. The light, Persephone noted, was not like the light from the great sun in Zeus' sky, nor like the fiery ball that served the Underworld. It was a light that was beyond description in colour and intensity- she herself found it uncomfortable, Hades merely squinted his eyes against it- yet the captives before them seemed to be struck with the wildest agonies by it. Theseus cried out, true desperation caused his voice to crack and waver.There was little resemblance now between the prowling King of Athens who had thrown a sack over her head and the broken, bleeding man on his knees. 'O Queen! Have mercy! Please. I beg of you. Mercy for foolish Theseus.' He crawled towards her and reached out a hand to touch the sole of her foot. Hades stepped forward and swung down his heavy broadsword, cutting off the tips of the man's fingers. 'You have not learned your lesson then?' he hissed,'That she is not to be touched? You are not worthy to look on her. If you do so again, I will command the furies to gouge out your eyeballs and roll them into the Styx.' Theseus whimpered. 'Your pardon, great King.' He tried to turn his face away from the light and the goddess he had wronged. 'What can I do? What must I promise? If anything can be done, I will do it. Have pity on me!' He whined and writhed on the floor as Alecto clawed, playfully, at his gushing fingers. Persephone leaned into her husband, grateful for his strength. 'Why does the light hurt them so?' She asked. She found that there was a kind of strange pleasure to be had, in hearing the wretched man beg so humbly. Hades, one hand still holding his sword, did not take his dispassionate gaze from the pair of men that grovelled before him. 'The light is truth. There is nothing so painful as being made to see everything, even oneself by its glow. Even we gods are not immune to its power. The condemned must face eternity unable to lie to themselves that they do not deserve their punishments.' The truth. Perhaps that explained why she was so desperately clinging to Hades, whom she had professed to hate not so long ago. 'I see.' Was all she said. It certainly explained a good deal about her husband. He was, unflinchingly,cruelly, honest, she supposed. He did not tell her pretty lies in order to placate her, he stated fact and reason and did so unapologetically. A god who so often had business in Tartarus would need such brutal veracity. It was even more of an explanation as to why he did not rule the sky nor the oceans- but instead took charge of this place of terror that both gods and mortals feared so. Persephone, feeling her own power acutely, gestured to the waiting Fury to raise Pirithous up from the floor. She looked at his blood covered face, unsympathetic and utterly unafraid. He could not meet her eyes. Vindication was not a comfortable feeling, nor was it a relief. 'You laid hands on me, Pirithous. I want to know why. You spoke of a worthy wife. Speak now of your unworthy ambitions.' Her tone was softly laced with derision and the quivering wreck before her flinched at her question. 'It was all a wager. Just a stupid, foolish bet. We were drunk, we spoke of finding wives who would show our fellow men that we were far better than they. Theseus...together we took Helen of Sparta, she is young and fated to be the loveliest of all mortal women. I wanted a daughter of Zeus...so I chose you. I was struck by your sweetness at your presentation...how very...innocent you were, I wanted to....' The Queen held up her palm to halt his speech and he choked on the words he tried to force out. Hades pounced. He shot forward and grasping the Pirithous' blood slicked hair in his hand, forced his neck back to breaking point. The man could not even gurgle his own blood, such was his agony. 'I could break your scrawny neck with one hand, o worthless Pirithous. I could end your life right now and spend eternity taking my revenge on you for your hubris. No god would speak for you, not one. Not even your exalted father.' Hades drew back and spat in Pirithous' face. 'I shan't yet, though.' Hades smiled, a savage terrible smile. 'Your manner of death shall be decided by her. The Queen of the Underworld will choose in what manner your rotten thread of life will be snipped... and then,' he paused with evident satisfaction, 'you will face my judgement. You like bets, lapith? I will stake a wager with my wife that you will curse the mother that bore you by the time you cross the Styx, rather than face my wrath. What say you, my Queen?' Persephone lowered her lashes. 'I will take your wager, my Lord. I think he will rue that he was born long before then.' Something dark and amorous sparkled in Hades gaze as he smiled on his wife. 'Speak your judgement on these men then, Lady wife.' Hades smiled. Persephone raised her hands, she had thought much of this. 'They must be taken to great Poseidon's shore. Their bodies will harden and grow as dark as their hearts. They will become granite, able to feel and to think but unable to draw that next breath or to cry out their pain. The wind and the rain will bite into their bodies. Year by year the elements will eat at them until they perish into dust. A slow death, my Lord Hades...and an even slower afterlife.' Hades threw Pirithous to the floor. 'So be it. It shall be done.' Hades stood over the pair and watched as the curse crept from their feet, up twitching legs and into their torsos. It took but a moment before their faces were hardened into dark rock, their mouths still open as their last screams were frozen before they could end. The furies flapped around the room, leaping a merry, macabre dance, before their claws scraped and dug into the stone arms of the condemned kings and lifted them up, carrying them off. The weepings and wailings of the other inmates of Tartarus seemed quieter now to Persephone, once that sombre judgement was passed. Hades wiped the blade of his sword and sheathed it. 'I should like to go.' she said. 'Thank you for letting me come. I do not like it here, but...it was necessary.' He led her out of Tartarus, with its harsh revealing light, and handed her back up to the chariot. She felt his breath on her neck as he steered the horses in the darkness, toward home. It did not trouble her, this intimacy. Tartarus had forced her to see him as he was, but so too did it make her see herself; and more importantly, what she could be. She could be a Queen, a wife and a daughter and still be quintessentially herself. He would be a King and a husband, his role- his fearful destiny- did not define him, just as hers did not dictate her own character. Her character was whatever she chose to make of it. Persephone turned her lips to Hades throat and felt him swallow convulsively. She would unravel him, this mysterious husband of hers. She would discover every facet of his being and she would come to glory in being the only one in existence, who could. All mistakes are mine, this is completely un-beta'd, sorry! If I named these chapters, this one would be called 'The quality of mercy.' I do like a bit of Shakespeare! (See the end of the chapter for more notes.) He did not take her directly back to the palace, instead, he guided the horses through the blissful fields of paradise towards Persephone's willow grove. His hands rested lightly on her waist as he lifted her down from the chariot and remained there as he looked down at her. She sagged against him. 'How did you come to rule the Underworld, husband? Did you draw straws with your brothers, as the mortals say, and come here by chance? Tell me. I...Tartarus it...' Hades smiled slightly at her, his face close to hers. 'You need not explain, Persephone. I remember well the first time I went there. It took me the rest of the day to recover. Once the Titans had been suppressed and chained in the deepest part of Tartarus, the world was left in chaos- there were no boundaries, neither between the sky and the ocean nor between life and death. The Fates told us to go together to Tartarus, so that the light of truth could show us who was best suited to rule.' Hades drew breath, and gently stroked his hands up the sides of her waist, and brought them to rest behind her shoulders. A slight tug and Persephone stumbled against him, strong arms closed around her like a vice and Hades spoke softly into her hair, continuing his tale. 'There is no hiding from the truth, you know. Zeus and Poseidon could not stand to be there for long. I did not find quite it so dreadful as they. The truth is a comfort to me, it is one of the few absolutes we have as immortals- so much else changes. It is only this last visit, with you, that it caused me pain. Your endurance is commendable, by the way. I was... proud of you today. You are a true Queen, I saw that regality the very first time I laid eyes on you.' He took her hand and led her through the wood, to the very first tree she had made spring up from the barren earth. It seemed so very long ago, as though the child who had watered that delicate sapling with her bitter tears; had little to do with the cold woman who had issued a death sentence earlier. It did not discomfort her, although she was sure that her mother would be horrified by the changes in her daughter (and likely blame Hades' influence!). She laid a gentle, loving hand on the bark of the drooping tree and glanced up to its canopy. She stilled. One of the branches gleamed silvery and dead in the gloam of the wood. Hades saw her looking and dropped her little hand. 'Ah yes. That. I am afraid that was my doing, my dear. When I took you to Mount Olympus and saw you leave with your mother, leaving me, I came here, intent on destroying all of it. I fear that, like my brethren, I mislike having my will crossed and my wishes disregarded- even by the Fates. I only got as far as killing that one branch before thinking better of it. Forgive me. I know this place is your refuge.' Persephone reached up a smooth skinned arm and touched the bough, it was solid silver. 'Did you seek to punish me, husband? By turning my sanctuary into a forest of cold, unliving statues? It is an odd reprimand to chose, surely.' She spoke quietly, gently, knowing that anger was surely an unwise response. She knew already that Hades yielded more to her when soothed rather than when challenged. He seemed unlike himself at this moment, standing so close to her and overtaken with self-reproach. The cold, icy authority that he wielded, so naturally, seemed dormant. The goddess took his hand, quietly enjoying his look of surprise. 'Tell me, husband. What altered your course? Why cease in destroying this place, once you had begun?' Hades' finger ghosted against her cheek and pensively dipped into the small furrow that creased her brow. 'This tree is the very one against which I stole your will from you. Do you remember? I...I have few regrets, my dear, those who have such qualms do not do well in Tartarus, after all- but I sorely regret taking your will from you that day. The memory of it stayed my hand. It occurred to me that you had more reason to wish punishment on me than I you.' Oh. She had been carefully watching his face. The sincerity of remorse animated his features. Persephone glanced back up to the silver bough, it was certainly very pretty- it would remain so forever, unchanging and constant, unlike the trees that would wilt and perish. It was rather fitting. She could not lie to him, not after having faced the deceit she had been practicing on herself, not after Tartarus. 'I remember.' Her voice trembled. 'You said that you wanted something that I had not given you, all I could think was that you had taken everything...until I could not think at all.' He heaved a sigh. 'Forgive me. I am sorry.' She did not relish this power she had over him, not in the same way she had fairly bloomed with satisfaction in her power over Pirithous and Theseus. She pitied him. Persephone brought tender fingertips up to his solemn countenance. 'I think you mistake me, Hades. You awoke something in me that day that I cannot regret. You were right, in a way, I was cold to you- it was all I knew until I kissed you then. When you took me back to mother, my mind was still in this grove, against this tree trying to resist begging you to make me feel that alive again.' Surprise now replaced the remorse on his face and something else crept into his eyes, something Persephone knew to be hope. 'It was not until later, this very day- in fact, that I admitted this to myself. What you did, in tricking me- making me eat that pomegranate...that was wrong, but I do not regret that moment in this wood.' His eyes had closed against the caress of her fingers upon his cheek, but he opened them when she finished speaking. 'I will beg your pardon for that instead, then, my Queen. That piece of trickery was beneath me, it was inspired by desperation- but it affected you deeply. I am sorry for it. I am even sorrier that it caused you to hate me.' 'Then you have my pardon, my Lord.' 'It cannot be so easily given.' he grimaced. 'If forgiveness is mine to give, then I shall issue it as I chose.' said the Queen, firmly. 'You have asked for my absolution, sir- why so surprised that I should offer it?' A wordless expression of sheer frustration escaped King Hades' lips. 'It ought not be so easy as that, Persephone. You should command a great deed or impossible quest of me, you should ask for my most treasured possession...anything, your pardon is too precious to be simply given at the asking. I cannot believe my deceit to be forgiven, not without having earnt it. 'Can it be earned? Surely it is the more valuable for being undeserved.' She kissed him, quickly on his astonished lips. 'I forgive you, husband. What is done cannot be undone, your ill deeds against me have changed me but not necessarily for the worse. I am Persephone, I am Kore. There is no difference, not within.' Hades turned away from her, quite overcome. When he turned back to her, his hands were trembling. He dropped to his knees before her and for a moment she felt afraid for him. His distress was so very great. 'Command me.' My Lord?' His head was bowed and his hands reached out to the backs of her knees. 'Command me. I am your supplicant. I beg you to make some request of me.' In an instant, Persephone was transported back to her first time in Hades' throne room. On her knees before him she had made the gesture of supplication that had gone unheeded. Her heart beat loudly in her chest. 'Husband, please do get up. This isn't...its not necessary. I forgive you freely. There is nothing you could possibly do to make amends so let us regard the matter as closed. Please.' 'I know it isn't necessary. I believe you when you say that <i>think</i> you forgive me but...I want to do your bidding. Do you believe that such mercy as you have shown me can change a man? Can you understand what you have done?' He seemed to struggle to take a great gulping breath, and did not rise from his position of humility, but raised a hand to her arm. 'I have never shown mercy, Persephone. If I allow a soul to escape justice then it is always with a hefty price. I am undone...you have destroyed me.' Alarmed now, and utterly confused, Persephone crouched down beside him, burying her fingers in the ground, almost as habit. New green shoots sprung up, their odor fresh and sweet. 'Hades. My husband. I do not think I can understand. How should forgiveness be so very distressing to you? Help me comprehend this!' 'I have always despised pity, my beloved. I had none to spare, neither for myself nor for any other. I had none for you when I took you from the meadow. I wanted you, so I took you. I felt so affected by you at your presentation that I decided then and there that you would be mine. I gave no thought for your gentle heart, that it would grieve more for Demeter's anxiety than for your own imprisonment.' he spat out the last word. Loathing resounded from his every word. 'I stand for iron justice, my queen. My very nature is unbending. When I pass judgement on the souls of mortals, no pity- no compassion, is present. I have wronged you, Persephone- it is all the more abhorrent because you were undeserving of it, nothing but sweetness and grace ever crossed your path before me. I do not see that it is possible for you to forgive me that.' She listened in silence at his great outpouring and when he was done, wound her arms around his neck as they knelt in the dirt together. The shades of the Underworld did not venture to her wood, which was fortunate, she thought, since there was little majestic or powerful about its King and Queen crouching, like children by a tree. She was glad of it, that this moment of raw honesty was all hers. She shrouded the wood in shadow and guarded the intimacy with jealousy. 'Oh Hades.' she whispered. 'Am I still Kore to you then? A mere girl, unable to discern when she has been wronged and so thus unable to forgive you? I am more than that, my lord. You have caused me to be more than that. It isn't...you need not tell me that you behaved wrongly. I know it. I bore the consequences of it, I even despised you for it- briefly.' she added when he flinched. 'Shall we journey back to Tartarus, husband? So that I can tell you in the light of truth, with not a trace of falsehood, that you are pardoned?' The slightest trace of humour found its way into her inflection as she concluded, 'I should prefer not to, you know, it isn't the pleasantest spot I have ever visited...but I shall if you continue to do me the discredit of thinking that I lie. My forgiveness is a gift to you, dear husband. If you wish to do me some service...then you may show mercy to the next mortal soul that asks for it, but my mercy is free.' The scent of the new mint, so fresh and clean, wafted about them. Her King did not respond in words, he only embraced her in return as they sat in the silence together. The pair remained entwined, together, for a long while and Persephone's limbs had long since gone stiff with disuse when Hades at last broke the companionable silence. 'I thank you, then.' Well now, it looks like we are winding down. It is possible that the next chapter will be the last. It depends on whether or not I get everything necessary into it. Thank you, once again to those of you who leave comments, your words cheer me up so much! I have posted 11 chapters of this now, and I think the panic that no one will like it has only gotten worse! I am not going to apologise for how 'easily' Persephone forgives Hades, he may have deserved to suffer, but forgiveness like that can and has changed people for the better. If we all got what we deserved, with no forgiveness or mercy...we'd be in a very sorry state, I think. *Monster Author Note Alert!* This last chapter is four and half thousand words, its a long one! Thank you, thank you and thank you to all you wonderful readers who have left me encouragement. It means so much, you almost bring me to tears with your kindness. I would like to dedicate this chapter to the beautiful MarquesadeSantos who has been so encouraging.:) Also. If I may indulge in a little self advertisment? http://archiveofourown.org/works/678890/chapters/1244053 This will take you to my ORIGINAL STORY which I am now posting. If you liked my writing and want to read a bit more, please go over there and enjoy. It's had even less footfall than I expected Blossoming to have (though you all surprised me!) and I would love to hear your thoughts on my special 'baby.' Ok. Read on!:) Persephone was true to the promise she had made to herself, in the course of the six months she spent with Hades, she exerted herself to understand him better. In private, he was more open than she had seen him elsewhere, and his devotion to her comfort and happiness was extremely gratifying. He seemed to gradually accept that she bore him no ill will, and every so often a lightness was plain to see in his eyes when they rested upon her face. She ruled by his side each passing day and there was much to be done, for Demeter's winter above the earth, was a harsh one, many mortals had perished. Persephone knew full well that Demeter, although in awe of him, had despised Hades in the past, on account of his apparent disregard for the lives of the weaker beings that populated the world. It was not lost on her that her mother, who had so carefully raised her to cherish every living thing, was bent on a path of destruction. Hades deserved his fearsome reputation, it was evident- but so too did Demeter earn the one that she was surely making for herself. The Queen herself, heard whispers of the stories being told about her, Orpheus had kept his word to her at least and wave upon wave of wandering souls pitied her for a while - until she passed judgement on them, and they saw the steely adherence to duty in Hades' beautiful Queen. She asked her husband, after having dismissed yet another plea for mercy from a grief stricken widow, what had happened to the gifted bard and his unfortunate wife. Hades grimaced. 'He disregarded the rules, and looked back. Eurydice was returned to her destiny. They will meet again in death.' There was no flinching from the truth, not as Hades' consort. Persephone sighed. 'Tis a pity. He had enough devotion, but not enough faith and courage. His wife must face the double disappointment of returning here and having a husband who lacks the necessary resolution to keep her. Perhaps their reunion will be the sweeter for the separation.' Hades looked thoughtful, as he beckoned forth the next shade to be judged. 'As will ours, my Lady? Hephaestus' gift to you shows that your departure is soon, the mortals will feel the bounty of the earth again and it is this realm that will be in want of Springtime.' Persephone felt wistful. 'I shall return, my Lord. In terms of eternity, half a year is not so very long. I...I shall miss you above all, I think.' She added, hesitantly. He had taken much persuading of her forgiveness, he was unlikely to accept that he held him in some considerable affection and esteem. Hades grimaced again. 'You will take my very heart with you, Lady wife, when you return to the world above. Will you return it to me when you come back, I wonder? Every moment out of your company seems an agonizing eon to me. I dread your departure, even as much as the mortals fear death. If Hades is to love his wife, then the Underworld will offer no comfort whilst you are gone.' Persephone's breath rushed out of her and tears blossomed. 'I shall return. Springtime must be brought to the mortals, if my mother's cruel curse on the land were to go unbroken, what would become of us? Would this noble court crumble and break when there were no more mortals to come hither for judgement? I shall return to you my husband. Each day that I am with you, I feel more and more, how much I could love you and how much I will cherish you as the ages roll on. Perhaps our time apart will leave me as desolate as it will you, I cannot yet tell.' Hades stared at her and was did not reply until they heard the case of the soul before them. A pleasant judgement to be passed, the child had passed an innocent, unerring life and was destined for Elysium. His love shone from his dark eyes when he turned back to Persephone, as bright and as precious to her as any jewel to be found in the earth. Hades caught her hand to his lips. 'You will love me then, little wife? Even apart from me, shall you think of me often?' his voice quivered, but he held himself in check. 'Only think of me with a little fondness and smile at me like that every so often and if my kingdom does fade and my power desert me, I shall have lived a fulfilled and joyous existence.' Persephone startled, wove her fingers into his hair, uncaring of the shades that drifted in the throne room. 'Do you think it possible, Hades? That we can simply cease to be?' He immediately leaned into her touch, with a small sound of contentment. 'Fret not, my dear. We shall have long grown weary of this order before it ends, as everything must.' It was too strange a thought for his wife, who wrapped her arms around him, seeking comfort before the pair rose as one and wended their way to the shores of the river Styx. Time passed and all too soon the time for her to return above the earth arrived. Hephaestus' orb seemed to glow brighter as the lights within met. Persephone looked anxiously to her husband's saddened countenance. It was not necessarily that his expressions had become more easily read, but rather with each moment of closeness she understood him better. Her heart ached for him, for his loneliness even as she wished to see her mother once more. He took her to the entrance to the Underworld himself, saying nothing, merely holding her hand with such quiet solemnity that she could not but weep. He kissed her tears away and uttered a husky farewell. 'Think of me, Persephone, when you light up the world above. Think of me, cast into darkness without you.' She nodded, unable to speak. A lump caught in her throat that she could not swallow down. She walked out into the, too bright, sunlight and could not bring herself to look back for fear that she would break her poor mother's heart by begging to remain with him. She did not consider the state of her own, for if she did she might go mad with confusion. Demeter met her, some way away from the slopes, beneath which she had said goodbye to the dark Hades. Her mother wept openly on her daughter's shoulder, Persephone looked about her in damp eyed dismay at the frosty, desolate earth. The lush greenery was gone, the world above looked exactly as she had supposed the Underworld might look, when she had been a child and prone to such imaginings. She pressed her mouth into a thin line of disapproval, it was an expression that had recently had the court of the Underworld quailing in fear- though it brought a gleam of amusement to somber Hades' dark eyes. She shook of that train of thought, a curious tightness in her chest at the thought of her husband. 'I am with you once more, my mother. Now let there be bounty and beauty on the earth again. Let there be no more suffering for the innocent mortals. Come, show me your lovely crops and flowers.' Demeter felt her daughter's reproach, gently worded though it was and frowned. 'You look entirely grown up, my girl. If only you had remained the adorable child you were before you were wrested from me!' She sighed, pitifully. 'Very well, I shall bless the world once more. There will be a glorious harvest, bountiful enough that if the people are careful it will last them throughout the expression of my sorrow. They must carefully store up their grain, as I shall carefully keep my moments of happiness with you. Take off that crown, my love- I will weave flowers into your hair.' Persephone shook her head. 'I will keep the crown, my dear mother, but would be glad to see bright blooms in your locks- you do not look half so much like Demeter without them.' 'Oh very well then.' grumbled Demeter, good naturedly and set about bringing life to the dead ground beneath them. Helios shone warmly down upon them in approval. Very soon the dryads and the nymphs came out from their secret places, rejoicing in the return of the younger goddess. Very soon there was laughter and dancing about her as she was greeted by her erstwhile companions. Persephone stood in the midst of them, quietly dignified as they frolicked and commented on her sober manner and lovely clothes. She was not unhappy precisely, but the months ahead of her seemed looming and long and the ache in her heart became stronger and sharper at the thought of such a long separation from him. It did not escape Demeter that her daughter was thus subdued. At first she attributed it to left over unhappiness from being away from the meadow for so long, but when her melancholy seemed to grow stronger as the time passed she knew that it could not be the sole reason. Her daughter's appetite was affected and although she daintily picked over the food that was offered, very little was actually eaten. It pained Demeter to see her child unhappy and she redoubled her efforts in entertaining and feeding her. In truth, the only thing that really seemed to please her majesty was the sight of nature growing and blooming about them. Seeing Demeter fulfilling her duty brought pleasure to Persephone's eyes, even as she thought wistfully of her own duty as Hades' consort that was being neglected as she did nothing with her mother. Her brow furrowed when it occurred to her that Hades, when he took her to Olympus, had been right- absolutely right. It was not natural for her to be torn between her life as a maiden and that of a wife. She was surely the only one, goddess or mortal, who was so divided. One day in late summer, the King of the Underworld visited the meadow as she sat with Demeter among the dancing poppies. The pair of them had been weaving lilies into braids for amusement. The days work was done, the trees bowed under the weight of heavy fruit, the barley and wheat grains were swelled with ripeness and mortals scurried about trying to gather it all in. They heard the rumbling of his horses hooves beneath the ground and this time Persephone knew what was afoot, especially in conjunction with her mother's spluttering outrage- uttering her husbands name like it was a curse when his chariot rent the ground in two. A darkly amused gleam appeared in Persephone's eyes as she considered that his name was not so much of a curse as hers was and did he absolutely have to rile up his sister even further by leaving a great gaping hole in the ground? The grass still would not grow over the spot where he had last come above ground, from. Demeter did not speak of it, but Persephone had seen her standing there- scowling in concentration with her bare feet sunk deep into the ground, but still no grass would grow. He left his horses some distance away and stood a little way off just looking at her. Demeter stormed over to him, ire flashing in her eyes- she looked magnificent and intimidating but Hades just stood still, watching. He did not even deign to glance at her until she addressed him. 'It is not yet time for your turn, Lord Hades. You are not welcome in my meadow.' Persephone's eyebrows rose slightly at Demeters blatant disrespect and she stood from her spot and padded gracefully over to them. 'I need no welcome from you in order to see my wife, Demeter.' His voice was quiet, soft and smooth, but so sinister that Demeter gulped. 'It isn't your turn!' She sounded so petulant that Persephone stifled a laugh, it was a tone of voice that she had heard all too often from disgruntled mortals, who had been judged according to their actions and misliked the results. Their displeasure never made any difference to Hades. 'Mother.' She said softly, 'I hardly mind. The Fates put no such sanctions on us that I cannot speak to either of you whilst the other has me.' Demeter whipped around to face her daughter, rage and disappointment turning her lovely features twisted and ugly. She opened her mouth to vent her anger at her daughter and then closed it again hurriedly when powerful Hades raised his hand to still her tirade before it even began. Demeter's shoulders sagged. 'I will finish the lilies then.' She muttered, and stalked off. Persephone reached for Hades' hand, smiling. 'What brings you, husband?' She asked. 'I thought perhaps, you might like to know of a promise fulfilled.' He said quietly, his eyes were soft as he looked into hers. He leant forward and breathed in the fresh scent of spring that engulfed her. 'You asked me to grant mercy to the next one that asked it of me. Heracles, son of Zeus, journeyed down to our palace and pleaded for the life of Theseus, King of Athens. I granted it. Pirithous, of course, remains.' Persephone digested this, blinking. Hades did not rush her, simply playing idly with a smooth curl by twisting it around his finger. 'I thank you then, I suppose. It cannot have been an easy promise to keep. It is unfortunate that the first request for mercy came for one who has injured us. Nevertheless, it was well done of you. Heracles will remember it. Thank you for coming so far to tell me... I am glad to see you.' And she was. The aching, empty feeling that had pervaded her heart since she had left him, had gone. In its place was something akin to the joy she felt when a new flower blossomed and spread open its petals to the sunlight. It was not love, not in the romantic sense that Aphrodite advocated and Zeus abused- but perhaps she did care for him, as a wife ought to care for her husband. It was time to take responsibility for the course of her own life. 'Hades.' She said, and he looked up from his engrossment with the twist of dark hair around his fourth finger. 'What...' she felt so nervous and awkward, 'would you be...' she stopped and tried again, 'When the summer ends, I should like to end this ridiculous business of my life being split in two.' She expelled out a breath once she had said it, pleased to have it out in the open. The large hand that played with her hair stilled. The ground about Hades feet turned black and withered. Death spread outward in a circle about them, ever widening until the blooms in Demeters hands shrivelled up, causing her to drop them in alarm. Persephone held her breath, not comprehending the bleakness in Hades, now lifted, gaze. 'Hades! Please cease! I thought you'd be pleased.' He seemed unreachable for a moment, so dreadful and stern that Persephone's courage was sorely tested to even speak to him. At her honest words and earnest look, he flicked his finger and the destruction stopped, leaving the King and Queen standing in the centre of a perfect circle of withered nature. Demeter stood on the edge of the circle, either unwilling or unable to step foot into it. Hades took his wife's face in both palms and made her look at him square in the eye. He looked both afraid and ready to do battle. She twisted in his grasp, freeing herself and pulled his lips down to hers. He gasped out, in between kisses, 'I suppose you did not mean that as I interpreted it.' He held her gently, slightly away from him so that he could watch her expression and asked, 'Do you mean to say, that when you come home to me, that it will be forever?' At her nod, he smiled, palpably relieved, and Persephone marvelled at it. 'I adore you, Persephone.' 'Yes,' she replied, seriously, 'I know it. I...am not happy when you are not by, Hades. These few months ought to have been joyous for me, but instead my chest has ached at the very thought of you, as if it is empty and is longing to be filled again. I want to be a good wife to you, to make you happy, to be a good Queen- I think I can be, I will certainly try.' She blushed when he brushed her mouth gently with a finger, hushing her. She knew she was in danger of babbling. 'But you do not know if you love me? My little love, if you feel all this for me, I shall count myself blessed. If one day you can bring yourself to name it in the same way as others would, then I am doubly fortunate. There is no hurry, Persephone. If you are to choose to live with me, the kingdom will celebrate rapturously for days, for weeks, on end.' She did not notice the tears tracing her way down her cheeks until her husband brushed them away with the back of his hand. 'You will not mind if I come to see my mother often?' He let out a breath. 'Mind? How should I mind, knowing that you have chosen me? You are free to come and go as you please, my love- I don't imagine Demeter will look favourably on this new arrangement- but perhaps if you visit frequently, she will understand that I'll not keep you apart, not now.' He stooped a little to kiss her brow, 'You may have anything and everything you desire, my Queen, I swear it.' 'You will spoil me then, I will become unbearable.' She ventured a tease, pleased when she saw an answering glint in his eye. 'Oh no, I do not think it possible, Lady wife. To remain unspoilt is in your nature, it is part of your charm and character. Even if I were shower you with jewels and all the riches of the earth, I know, full well, that you will remain as you are.' He drew a finger to her nape and traced a path around her throat, he made a low pleased hum in his throat when her breath quickened and she leant forward to kiss him once more. 'A moment', he murmured softly in her ear, 'your mother is rapidly working herself into a rage, I must be gone soon. I can wait with more patience now, knowing that you wish to be with me.' When he lifted his finger from the skin of her neck, Persephone felt a cold weight resting there. A collar of diamonds and gold wound their way in a perfect circle about her slender throat. Satisfaction practically oozed from him and his wife could not help but chuckle when his hands went to her waist and he crushed his mouth to hers. They bade a fond, passionate, farewell and Persephone felt a good deal lighter of heart than she had at their last parting. She made her way back to Demeter, who knelt in the dirt, steadily coaxing life up from the dead ground. Persephone stooped to aid her, silently causing a clump of purple heather to spring forth. 'I hope he will not visit here often, my daughter.' Said the goddess of the crops, dryly. 'The affect on my meadow is quite devastating. Looking about her, Persephone nodded her head in agreement. At least this time plants could grow again in the cursed soil. 'He will have no cause to, mother.' She said quietly, watching Demeter's face change as she comprehended her meaning. Demeter took her hands out from the soil and knelt up. 'You have chosen him, then? Over me?' Her mother's eyes were glassy with tears, but they did not fall. 'Only so far as that I chose to be a wife to him over this half life that I am living. I will always be your daughter, always love you and bless you for having given me life. I will visit you often, even in the winter time. I can come when I please. Hades...he is very generous, Mother.' Demeter flicked her earthy fingers to the priceless diamonds about the young woman's neck and raised a brow. 'So I see.' 'I don't mean like that, dear one. I mean, he promises that I shall do as I please- he wants my happiness above all things.' 'He didn't care for that when he tore you away from me! He didn't even think of it.' Exclaimed Demeter. Persephone dug her hands into the ground again and watched as mint sprung up vigorously at her urging. 'Do you not believe that people can change, mother? That experience and regret can alter a man?' 'Not him, not us! We do not change. We are immortal, some things ought to stay unaltered.' It was grief that brought the frown to Demeter's face, it was plain to see. Persephone saw the lie for what it was, living with Hades had given her a distaste for dishonesty, even if it was unconscious. 'But you have, haven't you, Mother?' Her voice was hard and disapproving. 'You, who were so dedicated to your duty, but now will allow the innocent to starve to death on account of caprice. It was not they that changed things, the mortals have no say in such things, why make them suffer? Why send them to judgement in Hades' Realm?' Demeter gaped at her and flinched when Persephone regally lifted her chin. Even without her crown and throne, her daughter was a Queen, Demeter saw it and averted her gaze in submission. The Queen of the Underworld continued on as though the dynamic between mother and daughter had not just subtly, permanently, shifted. 'Whatever you may believe, we are all capable of change whether it be for the better or for worse. Hades has remained as he is for eons, why should he not alter- even in the slightest sense, in order to please me?' 'When will you go?' Demeter wept. 'When Hephaestus' orb shows that it is my time to return to the Underworld. We have the rest of the summer. I will visit often, throughout the winter...perhaps you will allow the mortals some respite, knowing that it will not be so very long before I next see you.' Demeter nodded. 'Yes...perhaps.' At one time, Persephone would have launched herself into her mother's arms at this concession, but now she remained slightly apart, a distance had grown between them- both women were aware of it, but it did not feel unnatural. Demeter busied herself with the soil again. Rosemary grew at her behest, sweet and fragrant. 'Hephaestus wanted to court you, you know. He asked me immediately after your presentation. It would have been a good match, he doesn't have Hades' rank, of course...but he is a kind man. I rejected him outright and not in pleasant terms. It strikes me now that things would have been so different if I had asked you, if I had allowed you to grow up.' 'I was not destined to be his wife, mother- you heard the Fates as well as I. Things are as they ought to be. Besides, from what I understand you were not the only one to depress his pretentions to my hand. Hades had already decided he would have me.' She waved her hands expressively toward the heavy jewels around her neck and the subject was closed. The two women turned their complete attention to repairing the extensive damage to the meadow. The rest of the summer was peaceful, Demeter clearly tried to come to terms with the realisation that her little girl was now a grown woman, and a powerful one at that. Persephone in turn did not begrudge her mother her wistful tears that came often. Together they revisited their happiest memories, Demeter told Persephone the tale of her birth and reluctantly answered her questions about her romance with Zeus. At the time the lights crossed in the, henceforth useless, orb, Demeter walked with her child and companions to the edge of the River Styx. They bedecked Persephone in the robes of a bride, with flowers woven into her hair. It was not a wedding, that moment had already passed, but Demeter wished to demonstrate to her daughter, more than anyone, that her love was as eternal as her heart. Hades stood on the far shore, watching the procession with curiosity. His Queen, with a fond kiss to her mother's dewy cheek, stepped onto the boat. It dipped slightly, riding lower in the water with her weight. Charon, his pole held loosely in skeletal hands, watched her from beneath a tattered cowl. Persephone tilted her head imperiously towards him. 'Well then, boatman. Carry me across. My Lord Husband awaits me. I am anxious to return home.' She saw the slight tremble of his fingers before he gripped the pole and pushed it into the murky water. She hid her smile by turning back towards the shore behind her and raising her fingers in farewell to her mother. She had no regrets behind her and an abundance of hope ahead of her. When she looked back to the shore ahead, she found that she could not look away. Hades stood tall and proud, the light from the Nether-sun behind him casting his face into shadow. She did not need to see his face clearly in order to know that there was a lurking smile in his eyes. All was quiet, save for the lapping of the water against the wooden craft and the occasional soft thud of Charon's pole hitting a rock on the river bed. Very soon, the whole realm would be filled with noise and celebration, Hades had decreed it. This time there would be no division of food, nor of heart. The boat came to a halt on the black sandy shore and King Hades stepped forward to take her hand, assisting to alight. She curtseyed, he bowed... and Persephone was home.",

      "Kore's eyes widened. 'Mother?'",
      "She had not heard such steely contempt Demeter's tone before.",
      "She tentatively spoke, 'It...it isn't his fault he's lame...he's a very good craftsman, he makes King Zeus' thunderbolts after all.'",
      "Demeter scowled. 'Are you telling me that you have entertained his suit, girl?",
      "Without my knowledge?' 'His suit?",
      "Oh no! I only spoke to him at the banquet...he was kind.'",
      "Demeter looked likely to rage at her until Hades lifted his palm. 'Enough.",
      "She is innocent.",
      "I shall speak to our ambitious smithy.'",
      "Kore gaped at him.",
      "His voice had changed from a pleasing, smooth rumble to something flinty and terrible.",
      "She saw quite clearly why the mortals feared him so much that they did not even speak his name.",
      "She herself, a lesser Goddess, was affected and trembling.",
      "Demeter put an arm about her shoulders and nodded at Hades. '",
      "Perhaps you are right, my Lord.",
      "I shall leave it to you.'",
      "He stepped onto his chariot and very nearly smiled when Kore shuddered. 'Farewell, sister.",
      "Blessings to you, my Lady.'",
      "Kore felt her mother's surprise and sank to low curtsey. 'I wish you a safe journey, sir.'",
      "She stepped forward to offerred him the flower, 'Thank you for bringing us home.'",
      "Demeter looked proud at her daughters thoughtful manners.",
      "Hades took the bloom and stared intently at Kore for so long that she feared that she had offended the Rich One with her simple gift.",
      "Eventually, he lifted it to his nose and inhaled. '",
      "So precious a gift for so trifling a service.",
      "It hardly seems a fair exchange.'",
      "She suspected him of mockery for a moment and frowned.",

      "Well, my dearest!",
      "We need not trouble our heads about the blacksmith.",
      "Hades likes to keep the distinction of rank, preserved.'",
      "Kore felt sleepy and yawned. '",
      "Yes, mother.",
      "Poor Hephastus.",
      "I think I shall rest for an hour.",
      "I am so glad I am not mortal, dear Mother.",
      "They could not feast all night as I have.",
      "They must waste so much time asleep.'",
      "The chestnut haired girl put her head on her arms and thought for a moment. '",
      "Was Lord Hades so intimidating against the Titans?'",
      "She enquired.",
      "Demeter turned grave at the memory. '",
      "He was much worse, little one.",
      "No god killed so many as he.",
      "He dealt merciless death even then.",
      "I have wondered often, if the fates intended for him to draw the shortest straw when the world was divided.",
      "I don't think either of my other brothers could rule the Underworld so well as he.'",
      "Demeter smiled. 'Did he frighten you very much, darling?' 'I think he must frighten everyone. '",
      "She kissed Demeter's warm, sun kissed cheek. 'I had a wonderful time.",
      "Thank you for taking me.'",
      "She fell onto a doze amongst the sweet, bright poppies and dreamt of joyful music, dancing nymphs and of the swirling faces of all the gods she had seen that night.",
      "(See the end of the chapter for notes.)",
      "Kore spent the next few weeks lingering close to her mother.",
      "Demeter kept her daughter nearby, taking Kore with her to the fields when she blessed the freshly sown seed.",
      "The corn and wheat would grow plump and strong this year, the grateful mortals would have a plentiful harvest.",
      "Eventually, Demeter allowed Kore to wander further afield with the nymphs and Kore relished the small freedom.",
      "They danced together in shallow streams, splashing and frolicking under Helios' bright rays.",
      "Sometimes, Kore would lead her friends into the shady forests, searching for a cool place to lie beneath the leafy canopy.",
      "She often felt watched during those times as she rested on the sweet smelling floor of fallen leaves.",
      "The feeling did not worry her, her mother was renowned for being protective of her child--if she sent someone to keep watch over her safety it was nothing unusual.",
      "On one bright, shining jewel of a day, Kore was wandering in the meadow near Demeter's grove.",
      "The nymphs were dozing on the banks of the stream at the bottom of the poppy field, Kore had wandered away from the group for a moment of solitude.",
      "Demeter had travelled to her white temple in the west to bless the mortals who worshipped there so diligently.",
      "Kore had been feeling on edge ever since her mother left.",
      "As she stooped to admire the vibrant red of a poppy, she felt the first tremblings of the earth as thunder rolled in from afar.",
      "Thinking it may be an approaching storm, Kore turned back towards the sleeping nymphs--intent on waking them and seeking shelter.",
      "She stopped still after a few steps in confusion.",
      "The rumbling was louder now and not in the distant, cloudless skies, but deep in the earth beneath her.",
      "No sooner had she realised this than she felt the ground quake beneath her feet.",
      "The bewildered goddess started to run, in her fear, not towards the sleeping maidens--but instead towards the shadowy forest.",
      "Her mother's meadow creaked and groaned, ever increasing in volume.",
      "A turbulent wind started to blow, billowing about her and whipping her long hair up into her face.",
      "Kore, truly alarmed and running in earnest now, turned her head in time to see the meadow split and heave before parting itself in a great cavernous entrance, to hell.",
      "A moment later and the thundering of heavy hooves rang out loudly from the depths within.",
      "She looked ahead to the forest and did not need to look back to see that they pursued her.",
      "The world seemed to blur before her eyes as she fled, faster than she had ever run before.",
      "Her heart pounded from within her chest and she had not even enough breath to scream her terror to the skies.",
      "She felt the beasts gain on her, almost so close that their breath stirred the hair that streamed out behind her.",
      "Kore heard the peculiar beat of the horses hooves as they drew alongside her.",
      "For a breathless, sobbing moment, Kore thought that they might pass her by, that her instinct had been at fault and that she had not needed to flee.",
      "In that moment she faltered and turned her head to look.",
      "Her fearful eyes just had time to see the grim faced god of the dead reach over the side of his chariot and with one hand still holding the reins, grasp her firmly by the waist and haul her to his chest.",
      "Kore knew, instinctively that if he took her back with him, underneath the earth, there would be no hope for her.",
      "She opened her mouth and screamed.",
      "Wordless, panic filled cries.",
      "She beat her hands against Hades' black armoured torso, kicked at his shins and tried to fling herself out of his grasp.",
      "His arm was unyeilding about her, it did not even loosen when she scratched and bit at it.",
      "The chariot made a sweeping arc in the meadow and, without breaking its pace-- sped downwards into the passage that had been ripped into the earth.",
      "Kore's screams fell silent when the ground closed over above them.",
      "She saw only the faint glimmer of ghostly light ahead of them in the suffocating darkness.",
      "For the first time in her happy, sheltered life-- Kore fainted.",
      "*",
      "*** When she came to, it was with the sensation of being lifted from the chariot by strong arms.",
      "There was enough pale light to make out Hades unmoving countenance.",
      "She closed her eyes again, not wishing to look on the face of the fearsome man who would deliberately tear her from her mother's protection.",
      "The King bore her in his arms for a little way until she heard the gentle lapping of water on a shore.",
      "She opened her eyes as they boarded a boat.",
      "Hades stood unmoving at the prow, looking onward across the river as a hooded, skeletal figure steered the vessel through the inky black waters.",
      "He did not speak, but Kore knew that he was watching her.",
      "As they reached the far shore, so hopelessly far from her home, the pale light changed from something watery and cold to a strong warmth that she thought at first might be the sun.",
      "She raised her head in bewilderment and looked about her.",
      "Tall grasses wafted in a gentle breeze, unrecognizable flora bloomed and tall trees stretched their branches wide beneath a misty sky.",
      "Kore did not think that it could possibly be the sky, but the swirling whiteness was high enough up that it made no difference.",
      "Hades did not set her down to get off the boat, he stepped down into the water and waded through the shallow waves to the shore.",
      "A different chariot stood waiting, held by a servant in a grey cloak.",
      "He bowed to his master and handed over the reigns but did not speak.",
      "The dread Lord set the terrified Kore down on the floor of the chariot and flicked the reigns.",
      "Kore hid her face in her hands and wept until they stopped again.",
      "He did not lift her this time, merely taking her hand and tugging her to her feet.",
      "She did not know how her legs supported her, but was glad they did since the only other option was utterly abhorrent.",
      "Hades led her through great iron wrought gates, through courtyard gardens and into an immense palace.",
      "Once inside, they made their way past silent servants and into a throne room.",
      "Hades throne stood on a dias against a wall of beaten gold and was itself encrusted with diamonds.",
      "He released her trembling fingers and went to sit on it.",
      "He made an imposing figure, sitting on his shining chair--a massive figure in black thrown into sharp relief by the brilliance of the gold behind him.",
      "Beaten into the metal wall were images of the crowned Hades waging war against the Titans, a suitable reminder of the power of the god before whom little Kore now stood.",
      "He did not speak, just watched her, his elbows resting on diamond arms and long fingers steepled under his chin.",
      "Abducting an innocent maiden did not seem to trouble him, his expression was no different to the first time she had seen him at her presentation in Zeus' palace.",
      "Kore thought of her mother.",
      "She would do anything to return to her arms again.",
      "Approaching the dias, she mounted the steps and lowered herself down.",
      "She reached up her hands to grasp King Hades' knees through the thick silk of his long robes.",
      "Tears fell from green eyes and down her lovely cheeks as she made the ancient gesture of supplication.",
      "His eyes glittered strangely and he sat, a tensed coil, watching her in deafening silence.",
      "Kore gasped for the right words. 'Will my Lord, o mighty Hades, tell me what manner of offence I have committed against your majesty, that I have been punished so cruelly?'",
      "Her voice sounded hoarse and raw, her mouth tasted of blood.",
      "Her eyes darted to the forearm of her captor and widened at the trickle of red streaming from the imprint of teeth there.",
      "His hand darted out to rest on her bent head, then gently swept back the curls that hid her face from him.",
      "Kore clung to his knees and tried not to flinch at the carressing touch.",
      "When he spoke, his voice was low and intimate''.",
      "'You have stolen from me, sweet Kore.'",
      "Her head shot up in astonishment, to see the corners of his mouth curl upwards in a mirthless smile.",
      "Relief flooded her.",
      "It was a simple misunderstanding. 'Majesty, I have not.",
      "I have taken nothing from you, I...I wouldn't.'",
      "He frowned slightly, Hades was not a being that was often contradicted. 'I say that you have.",
      "You stood before me at Olympus, since then, I have had no peace of mind.",
      "You stood within the circle of my arms, and now they can find no comfort.",
      "Since you bestowed on me a humble bloom, I have had no joy in all the riches of the earth.'",
      "Kore, horrified by his tender passion, tore her hands away from the backs of his knees and scrambled away from him.",
      "A single strand of her hair remained caught in his hand and he wound it around his forefinger. 'I do not seek to punish you, little one.",
      "Merely to put you where the fates have decreed that you belong.",
      "By my side, crowned and named as Hades' queen.'",
      "Kore, white faced, sat on the bottom step of the dias.",
      "Her mind was a whirl.",
      "Hades wanted her.",
      "He wanted to wed her.",
      "He would have her regardless of her inclination, was it not the way of things for women?",
      "His voice was calm and soft but Kore heard the edge of implacability that resonated from the King.",
      "In this moment, with the evidence of his power beaten into the very walls of his palace, Kore was not going to court his anger.",
      "She wanted to survive, she wanted to see her mother again.",
      "Mother would find a way to free her, but until then, it was up to Kore to use all the cunning of the fabled Odysseus and out manouver the King.",
      "How many people had crossed Hades and lived?",
      "She swallowed the bile that rose in her throat and gave an almost imperceptible nod.",
      "Hades noticed it and some of the tension left him. 'You do me great honor, my Lord.'",
      "The girl rasped and could say no more.",
      "It was courteous and utterly an unobjectionable thing to say to a betrothed husband.",
      "He stood and reached down to aid her to her feet, for an instant Kore battled with the desire to simply scream and flee when his hand pressed her to him.",
      "As his face neared hers, clearly intent on claiming her mouth, she recalled that there was no one to hear her screams and that here in the Underworld, there was nowhere to flee to.",
      "He surprised her by not pressing her lips to hers immediately, but instead kissing away the teardrops that she could not prevent from falling.",
      "Then his arms surrounded her, one hand burying itself in her hair to angle her head and he brought his mouth down to meet hers.",
      "She had always thought that kissing somebody was an odd thing to want to do, the act of putting ones face so close to a man's was surely an uncomfortable experience.",
      "Kore had been correct, at least, about it not being comfortable.",
      "She burned when fighting the waves of sensation and was further enflamed when she at last surrendered to him.",
      "A short time later, after which Hades heaved a sigh and ran a thumb over her swollen lips as he pressed a final kiss to her forehead. 'Kore will not do, you know.'",
      "he murmured in her ear, 'It will not do at all.",
      "When I crown you tonight, I shall give you a new name.",
      "You will not be a girl after today, my Lady.'",
      "He regarded her flushed face and rosy lips with apparent satisfaction. 'I shall crown you Queen Persephone, she who destroys the voices of mortal men.",
      "My wife.'",
      "Kore frowned in confusion.",
      "She had encountered very few mortals and had left them utterly unharmed by the encounter. 'I don't understand.'",
      "she whispered as he bent his dark head to press fervent kisses to her palms.",
      "He looked up at her question and his eyes were black and stormy. 'I guard what is mine.'",
      "he said, 'I shall be a jealous husband, Lady.",
      "I will bedeck you in precious, beautiful robes and then smite the eyes of those that linger on you for too long.",
      "Only I will whisper your name in hopeful entreaty.",
      "Persephone,' he breathed, ' I will put a curse on your name, that if it crosses the lips of a mortal it will mean the death of his voice.",
      "No mere man deserves the freedom of your name.",
      "The gods will call you my Queen and the world will know that you are entirely mine.'",
      "She swallowed but could not break her gaze from his.",
      "He seemed to be emitting tangible, violent power, but his face was set in tender lines as he looked at her.",
      "She dropped to her knees again to grasp his. '",
      "That is the second time you have done that, little one.",
      "The laws of Zeus are not supreme here, I am not obliged to grant you your request.",
      "Ask me anyway.",
      "Beg me.",
      "Entreat.",
      "Plead.",
      "I would not see you unhappy.'",
      "The maiden released his knees and bent her head. 'Lady Demeter, your Majesty.",
      "I should like to see her, please.",
      "I would have her know that I am unharmed.",
      "She will be so unhappy to find me gone.",
      "I beseach you, my Lord--give my mother some peace...tell her where I am.'",
      "He considered her request. '",
      "She cannot come here and I'll not take my wife above ground so soon after wedding her, 'tis unseemly.'",
      "The goddess at his feet waited. '",
      "But,' he said eventually, 'I shall arrange for a message to be taken to Hermes to deliver that you are safe and that she need not look for you.'",
      "He looked into her eyes and added, 'I shall present you in Zeus' court within the next year or so, you will see her then.'",
      "Kore lowered her eyelids so that her future husband should not see the resentment that must surely be evident. 'Thank you, my Lord.'",
      "For good measure, she kissed his hand. 'Are we to wed today, then?' 'Yes, by sunset.",
      "Your coronation also.",
      "My people will be assembled to greet their new mistress.'",
      "Kore tried for a neutral response. 'I shall try to be a good one, sir.'",
      "Unbidden, tears sprang from her eyes again and she brushed them away impatiently.",
      "Hades saw them and sobely said, 'I see you are overwrought.",
      "I will treat you well, Persephone.",
      "I do not wish for your unhappiness.'",
      "She almost railed at him then.",
      "That he should tear her from her home and then deny her her own mothe and claim that he cares for her happiness!",
      "Inwardly, Kore scoffed.",
      "She thought him presumptious, taking even her name from her.",
      "Perhaps, if she bided her time, there would be an evident escape from this place--although where she could hide afterwards was a mystery.",
      "It was clear that he'd not let his queen wander far, even if he did eventually tire of her.",
      "She had heard stories of his posessive nature.",
      "In that moment, hope seemed a fragile, distant thing.",
      "A cobweb that would be swept away by the howling wind.",
      "She clung to hope and tried to smile. 'Tis just that I am shocked, sir.",
      "I had not expected...any of this.'",
      "she made an expansive gesture with her hand, encompassing him, his throne room and the entire Underworld in the graceful turn of her wrist. 'I shall try to contain myself a little better, though I am not used to that either.'",
      "She thought of Demeters loving tolerance of her daughter's free and easy ways and nearly broke down. '",
      "If there is somewhere I might rest a while and refresh myself, I would be grateful.'",
      "Hades nodded once, watching her carefully as though the dam of her emotions might break forth at any moment, likely to knock him aside with their force.",
      "He took her hand and led her through high ceilinged, lofty rooms and a maze of airy hallways.",
      "Light flooded the palace but no torches burned and there was no sunlight to stream in from without.",
      "How then was the darkness kept at bay?",
      "It was a mystery that distracted her thoughts from the feel of Hades' hand firmly clasping hers.",
      "It occurred to her, as he led her to a luxurious chamber, that the darkest thing about the Underworld, was King Hades himself.",
      "Hope you enjoyed it, I found it preposterously hard to write!",
      "Sorry its been so very long between updates!",
      "Real life has been a bit mad and I've been tapping away at this chapter whenever possible.",
      "On the plus side, I've fleshed out the plot a but more and know where I am going, hopefully the words should come a but more easily to me.",
      "(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)",
      "Persephone did not sleep, the gods so rarely do after all.",
      "Instead, she sat stiffly on a delicate, gilded chair and shut her eyes against the sumptuous furnishings.",
      "She knew two things for certain.",
      "Firstly, if she did not escape from this strange realm of Hades' then she would be wed by nightfall.",
      "Secondly, there was no escape from the Underworld.",
      "They had crossed the river Styx by boat, the murky waters that the gods swore their oaths by.",
      "Hermes, the messenger with the winged sandals told her that he was the only one who could cross it without recourse to the wooden boat.",
      "Persephone did not think it at all likely that the boatman would risk the wrath of dark Hades to aid her return home.",
      "It seemed that she was stuck here, for the time being, at least.",
      "She knew her mother would not rest until she was found and back where she belonged.",
      "Demeter could petition Hera and Zeus to make her marraige disappear.",
      "Perhaps there was hope after all.",
      "She could return to the world she understood and answer to the name bestowed upon her by a loving mother.",
      "The hours slipped by, she felt the room chill slightly and when she opened sore, red rimmed eyes she saw that the shadows had lengthened and that a dusky blackness had crept in through the window.",
      "Persephone frowned in confusion.",
      "It was impossible that the sun could shine so far beneath the earth, how then was there sunlight and a sunset?",
      "Despite herself, she gave into her curiousity and wandered to the window.",
      "She did not need to lean out far before discovering the source of what little light there was left.",
      "An immense ball of fire burned in the center of a great open space.",
      "Scores of shades were hanging coloured jewels around it, blocking out its rays.",
      "Currently, they rushed to the firey ball with rubies and the light turned rosy and warm as it shone through them.",
      "She felt a heavy hand rest on her shoulder.",
      "She jumped. '",
      "It is the core of the earth, my Lady.",
      "My subjects call it our nether-sun.",
      "It serves us well enough for light and warmth but has to be hidden at night.",
      "The shades you see there have been sentenced to a hundred years of making the nether-sun rise and set.",
      "In a while they will block it out with obsidian.' 'It is very like the sun, above.'",
      "she replied, glumly. 'Does it cause flowers to open their petals also?'",
      "Hades shook his head. '",
      "The flowers down here are rather different, my sweet.",
      "They bloom as they are required to, and that is not so very often.'",
      "Kore shivered and Hades led her away from the window to a roaring fire that crackled in a marble hearth.",
      "The door to the chamber opened and servants came in bearing armfuls of dresses and jewelled sandals.",
      "Hades bent his dark head to her and she noticed that he had discarded his armour for an embroidered cloak trimmed with sleek black fur. '",
      "These are your maids, they are here to dress you for your bridal feast.",
      "I hope my gifts please you as much as it pleases me to bestow them.'",
      "His hand gently pushed back a heavy lock of hair from her shoulder and his fingers rested there a moment.",
      "She was conscious of the intimacy of it all, the rush of warmth to her skin where he touched and dreadfully aware of the servants who were studiously looking anywhere but at their King.",
      "Hades pressed his lips to her cheek and murmured in her ear, 'Tonight the Underworld shall gain a Queen of unparalleled beauty.",
      "I shall see you anon, fair Persephone.'",
      "He was out of the room before she and the waiting women could rise from their curtsies.",
      "The women, who were almost certainly mortal came forward to comb her hair and draw her to a golden tub filled with heated water.",
      "Persephone had only bathed in cool streams and rockpools before and found the experience very strange, but not entirely unpleasant.",
      "When she rose from the sweetly scented water, the women--who largely remained silent, draped her in a gown that was made of gold.",
      "It shimmered as they arranged it around her carefully.",
      "Golden sandals were slipped on her feet and the leather was so soft she could have been walking on a mossy lawn.",
      "She sat through their careful preparations passively enough, allowing them to direct her head as needed for the elborate style they were braiding into her hair.",
      "A chest of jeweled hair ornaments was opened and presented for her approval.",
      "Kore gaped.",
      "Once, in her wanderings in the forests the nymphs had discovered a single emerald hidden in the hollow of a tree.",
      "There was no explaination for it being there and no obvious owner.",
      "The young goddess had held it up to the sunlight, entranced by the fire that seemed to live inside the stone.",
      "The beauty of its colour held her in awe.",
      "Her mother had told her that she needed to return it to the hollow, what use had they for the cold gems of the earth?",
      "Demeter had grown her a bower of roses to amuse her instead.",
      "All the riches of the earth belonged to the Rich One himself, she said.",
      "Hades, having no use for life or love, hoarded his wealth possessively.",
      "Demeter told her of the great value of the stone, that its price would feed, clothe and house a large mortal family for years to come.",
      "Kore had heeded her mother's words and returned the emerald, but every so often revisted the tree, just to look at the stone again.",
      "The chest in front of her was overflowing with rubies, diamonds, emeralds and saphires-- each worth a kings ransom.",
      "She pointed to the emeralds and the women wove them skillfully into her hair.",
      "By the time she was declared ready, torches had been lit around the room.",
      "Her head felt heavy with the wealth that nestled in her shining curls and her heart felt heavier still with the increasing certainty that she might never again be the same.",
      "A strange kind of dignity held her upright in the midst of her absolute despair.",
      "The resolution that if this were to be her fate she would face it with the courage of a woman.",
      "A stronger courage than that of men, they would fight and rail against their destiny but a woman would make of it what she could.",
      "Such was the lot of women, even amongst the gods.",
      "Persephone straightened her shoulders and lifted her chin.",
      "She could not quite manage a smile, perhaps that would come later.",
      "She nodded gravely to the women who had adorned her with such care and thanked them.",
      "She did not smile at the shock they displayed.",
      "Hades clearly did not treat his mortal slaves with any kind of civility.",
      "They flanked her, as she stepped out of the chamber to turn down vaulted hallways.",
      "One day, she would stop to look at the fresco's and tapestries that covered the walls, but not tonight.",
      "For now, she would glance neither to the left, nor to the right in curiousity.",
      "Hades sat in his throne room, surrounded by a multitude of his subjects.",
      "As she approached him, they parted like a field of wheat and cried. '",
      "She comes!",
      "She who is honoured by Lord Hades, our great King.",
      "Blessings upon the union that brings Springtime to the Underworld.'",
      "Hades saw her and rose, extending a white sceptre for her to kiss, She did so and tried not to stare at him staring at her.",
      "His was not a face that smiled easily, she realised, but the slight upward lift of his lips and the crinkle in the outward corners of his eyes indicated that he was pleased.",
      "He waved his hand and drums began to beat out a stately tattoo.",
      "The deep sound echoed long, if the mortal above heard it they would quake in terror. 'I, Hades have commanded your presence here to witness the coronation of my Queen.",
      "Upon her head, I will place the diadem of shadows-- she is as eternally bound to me as my own.'",
      "The assembly murmured its approval and the drums beat louder. '",
      "In her hand, I shall put the sceptre of time--it is hers to bestow on those who are subject to it.'",
      "Persephone blinked, but remained silent as she gripped the carved ivory.",
      "The beat of the drums grew louder yet and Hades lifted his voice in one final declaration. '",
      "Around her shoulders, I drape the mantel of my protection, woe to any being that causes her to have need of it.",
      "My wrath will be told in the screamings of their agony, forevermore.'",
      "He took her hand in his. 'I present my Queen, Persephone.",
      "Go forth and tell the realms of her beauty and grace.",
      "Her name is cursed, no one shall utter it twice--it is mine.",
      "Kneel.",
      "Acknowledge her as mine, proclaim her as her majesty requires.'",
      "The drums ceased and the echo of their beat faded and died.",
      "For a split second, silence descended on the Underworld, even the souls in Tartarus ceased their tormented cries.",
      "Then a great roar went up, as loud as anything the young Queen had ever heard and she resisted the urge to cover her ears.",
      "Hades raised his hand again and soft pipes and strings began to play a slow, sensual music.",
      "Servants came in, laden with trays of food and pitchers of wine.",
      "Hades leant down to whisper in his wife's ear.",
      "The longest feast on Oympus lasted for three days and nights.",
      "In your honor...Hades' realm shall banquet for yet one more.'",
      "Her husband (oh the strangeness of it all!)",
      "led her to a table and laid her down next to it, cushions of satin were aranged about her and then he took his place opposite her.",
      "Servants hurried over, presenting golden platters to their King and silver ones to the Queen.",
      "Persephone, as she must be known now, took a selection of meats and fruits, dismissing the girl with a nod of thanks.",
      "Hades took from his platter, food like she had never seen before. '",
      "What manner of food is that, Lord Hades?",
      "I have never encountered it.'",
      "He licked the juice from his thumb before answering her. 'You may address your husband as Hades, Persephone.'",
      "His voice deepened and slowed when he spoke to her.",
      "Her name was a carress on his tongue. '",
      "The plates of gold bear the food of the dead, it carries with it a curse- those who eat of it are forever bound to me and my /lands.'",
      "He smiled briefly at the speed in which his bride dropped her grapes. '",
      "The /food before you is, of course, from the world above.",
      "Your soul is yet your own.' 'Why, sir?",
      "You have decreed me wife and Queen.",
      "It is permanent is it not?'",
      "She raised curious eyes to his face and lowered them again quickly, his gaze was penetrating and she would not have him know the reason for her questions. 'Am I not bound here, and to you, regardless?'",
      "His reply fed her hope. 'Marraige can be disolved and Queens can be toppled.",
      "The first would require the consent of Hera, who has never given it, the second is at my behest.'",
      "He drunk from his goblet and continued. 'I am known for my unchanging nature, wife.",
      "I shall not give you up.'",
      "His expression was dark and fierce until he saw the naked fear in her eyes.",
      "The black look on his face became less so, but his tone was implacable when he spoke again. 'I know what you are thinking of, Lady wife.",
      "Your mother may try to take you from me.",
      "Heed my warning, gentle Persephone, it is not wise to take that which belongs to Hades, but I would have you surrender your very soul to me by your own will.'",
      "She cast her gaze down to her plate and ran her finger around the edge.",
      "A pattern of flowers and wheat was painted onto the rim.",
      "It had been made for her, a silver plate for springtime.",
      "Kore pushed it away, she could not banquet as a Queen whilst her mother would be in agonies. 'Will you spare my dear mother for doing as she must?",
      "It would be against her very nature to not seek me out and try to bring me home again.'",
      "His eyes were flinty, reminding her of the obsidian that now cloaked the nether-sun. 'Persephone.",
      "You are home.",
      "Your mother will feel my displeasure should she try to take you.",
      "As for you, my Queen.",
      "Wander anywhere you please in your kingdom...but do not venture to cross the Styx without me.",
      "You would not like the consequences of my anger any more than I should like to impose them, but do not mistake that for unwillingness.",
      "I have you, and I shall certainly keep you.'",
      "Hope faded once more to a gossamer thin thread and tears burned in Persephone's eyes.",
      "Her throat closer and her voice would not obey her.",
      "She settled for a nod to her unbending husband and concentrated on skinning a peach.",
      "Queen Persephone, looking back, would often say that those first days of banquetting were a strange, thrumming, blur.",
      "The music was loud, the dancing primal and the drink stronger than anything she had ever had.",
      "Certainly, she drank too much wine-- but rather thought that the ever watchful eyes of Hades were headier than the effects of strong drink.",
      "He carried her off to his bed, after the feasting was over, kissing her mouth as the shades were changing the jewels around the nether-sun for a riot of reds and pinks.",
      "They had created a glorious sunrise in honour of her marraige and all Persephone could think of, as her husband loomed over her, was that the very light around them looked like blood.",
      "After that, she was Kore no more.",
      "Hope you enjoyed it!",
      "Please let me know if you did.:-)",
      "The Blossomming of Springtime: Chapter 4 Persephone sat, arrayed in splendid robes, beside Hades in the cavernous throne room.",
      "The sheer number of matters brought before the judgement of the king was incredible.",
      "Hades dealt justice swiftly and tirelessly.",
      "Occaisionally, a pitiful soul would take note of the silent goddess beside the judge and threw themselves on her mercy, hoping for her intervention.",
      "When this happened, Hades would gravely turn to his wife and name the price of his mercy.",
      "It was usually a kiss or an embrace.",
      "Persephone had little enough mercy to spare for the shades who expected her to pay the price for their misdeeds.",
      "She had done nothing but exist, and no gentle deity had yet come to alleiviate her suffering.",
      "She often wandered the Underworld alone, reluctantly curious about its workings and laws.",
      "Hades did not place onerous restrictions on her explorations.",
      "He told her to not attempt to cross the wide river Styx and to stay away from Tartarus.",
      "She supposed that she was either very cowardly or very sensible, because she had no desire to disobey him.",
      "In fact, she was a very obeidient wife, she aceeded to his every request and edict.",
      "If he noticed that she did not go beyond that in trying to please him, he did not remark on it but as the days passed she observed that Hades' commands to her became more gently worded, so that they almost sounded like requests.",
      "On the thirteenth day of her captivity, Persephone wandered to the farthest reaches of the realm, where the light of the Nether-sun barely reached and the land stretched out empty and desolate.",
      "Few shades wandered there, and those that did would not approach the beautiful woman whom Hades had claimed.",
      "The unhappy Queen sunk to her knees, disregarding her fine robes and dove her dainty fingers deep into the soil.",
      "It was moist and warm and it felt like home.",
      "She called to the earth to produce and concentrated on nurturing the tiny seedling that sprouted.",
      "Her tears watered the young life and it sprung up.",
      "It matured quickly into a tree of some sort, a willow perhaps- but unlike anything she had created before.",
      "In her old life, the plants and trees that she had occaisionally formed sprung up joyous and cheerful, reaching up to the bright sky.",
      "Not so here.",
      "The willow branches drooped and gracefully grew back down to the ground.",
      "It looked, she thought, as though it were weeping, and was comforted by the thought.",
      "She visited that spot every day, it was as far away from Lord Hades as she could get and, by growing a new tree with each visit, she could number the days of her separation from her mother.",
      "By the time Hermes sought an audience with her husband, she had created a woodland of over a hundred trees.",
      "She found a strange contentment in the gloom of her wood, the shades of Elysium would sometimes come to see, and then depart --the weeping trees were too sorrowful for their blissful existence to bear.",
      "Her favourite tree was her first.",
      "It grew tall and strong, but its leaves and branches remained adamantly bowed in sadness, when she rested her head against the rough trunk, Persephone almost felt she had a sympathtic friend.",
      "A slave, whose name she had no desire to learn, approached her. '",
      "His Majesty requests that you attend him in the throne room, my Queen.",
      "The messenger has come.'",
      "Persephone nodded once.",
      "In a fit of pique, she shrouded her favoured retreat in a shadowy mist, she preferred not to use the powers that her husband had conferred on her but today she would make an exception.",
      "She entered the throne room quietly, to find Hades in deep discussion with Hermes, the messenger god.",
      "She knew him by sight and reputation, but had never had cause to speak to him.",
      "It was doubtful he would know her.",
      "She bowed her head to Hades, respectfully, who stood and extended his hand. '",
      "My Queen,' he murmured, kissing her fingertips.",
      "Persephone smiled slightly and turned her curious gaze to the visitor. 'Honoured Hermes.",
      "What brings you to my husband's court?",
      "Is all well in the world above?'",
      "She did not dare speak more than that.",
      "Not with her Hades' cold fingers tightening- in a warning- about hers. 'Fair Queen.",
      "It is well met, a thousand blessings upon your marraige, my lady.'",
      "Hermes looked admiringly at her and she nodded slightly in response to his greeting.",
      "The messenger glanced at Hades and something in the Kings face made him avert his eyes from the beauteous goddess before him. 'Alas, Majesties, I bear bad tidings from the earth above.",
      "Demeter greives most sorrowfully for her departed child, and hunts high and low for the young maiden.",
      "I am charged by mighty Zeus, to seek out any who might have seen her or have news.'",
      "In response to this speech, Hades tugged on her hand, bringing Persephone closer to him.",
      "He breathed in her ear, 'be silent, sweet wife,' before turning to Hermes and gravely saying, 'has no word been received by the harvest goddess, regarding her daughters safety?",
      "Tell me, o fleet footed Hermes, what has been done?'",
      "He gathered his queen close to him, bringing her head against his broad shoulder and continued, 'My gracious wife is not to be troubled in this.",
      "It is of course, upsetting to one so tender hearted as she.'",
      "Hermes stared, as the most ancient of the gods put a hand on the lithe waist of the beautiful woman in his arms.",
      "He had not heard of Hades' marraige, not until setting foot in this spendid court and seeing the pair of thrones on the dias.",
      "He could not tell whether the young thing was mortal or otherwise.",
      "She was lavishly arrayed, with many jewels wound about her neck and arms, lovely arms- he couldn't help but note.",
      "All of her was lovely actually, slender and etheral but with such an aura of sadness that Hermes found himself longing to comfort her.",
      "He felt the searching gaze of Hades upon him and wisely ended his train of thought.",
      "The souls of the Undeworld whispered that Hades' myterious power was so great that he could gather the thoughts of men and examine them.",
      "Hermes did not like to risk underestimating him.",
      "Hephaistus had recently incurred Hades wrath for some reason and had yet to leave his workshop since.",
      "No hammering had been heard within for many days. '",
      "The Lady Demeter has searched every favoured corner that Kore has been, my Lord.",
      "The nymphs who were the child's constant companions say only that they were awakened by an earthquake and saw no sign of the girl.",
      "Great Poseidon has agreed to search the oceans and her father Zeus, who commands the world above leads the hunt there.",
      "He entreats you, my Lord, in a gesture of friendship to search your realms for the girl, Kore.",
      "Pity for Demeter!",
      "Pity for the lost child!'",
      "Hades very deliberately held -the now silently sobbing- Persephone closer to him. '",
      "It is unnessesary, Hermes, for me to search my own kingdom for Demeters offspring.",
      "I know well who enters and leaves my lands.",
      "There is no maiden called Kore here.'",
      "Hermes bowed. 'I thank you, Sire.",
      "I shall bear your information back above.",
      "Are there any messages you would have me take with me, Your Majesty?",
      "Shall I tell the gods of your illustrious marraige, of your kingdoms great wealth and its queen's remarkable beauty?'",
      "Hades considered. '",
      "By all means,' he said smoothly. 'Tell them that even the eternal shades in Elysium press their faces into the dust at her approach, that she commands the shadows and can halt the very progression of time.",
      "It is a worthy queen that I have crowned.'",
      "Hermes bowed. '",
      "And may I take back with me the name of this paragon, o most ancient one?' 'Her name is mine.",
      "It is cursed.",
      "Extol her virtues and her titles, the Queen of the Underworld, will suffice.'",
      "Hermes brows rose at this, but glancing once more at Hades he simply bowed and bid them farewell.",
      "He did not linger in Hades' kingdom, but instead flew quickly forth to the world above.",
      "Persephone wrenched herself away from her husband and fled from the throne room.",
      "If even Hermes could not know that she had been taken, what chance had Demeter to find her and bring her home?",
      "She retreated to her wood and did not emerge until sunset.",
      "She had underestimated the tenacity of her mother, however.",
      "The next time Hermes came, he bore the news that Helios had told Zeus of her capture, having seen it from his high vantage point when he crossed the azure heavens.",
      "Hermes stood before Hades and demanded the safe return of Kore. '",
      "My Lord, Demeter grieves.",
      "She permits nothing to grow on her beloved earth whilst her daughter is not with her.",
      "The world is covered in ice and snow.",
      "Mortals are dying, sire.",
      "Famine is taking the lives of many.",
      "I beseach you, majesty.",
      "Return the maiden to her mother, Zeus commands it.'",
      "Persephone had only known Hades for half a year, but even she, who avoided him when ever possible, could tell that this was a disastrous speech for Hermes to have to utter.",
      "Hades sat, stone-like in his glittering chair, his hand clenching his sceptre.",
      "The god was furious. '",
      "So, Demeter neglects her solemn duty and expects to command me with it through Zeus, does she?",
      "I have a message for you to take back, boy.",
      "Fly swiftly with it.",
      "There is no maiden to return.",
      "She is mine.",
      "Shall I also refuse to do my duty, shall I leave the mortals slain by Demeters treachery on the brink of death, with no release from agony?",
      "Think on that before you bring me more messages of insolence.",
      "Hades shall war with the earth and the oceans before my wife is taken from here.'",
      "Persephone cleared throat. 'Honoured Hermes.",
      "I would have you tell my mother that I am safe, if you please.",
      "Tell her that Kore is indeed no more, but that Persephone beseaches that she look to her duty, as I must look to mine.",
      "Tell her...tell her that my love for her is as it ever was.'",
      "Hermes nodded, understanding with the ease of long diplomacy, what was unsaid. '",
      "My Lady, will you not elect to come with me now?",
      "Your mother would be overjoyed...' Hades rose to his feet and a black spear appeared in his hand. 'Silence!",
      "O theiving Hermes.'",
      "Hades, with a swift thrust of his arm let loose the spear to fly over the messengers head.",
      "It sailed the length of the court and embedded itself deep into the beaten metal of the doors. '",
      "Ill not shed blood before her, but I will have your head and your heart beneath her feet if you continue.'",
      "Persephone, seeing the simmering rage of Hades, stood by him and laid a hand on his. 'Peace, I beg you, my Lord.",
      "I would not wish for blood to be spilled on my account.'",
      "She spoke to Hermes who was backing away towards the, now ruined, doors. 'Fly, Hermes.",
      "I cannot leave this place.",
      "Kore is lost.'",
      "Hermes fled, his winged sandals making him speed back to the world above.",
      "Persephone wondered whether the god would prefer to face the wrath of Zeus or Hades.",
      "It was likely that he would face both in a short span of time.",
      "Hades wound his arm about her waist and drew her close. 'Sweet wife.'",
      "He murmured, his lips ghosting over hers, 'you cannot bear violence.",
      "I wonder how your gentle heart must ache to sit beside me so silently, as I condemn the guilty to eternal suffering.",
      "Would you intercede if you could, hmm?'",
      "She looked up at him.",
      "One surprising thing about Hades, for all his humourless gravitas, was that his mind flitted about in a manner that she could not fathom.",
      "There seemed to be no logic or straight path between his conversation and his actions. 'I would not be so unwise as to undermine any ruling of yours, my King.'",
      "His eyes glitterred like jewels and he swiftly kissed her. 'Come dine with me, Persephone.'",
      "was all he said, and he led her to the dining hall.",
      "The Queen sat listlessly as he made up a silver platter of fruits for her, her mind was elsewhere, wondering where Demeter was at this moment and what her mother was doing to plan her rescue.",
      "It bolstered her spirits a little, to think that now her mother knew of her whereabouts, she would surely come and she ate what was on her plate more eagerly because of it.",
      "She picked up a pomegranate, breaking it and pulling out the seeds.",
      "The juice spread over her fingers, dark and red.",
      "Hades watched her, his own golden platter remaining untouched.",
      "Perhaps the food of the dead was not to his liking tonight, he was still and calm, but to his young wife, he seemed almost anxious.",
      "She had swallowed half of the seeds before she realised, with a flash of betrayal, the reason for his strange demenour.",
      "The pomegranate in her hand fell to the floor and she rose in her distress. 'Hades.",
      "What have you done?",
      "You have tricked me.'",
      "He stood to catch her as she stumbled, but she shied from him.",
      "Persephone, desperate, attempted to return the food from her body, with her fingers.",
      "Hades--merciless, trecherous and without remorse--grasped her wrist and prised her hand from her throat. '",
      "No, Persephone!",
      "Do you hear me?",
      "No!'",
      "and he held her to him, watching as wept bitter tears of betrayal.",
      "She pushed at his chest, trying to free herself.",
      "She felt something strange and indefinable shift inside her and knew that he had won.",
      "He released her, and looked agitated when she dropped to her knees.",
      "She looked blankly up at him, months of repressed anger blazing in her eyes. 'You have decieved me, Hades.",
      "You have tricked me into eating the food of the dead.",
      "I will never, never forgive you.'",
      "She did not shout or rail at him, her words were soft and assured.",
      "Her husband reached out hand, hovering above her but not daring to touch.",
      "She wondered bitterly why he abstained now.",
      "He had never cared for her opinion before, he had even taken her soul without her leave.",
      "He crouched beside her crumpled figure. 'Persephone.",
      "Zeus would have prevailed on Hera to take you from me.",
      "I have spies.",
      "I know that she was weakening against him.",
      "I cannot, I will not give you up.'",
      "Persephone pressed her wet face into her hands. 'Let me go.",
      "Send me home to my mother.'",
      "she commanded.",
      "Her husband closed his eyes, his mouth was pressed closed and he shook his head.",
      "She looked up after a moment of silence to see agony on his features. 'I hate you.'",
      "She whispered.",
      "His eyes flew to hers, shocked disbelief written in them and with a muted cry of grief, Hades turned on the spot and disappeared before her despairing eyes.",
      "Persephone, the unwilling Queen, drew all the shadows about her, hiding herself in them.",
      "For the first time, the darkness comforted her.",
      "Thank you so much for your kind responses.",
      "I know its been ages- sorry!",
      "She spent the hours of darkness in her woodland, making the fog so thick that she herself could barely make out the shadowy trees.",
      "It did not take long for her anger and sense of betrayal to subside and for fear to take its place.",
      "What had she been thinking, to speak to Hades so?",
      "It mattered not at all that it was the truth; he had power over her.",
      "She may be immortal, but she knew very well that she was not immune to pain...and she had seen him callously inflict that often enough in her time as his wife.",
      "If only she could erase the memory of his expression when she had told him of her hatred.",
      "His ordinarily inscruitable demeanor had become an open book to her for that moment.",
      "She had hurt him with her venom, and she found little satisfaction in it- she wished that she did.",
      "It was not in her nature to wish pain on anyone.",
      "All her life, her mother had taught her to treasure life, to be as gentle with others as she was with her most delicate blooms.",
      "Sometimes, she forgot and always felt dreadful for it later.",
      "Anger always left her feeling hot and prickly, sick to her stomach and wishing to return to her normal placidity.",
      "She leant against a drooping tree, too unsettled to even think of making another sapling spring up.",
      "Persephone, absorbed in her turmoiled thoughts, at first failed to notice the tall figure watching her silently from a short distance.",
      "The thick fog dissipated around him, but he left the rest of the wood shrouded in darkness.",
      "When she looked up and saw him, he approached. 'Husband.'",
      "she said in greeting.",
      "He bowed stiffly and her brows rose, unseen in the darkness. 'I am to take you to Olympus, Persephone.'",
      "Hades spoke, softly.",
      "Whatever she might have expected him to say, it had not been that.",
      "She looked at him in blank astonishment.",
      "The corner of his mouth twisted downwards. 'Zeus wishes to verify your safety.",
      "Hera says that our marraige requires her blessing.'",
      "His distainful opinion of his sisters boon was clear, and Persephone- for the first time, felt the urge to laugh.",
      "She contented herself with a cautious nod.",
      "Hades came closer. 'Your mother will be there.",
      "It is likely that she will petition my brother for your return.'",
      "Hades said it tonelessly, but his wife took silent note of his clenched fingers and drew her own conclusions. 'When?'",
      "She enquired, trying not to sound too hopeful.",
      "She had insulted him quite enough as it was.",
      "He made an impatient gesture with his hand. '",
      "Do you know, little one, that you are the most unfathomable creature I have ever dealt with?'",
      "She couldn't help it.",
      "A watery chuckle escaped.",
      "Hades blinked and explained. 'I seem incapable of divining your thoughts.",
      "Your soul is mine, your hand and your body are mine, but the contents of that pretty head are a mystery to me.'",
      "Hades came closer to her and put an arm either side of her, leaning against the tree.",
      "It reminded her of that first journey in his chariot. '",
      "We leave immediately,' he said, finally answering her question. '",
      "But first, I want something that has eluded me since I first laid eyes on you.'",
      "His eyes were level with hers and he was so close, she could feel his breath on her cheek as he spoke.",
      "He slowly brought his hand, always graceful- despite its latent strength, to rest on the skin of her shoulder.",
      "It was heavy and warm against her skin.",
      "She felt his power swirl about them the moment before he concentrated it on her.",
      "Her husband dropped his voice to a whisper, 'Sweet wife, my very bones ache for a crumb of your affection.",
      "You come from the warm world above, having basked in the sunlight all your life...but you spare no warmth for me.",
      "I have been cold, Persephone, as ice, for so long.'",
      "Persephone heaved great gulping breaths of air as Hades pressed close to her.",
      "She could not look away, could not break the burning gaze of her husband.",
      "She felt his power seep into her body from his fingertips, knew the very moment control was wrested from her and in that moment launched herself at him, suddenly filled with such fierce desperation that she could hardly think.",
      "She wound her arms about his neck, needing to be nearer still as she kissed him with a passion that she did not know she possessed.",
      "He groaned and crushed her to him, she felt the rough bark of the tree to her back and the coolness of his plated armour to her chest.",
      "A fire raged through her body, she was wild for his kisses and in that moment felt as free and incandescently happy as she ever done in her life.",
      "When she wound her fingers into the thick, oiled locks at his nape, he gave a strangled cry- releasing her and stepped back.",
      "She slid down against the tree to the floor, boneless and unable to stand.",
      "The controlling power of Hades that had overtaken her soul left as abruptly as it had come and still she could not will her trembling to cease and cold reason to return.",
      "Persephone sat, wide eyed and panting as Hades flung himself to rest against a nearby tree.",
      "For a treacherous moment, even with the certainty that he had just used his treacherously gained power over her in order to awaken her passion, all she wanted was to beg him to return to her-to kiss him again.",
      "She fisted the smooth silk of her gown in her hands and tried very hard not to watch the King as he so obviously fought an internal battle for self control.",
      "He rested his forehead against the trunk of the willow and would not look at her.",
      "The thick fog that shrouded the forest had receded somewhat and she could clearly see the agony writ across his features.",
      "How was it, she wondered, that his own control could have been so shattered by his manipulation of hers?",
      "Eventually, he raised his head to look at her and once more she could not read his expression. 'Come, my Lady Wife.",
      "We must away, to Olympus.'",
      "He stretched out a hand to aid her rising from the ground and she hesitated, afraid that if she touched his skin she would burn up all over again.",
      "He dropped his arm. 'Persephone...I'll not use my power over you again, fear not.",
      "I only...' He broke off, seemingly at a loss for words. 'I will not use your soul so, not again.'",
      "-------------- They rode in great state and ceremony to Olympus, Queen Persephone stood beside her husband in his chariot, suitably crowned and begowned.",
      "The three Furies flanked their chariot and Persephone, after staring at them in horrified fascination for several minutes was glad when Hades ordered them to keep their distance from them.",
      "The flapping of their immense wings created a strong wind, causing Persephone's hair and Hades' cloak to whip about behind them as they travelled.",
      "When they reached the great white palace of Zeus, commencing their walk upward, Persephone felt her stomach roil in anticipation.",
      "She would see her own dear mother in moments!",
      "Oh to feel Demeters safe arms around her once more, so different to the embrace of Lord Hades.",
      "She tried once more, to put the kiss in the willow wood out of her mind, but every now and then her husband's elbow would brush her upper arm as they walked and she remembered once again.",
      "A great fanfare of trumpets announced their arrival and Persephone heard the messenger, Mercury cry out. 'Harken, o great gods of Olympus!",
      "The great king and queen of the Underwold approach.",
      "All honour to them.'Persephone felt the eyes of the assembled gods on her as they approached Zeus, she would have curtseyed then but Hades hand on her waist stayed her.",
      "Hades gave a very slight bow to Zeus and a cool nod to Hera, who rose to greet them. 'Brother!'",
      "Boomed Zeus, his greeting clear and confident. '",
      "We welcome you once more.'",
      "The ruler of the heavens turned his bearded face slightly to look at Persephone, he smiled. '",
      "My Lady.",
      "We bid you welcome also, the Lady Demeter has been most anxious to see you once more.'",
      "Almost as soon as her name had left Zeus' lips, the harvest goddess broke free of the crowd that held her back.",
      "In a flurry of white robes, she was before her daughter.",
      "Demeter did not so much as glance at the forbidding figure of her brother, did not pause at the sight of the crown and rich gown her child wore.",
      "The mother opened her arms and with sobbing, heartfelt sigh of relief Persephone stepped into them.",
      "The women clung to each other, heedless of the multitude of eyes upon them.",
      "They did not see Hera raise a finger to dismiss the crowd, leaving the five of them left alone in the throne room.",
      "Persephone tucked her head beneath Demeter's chin and rested her cheek on her chest.",
      "Demeter was thinner, perhaps but still smelled of warmth and sunshine, that scent that meant comfort and safety.",
      "How good, how joyful it was to be in those beloved ams again!",
      "At length, Persephone gently drew away to an arms length and looked at Demeter.",
      "What she saw worried her.",
      "The fresh, beauteous face that smiled on the prosperity of the mortals was now withered and gaunt. 'Mother!",
      "Oh my dear one!",
      "What has happened to you?' cried the young Queen.",
      "Demeter's smile was brittle. '",
      "A curse.",
      "I left the world to famine and drought, hunting for you.",
      "The mortals pleaded for Zeus' intervention and when I refused to return to my duty...he punished me.",
      "My immortality cannot be touched, of course...but my eternal youth?",
      "Alas, I grow old now, as do the mortals.",
      "Oh, do not weep so, Kore!",
      "You are returned to me, I would bear a hundred such evils, to have you with me.'",
      "Hades spoke, derision dripping from each word. '",
      "She is not returned to you, sister.",
      "She is mine.",
      "Wives, once wed, do not return to the home of their maidenhood.",
      "It is not the way of things.",
      "I know that you have attempted to persuade Hera to disolve the match- can you imagine the evil that might spring from such a decision?",
      "That a bond may be broken and rent assunder?",
      "What chaos would spring up amongst the mortals.'",
      "Hades, reached out and clasping Persephone's shoulder, turned her about and brought her to his side once more.",
      "At his touch she tensed, once more the urge to kiss him surfaced.",
      "She wanted to reach up and wind her fingers into the hairs that curled into his nape, to bring his head down to hers and...",
      "Blushing she recollected herself, looking to the Goddess of Marraige, who was nodding in agreement with what her husband had said. 'Indeed, husband' said Hera lightly, 'enough mischeif is made already by marraiges being forsaken- if a precedent were set that they might be done away with altogether...it would be disastrous.",
      "Demeter must give up this madness and instead find solace in her duty.",
      "The child would have married regardless at some point anyway, it simply comes sooner than our sister had hoped.' 'No!'",
      "declared Demeter. '",
      "No. I should never have let her be at the cruel mercies of a man.",
      "I would have kept her with me, always.'",
      "she broke down, weeping.",
      "Persephone edged towards her mother and laid a hand on her shoulder. 'Mother...I...I have not met with cruelty.",
      "His Majesty has not injured me.'",
      "To her distress she saw that her mother did not heed her words, only moaned and hid her head in her hands.",
      "Zeus sighed. '",
      "This must be resolved!",
      "It can not go on as it is.",
      "The mortals are dying.",
      "Sister, will you not return to your harvest and your crops, knowing that your daughter is safe?'",
      "He recieved only a mutinous glare and a shake of the head in reply and turned to Hades. 'Brother.",
      "Will you release your Queen back to her mother's care?",
      "Have you compassion for the mortals?'",
      "Hades bared his teeth. 'You ask me that?",
      "You would dare?",
      "I'll not release her.",
      "You permit your mistress too much liberty if she thinks to neglect her duty and gain from it!",
      "Hear me, brother KIng.",
      "If anyone tries to take what is mine, I will not rest until I see them destroyed.'",
      "Persephone looked at her hands.",
      "She did not want that.",
      "She would not, could not wish for such violence to occur if she were gain her freedom.",
      "Her mother was wrong to inflict such great suffering on others, she loved her dearly for trying to bring her home to the bright happy meadow, but could not condone such widespread pain.",
      "How she wished, whole heartedly, that there were someway to assuage both of them. '",
      "Perhaps there is, noble Queen.'",
      "An eerie trio of voices spoke from behind he, as one.",
      "Persephone gasped and Zeus strode forward to greet the Fates.",
      "Three women, old and huddled together with tattered cloaks drawn over their heads.",
      "They ignored the mighty King of the gods and peered, squinting at Persephone. '",
      "A true and noble thought.",
      "She is fated to rule and fated to be both wife and daughter.'",
      "The three aged crones cackled together. 'It is a question of how.'",
      "Zeus, eager for a solution, asked, 'can there be an easy solution?",
      "How is it to be accomplished?'",
      "The three Fates turned their attention to him. 'Easy?",
      "Not so.",
      "Not for any of them, least of all for a Queen who commands time, she must be subject to it- must come and go at its passing.",
      "The solution can neither please all, nor injure any.'",
      "Hades quite pale and seeming to understand the strange, riddled speach of the women, murmured calmly, 'If that is the answer, the earth can expect to feel my wrath when she is not by my side.'",
      "The women bowed. '",
      "That is so, Great One.",
      "Your judgement is already written in the stars of the future.",
      "Nothing can be as it was.'",
      "The three joined hands and addressed the company.",
      "Even Demeter had risen from the floor and waited in anticipation for their pronouncement. '",
      "She who is both springtime and destruction, shall remain with her Lord for six months of each year, then must return to the light of the world above to the arms of Demeter, until such time as her destiny is put into her own hands.'",
      "With that astonishing declaration, the strange trio left the great hall as swiftly and as noiselessly as they had entered it.",
      "Thank you to those of you who have left a comment, its really nice to see that people are enjoying this.",
      "Its drought or drown with me, isnt it?",
      "Hopefully I'll be able to post more regularly now.",
      "Persephone lay on soft green grass, gazing up at the sky.",
      "Nymphs surrounded her but their merry chatter could not distract her from the fascination of the fluffy white clouds that passed overhead.",
      "It was an idle occupation, to spend hours on end just looking and smelling and...existing.",
      "Three months had passed since the Fates had given their verdict.",
      "It was decided that the Queen of the Underworld should commence her time with her mother immediately.",
      "It was the spee diest way, said Zeus, of ending the mortal suffering that Demeter had inflicted.",
      "Hades had looked sour when the harvest goddess had shot him a triumphant look over Persephone's head.",
      "They never spoke of him, not even when he sent messengers and gifts to the world above to ask how she fared.",
      "On the occaisions that message bearers entered her home, Demeter would absent herself and leave the diplomacy to her daughter.",
      "The goddess of the harvest made no effort to disguise her hatred of King Hades in those first days, she well nigh tore the fine robes and exquisite jewels off her child- all the while condemning the Lord of the dead for daring to take her.",
      "Persephone had remained silent, allowing Demeter to gently clothe her in the bright, beautiful cottons that she had always worn.",
      "The fabric felt strange to her, after so long spent in silk and fine lawn, perhaps she would have to become reaccustomed to it.",
      "She knew that her mother needed this, to brand her as her own again, after having searched frantically for her.",
      "She slept in her mother's arms that first night.",
      "Demeter held her close, as though to ward off Hades, should he come in the night to take her back below the earth.",
      "Persephone could not say that she missed her husband, she was too glad, too happy to be back with her mother to even think of it.",
      "Knowing that she would have to return to his side was a fact that she pushed to the back of her mind, she deliberately did not think of it.",
      "In fact, were it not for the frequent gifts that he sent and the fearful reverence that all -except her mother- now treated her with, Persephone could almost forget that she was a Queen, that she had slept in the bed of a King.",
      "She admired the beautiful gifts her husband sent and quietly put them away so as not to distress her mother.",
      "A nymph had had asked her once, within Demeter's hearing, how long she had left before she must go back to the land of the dead.",
      "The expression of blind panic in Demeter's eyes had hurt Persephone and she had not objected to the vines that sprang up from the fertile earth, choking the breath from the foolish companion.",
      "Her time as Hades' Queen had given her a sense of justice that balanced out her compassion.",
      "She was not the same as she was, she would not entirely wish to be.",
      "Three months.",
      "In three months time, she would come face to face with Hades again.",
      "Was he as daunting as she remembered?",
      "Would his kisses reawaken that terrifying fire that consumed her, that burning, dreadful heat that threatened to consume her so that she hardly knew herself?",
      "A nymph's persistant calling interrupted her reverie. 'Your Majesty!",
      "My lady!' 'What is it?' she murmured. '",
      "A mortal man approaches!",
      "He has the look of detirmination about him.'",
      "Her curiousity aroused, Persephone sat up and looked across the meadow, squinting her eyes against the sun.",
      "A grecian fellow walked steadily towards the group, a lyre slung across his back, his jaw set and eyes focused upon the young Queen.",
      "He sank to his knees before, his bent head level with hers.",
      "He did not speak but waited for her to acknowledge him.",
      "The nymphs tittered.",
      "Persephone raised her hand for silence.",
      "She felt, rather strongly, that this wretched mortal should be grovelling before a regal goddess on a throne rather than a slightly grubby and barefooted girl lying on the ground.",
      "She dismissed the thought however, and decided that her bearing would simply have to be queenly enough to make up for the rest of it. 'What is your name, sir?' 'I am Orpheus, noble queen.' 'And what is it that you want of me?' she queried.",
      "He did not look up, did not move from where he knelt. 'I would have your majesty hear my song, and take pity on my suffering heart.'",
      "It was a reasonable enough request, she supposed and it was a rather less lazy occupation than staring at clouds and trying not to think about Hades. '",
      "Well then, Orpheus,' she said softly, 'strike at your instrument and lift up your voice, my compassion is dependant on your skill.'",
      "He shifted then, seating himself comfortably, with the lyre held tenderly in his hands.",
      "His hands carressed the strings for a moment before he drew breath and begun his song.",
      "Persephone was enthralled as he opened his mouth to sing.",
      "Truly, this mere mortal had been blessed by the gods.",
      "His voice was as a rippling waterful, smooth and powerful and masterfully weilded.",
      "He sung of his love for Euridice, his wife.",
      "He wept in the telling of it, so great was his passion for her.",
      "Truth was evident in every part of his tale.",
      "Orpheus' compelling music wove its own story, of wicked satyrs stealing his love away from him- of his frantic search and his despair at the finding of the pit of vipers that ended poor Euridice's life.",
      "Not an eye was dry as the last chords of his mournful tune faded away.",
      "Somewhere, a far off a bird chirped unhappily.",
      "Even the animals wept with this man.",
      "Persephone stood up, blinking back tears. 'Very well, Orpheus- your sad tale has moved me.",
      "I would wish to help you.",
      "I will plead your case to my husband.'",
      "she grimaced at the thought of what her mother might say, that she was even considering visiting the Underworld when she was not obliged to.",
      "She pitied the bard though, and wished to aid him, even if it meant facing Hades sooner than necessary.",
      "She waved away the gasping nymphs impatiently and pinned Orpheus with a glare. 'Have you courage as well as song?",
      "We must descend to the place of the dead, it is a realm that mortals rarely return from.",
      "Your bravery will be put under great strain, if you do not do as you are required to, you will have to suffer the consequences alone, I will not petition King Hades twice on your behalf.'",
      "The man quaked visibly at her dire warning, but nodded in response. 'I will do whatever I must to see my wife again, as any man would do.'",
      "Persephone steeled herself. '",
      "Well then.",
      "Come.",
      "We have a long journey ahead.'",
      "She sent a dryad off to her mother, bearing the news that she would return by sunrise the next morning and the pair set off.",
      "She knew, from her time there, that there were many entrances to the Underworld- but precious few exits- especially if you were unfortunate enough to be mortal.",
      "It seemed that the most likely option today, would be to visit Acheron and its deep flowing river, to seek the ferryman that could bear them below the earth.",
      "Persephone did not relish the journey, but her heart was moved by the great pathos with which the poet spoke.",
      "She supposed that if she were ever to want her own sad tale told to the world, it would be Orpheus that ought to tell it.",
      "Not even the great Apollo plucked at his lyre with as much skill as this grieving husband.",
      "He entertained her as they travelled, with poems and tales that amused her immensely, she even found herself laughing lightly at Orpheus' accounting of the birth of Athene- she'd had no idea that the mortals possessed such strange imaginations.",
      "When they at last reached the banks of the Acheron, Orpheus' smooth voice came to an abrupt halt.",
      "Shades paced the shores moaning and wailing for peace and for passage across.",
      "They parted before the Queen and her quaking shadow.",
      "The ferryman bowed low when she raised her hand to him. 'I seek passage to the Underworld, along with this man.'",
      "She said, gesturing to Orpheus, who had gone quite white with his fear. 'Will you bear us across?'",
      "The silent, skeletal boatman simply bowed again.",
      "As with the first time she crossed the river, she felt his eyes on her the entire time- watching her from beneath the cowl of his hood.",
      "The boat glided smootly across the still, dark waters.",
      "Orpheus grew more and more tense beside her, his eyes fixed on the black river.",
      "She did not know what he saw in those waters, did not care to know- her own anxiety mounted as they approached the far shore, judging by the light, the first jewels of sunset were being hung.",
      "What would her husband say, would he be displeased at her presence here?",
      "Championing the cause of a bard?",
      "What would she say?",
      "They walked up to the palace, it was a winding, dusty climb, the dead bowed low at the sight of her, even without her royal robes and crown- perhaps she did not look so very common after all.",
      "She glanced down at her bare little toes peeping out from the grass stained hem of her chiton and let out of soft snort of self derision.",
      "She was fooling herself if she thought her appearance was in the least bit queenly.",
      "It was a problem that she would need to address once this adventure was done, she may be a wife for half a year and Springtime for the other but there must be some compromise to be reached in the matter of her dress.",
      "These thoughts occupied her attention as they passed through the great doors of the palace and into the throne room.",
      "It was brimming with petitioners, all begging for mercy from the King.",
      "Hades sat on his splendid throne, arrayed in a fine robe of black and gold- he looked as forbidding as he ever had.",
      "Perhaps more so.",
      "He looked up from the scroll he read from as Persephone, gesturing to Orpheus to keep up, walked through the crowd of souls that parted before them.",
      "She congratulated herself on the brief flash of shock that crossed his features- a slight widening of dark eyes and a twitch of the thick brows.",
      "She held her head high as she approached the dias and made her respectful curtsey.",
      "Her husband tossed aside the scroll and leant back on his throne, his expression was carefully neutral and his hooded eyes glittered.",
      "There was no point in denying to herself that physically speaking, he was handsome.",
      "His dark hair gleamed in the evening light, Persephone felt dreadfully inadequate in contrast to his regality- she flushed lightly as she remembered that she probably still had flowers woven into her locks. '",
      "My Queen has returned to me.",
      "Will she not assume her rightful place by my side,' he drawled, flicking a finger to her empty seat, 'or does she seek my favour as my subject?'",
      "She didn't understand exactly what he meant, perhaps he merely wanted her to acknowledge him as her husband, but she understood that her next words would be important.",
      "His attitude and demenour may look casual but the hand clutching the diamond studded arm of his throne was white with the force he gripped with. '",
      "My Lord husband...'",
      "She tentatively began, 'I would ask for private speech with your majesty, if I may.'",
      "She bit her lip.",
      "Hades did not move, did not take his eyes off his wife.",
      "Eventually, he lifted a finger slightly and softly said, 'As you command, my queen.'",
      "He raised his voice slightly to command the court to depart, Orpheus fidgeted beside Persephone until she curtly commanded him to wait outside the doors.",
      "Persephone heard the echoing clang of the doors closing behind sweet Orpheus.",
      "Alone with Hades, she was about to open her mouth to begin her petition on the mortals' behalf when Hades flung himself forwards from where he sat.",
      "She shut her mouth with a snap.",
      "A few long strides brought him close to her, towering over her and with his strong arms, he pulled her closer yet. 'Persephone,' he murmured, cupping her face in his hands and dragging his cool, firm lips accross her brow, 'tell me why you have come.'",
      "(See the end of the chapter for notes.)",
      "Persephone made her way to the double set of doors that stood closed at the far end of her husband's court.",
      "Cautious excitement bubbled up in her throat, perhaps her husband was not so completely unbending as she had once believed.",
      "She touched the handle, an onyx carving of a serpent with glittering sapphire eyes, preparing to wrench it open with all her might but was surprised when the door swung free at a gentle push.Orpheus, predictably, was white faced and anxiously waiting on the other side.",
      "Persephone smiled at him, relieved for his sake that there was hope.'Come forward, blessed Orpheus.",
      "My Lord Husband, the unbending King Hades has agreed to hear and consider your case- bring your lyre.'",
      "And with that, she turned on her toes and made her way back to the waiting King.His countenance, upon Orpheus' greeting and obeisance, could not have been less encouraging.",
      "To the widowers credit, his voice did not desert him in his fear and his hands, that had trembled visibly when he brushed the sweat from his brow, were steady and sure as he plucked at the lyre.Mournful notes filled the cavernous hall, Orpheus himself wept as he played- still Hades' face remained as hard as the diamonds that decorated his royal seat.",
      "When the last echoing note of Orpheus' plea faded into nothingness, Hades turned to his wife.'The mortal makes his case well,' he said lowly, 'you are not impervious to such tragedies then?",
      "You would have me permit a soul to leave my domain?",
      "I have never done so before.'",
      "Hades reached out his hand to her face and with a fingertip, traced the course of a tear down her soft cheek.",
      "The tear ran down to her jaw, Persephone held her breath as Hades, spellbound, watched it fall to her chest.",
      "Neither moved.",
      "A discordant, loud twang came from the man awaiting judgement and their majesties turned abruptly to regard him as he finished setting down his lyre.",
      "Hades scowled at Orpheus and the bard instinctively dropped to his knees.",
      "The King of the Underworld rose from his throne and moved to tower over his, still seated, wife.",
      "He bent to murmur in her ear, his lips a breath away from brushing against the lobe. '",
      "If I do this,' his voice was deep and gentle- like that of a lover, 'If I let him take back his wife, to please you, what are you willing to give me.'His Queen did not shrink away as she would have wished to, they were under observation and it would not help the cause of this poor man if she spurned mighty Hades' in front of him.",
      "She tilted her face towards him slightly, but kept her eyes on Orpheus- whose trembling had returned, he was about to lose his nerve.'There is nothing, Lord Hades, that I have, that you have not given me.",
      "I have no favours to grant that are not already yours to command.'",
      "she whispered smoothly, he withdrew slightly, at that and she carried on, pleading. '",
      "If there is something in particular that you would have me give, your majesty has but to name it.",
      "Take pity on this poor man, husband- I pity him, please...give him the chance at happiness.'Hades reached down and clasped her hand in both of his. 'Look at me.'",
      "He commanded, 'My compassion is not so absent as you might think, I will do this for you- but if I do, my price is yours to bear.'",
      "He raised her hand up to his unsmiling mouth, his eyes on hers.",
      "She stared at him, wide eyed.",
      "She raised her brows in enquiry, Hades turned over the hand in his and dropped another kiss on her palm.",
      "Persephone shivered. '",
      "It is simply this, when the time comes for to return to my side, you must do so as my willing wife.'She froze, ice encased her heart once more and, after the uncomfortable heat and flutterings that he had very recently aroused in her, she welcomed the clarity of the cold.",
      "Turning her face away she fixed her eyes on the unclaimed hand that lay idly in her lap. 'Are you asking me to walk down into your kingdom of my own accord, sir, or for me to fall in love with you?'An unyielding finger was pressed under her chin and her gaze forced to meet his once more.",
      "His eyes glittered, hard and as stern as ever they had been but his voice caught a little, as he spoke her name. 'Persephone, I will demand nothing else from you that you cannot willingly give.",
      "I want you to come home to me, your husband, without forcing me to wrest you from your mother's arms.'Her expression must have communicated her disbelief.",
      "He would not take what she did not wish to give him?",
      "He was Hades, there was nothing of hers that he did not own, that he had not already taken.",
      "Persephone set her jaw, she had promised aid to this mortal who, unlike the stone hearted individual before her, was capable of deep abiding love.",
      "Hades' Queen would finish what she started.'I have already demonstrated my willingness to return to your realm uncoerced, Majesty.",
      "What you ask is not so very great a price.'",
      "she said, coolly, 'You have my word, I shall come back to this realm without troubling you to fetch me.'Her acceptance of his terms did not, apparently, delight King Hades for he did not look in the least bit victorious.",
      "Hades dipped his head in a curt nod, and for the first time, turned to speak to Orpheus.'My Lady Wife has interceded for yours, mortal.",
      "You are to have the chance to return your wife to the land of the living.",
      "Harken to my words, Orpheus.",
      "Turn around, walk from here back up to the world above.",
      "Look neither to the left, nor to the right and on no account must you turn around.",
      "Euridice is behind you.",
      "If you look back into the land of the dead, there will be no second reprieve from me.",
      "Her Majesty has agreed to pay the price of my mercy, if you squander it- render it worthless- my wrath will fall on you.",
      "Go.'Persephone stood quickly. 'I will bear you company partway, Orpheus- I must return above also.'",
      "She curtseyed to Hades, 'I bid you a temporary farewell, my Lord.",
      "I will come back...willingly.'",
      "To her surprise, he smiled faintly. 'I do not doubt your word, Lady.",
      "Farewell, then.'Persephone stared blankly at him, for a moment, marvelling at how even the slightest softening of his face made him impossibly handsome.",
      "The unwelcome train of thought made her smile nervously back and hurry after Orpheus and the gliding glimmer of light that followed him.",
      "They walked in silence to the river, Orpheus was clutching his lyre so tightly that his fingers turned white from the pressure.",
      "Persephone tried to encourage him. 'Have faith, faithful Orpheus- your love is behind you, here is where we part.",
      "I will go on ahead of you, remain here and wait for the return of the ferryman.",
      "Do not look anywhere but onward!",
      "Do not waste your chance!'Orpheus, his eyes never leaving the point of light in the far distance, smiled tremulously. 'I owe you a very great debt, o gentle Queen!",
      "I will sing ballads in praise of your beauty and mercy until my dying day.'Persephone let out the ghost of a laugh. 'Perhaps not, mortal- it is best not to praise the fairness of one woman when your wife shadows behind you.",
      "There is one thing you may do for me, bard.",
      "Tell the tale of my abduction, sing of the resolution that the Fates dictated.",
      "Do not let the world forget that such a goddess as Kore existed, even though I may yet forget.",
      "Promise me, Orpheus, and your debt to me is forgiven.''My lady!",
      "Yes.",
      "I promise, I will not forget.'Persephone's shoulders sagged in relief, if the silver tongued Orpheus were to tell her sad story, the world would remember forever, she was sure of it.",
      "It was important, she felt, in these times of great upheaval and change, that her past be known.",
      "She was no longer 'Kore' and she could not be spoken of by the cursed name 'Persephone'.",
      "She had been fearful that she might fade into nameless obscurity if the truth were not known.'Well then, Orpheus, I wish you well.",
      "Keep your courage, she is close by you- if you do not falter, your happiness is attainable.'",
      "She looked behind him to Euridice, whose form and features were becoming clearer as she neared the entrance to Hades' realm.",
      "There was no expression to be seen on the womans' face yet, it was all an indistinct blur- but the shade raised her hand and Persephone knew instinctively, that it meant gratitude.",
      "The thanks lightened her heavy heart and she felt glad that someone so worthy should have their hearts desire.",
      "The ferryman bore the Queen back across the river and this time instead of feeling unnerved by his watchfulness, she lifted her chin and looked calmly back at him.",
      "She may be barefoot and clad like a common maiden, but she felt every inch a queen when the boatman turned his head and nervously averted his gaze.",
      "It was a petty victory, perhaps.Persephone, once more under Zeus' vast skies, saw that the stars were flung across the heavens and that Selene's moon shone brightly down upon her.",
      "The night was clear and warm, it would not be long before sweet Dawn brought morning to the world above.",
      "Walking home across fields of corn, skirting the sleepy houses that dotted the countryside, Persephone felt free.",
      "It was not often that she was truly alone, neither her mother nor her husband were likely to let her roam either world as she pleased, she relished the precious fragment of liberty that she had.",
      "She was smiling by the time she approached her mother's meadow, she saw Demeter waiting anxiously- looking out for her return and she sped up to meet her.Demeter scolded her daughter for going to see 'that man,' and Persephone, although trying very hard to understand her dear mother's worry, could not help but bristle slightly.",
      "She was the Queen of the Underworld, she had already faced the most terrifying thing imaginable, abduction by King Hades.",
      "What did Demeter think could happen to her here?",
      "That evening, she removed and twisted up her white gown, putting it aside to be washed in the stream.",
      "Perhaps tomorrow, she could think about weaving some new dresses- that would be to her liking and not given to her by a mother or husband.",
      "It might be possible to find something regal enough for her position and daughterly enough for Demeter.",
      "Humming softly to herself, Persephone settled down to watch the sunrise, so very different from the artifice of the new day in Hades' kingdom; not more beautiful necessarily, just different.",
      "She could find a sort of contentment in this odd life she had, this divided life in which she was both wife and daughter but never at the same time.",
      "She realised, with a start that she was not afraid to return to her husband when the time came, partially because there was an end to look forward to but also because he had treated her with consideration today.",
      "The dreaded Hades had upturned an eternity of precedent in order to please her, a slip of a girl who had no real importance, not even to the feeble minded mortals.",
      "Just the thought of it made her shake her head in absolute astonishment.",
      "The next chapter of this is already written and just needs editing, which I might have time to do after Christmas.",
      "Thank you for the lovely, supportive comments that you have left, it really does make a huge difference to how I feel about settling down to write.",
      "Oh and Marquesa, a couple of people have mentioned that you directed them to this...thank you so much.",
      "Thank you so much for all of your very kind responses!",
      "I'm not sure how its happened but my favourite story of mine, seems to be gaining interest!",
      "I'm sorry about the spacing in the last chapter, the lovely people at A03 are going to sort it out I think.",
      "Paragraphs seem to be working today.:)",
      "The remaining months of her time with Demeter flew by.",
      "It was plain to Persephone that her mother began to grieve her absence even before she left the happy, sunlit meadow.",
      "The weather in that last week, turned cooler and the fresh green leaves that adorned the forest trees began to wither and turn to browns and reds- nature mourned with Demeter.",
      "Persephone understood that anticipatory grief, even as it frustrated that her mother grew more morose- she wanted to enjoy what time they had left together.",
      "They breakfasted together, one morning.",
      "Worshippers had left beautiful, plaited loaves of bread at the temple and they ate it in silence under the bright warm sun.",
      "Once they had finished eating, Demeter reached out to take her daughter's hand, playing with the slender fingers. '",
      "It has brought me such joy, my darling, to have you here with me.",
      "For a while...I feared that I should never see you again- I feared that somehow you had perished, alone and away from me.'",
      "The younger goddess laid a gentle hand on Demeter's arm. 'I have been happy to be home with you, mother.",
      "I was not in any grave peril, in those days away from you.'",
      "She paused and bit her lip, considering her next words. 'Mother.",
      "Dear Mother, you...you will look after the earth while I am gone, will you not?",
      "I shall come home in half a year.",
      "The mortals, dearest, they are so...so weak.'",
      "Demeter frowned. '",
      "Do you lecture me on my duty, Kore?",
      "Will you not miss me as much as I will mourn you?'",
      "She dropped the little hand and rose, agitated. 'Never mind, it was a foolish question, of course you could not- you cannot possibly understand the love of a mother.",
      "Hear me, my daughter.",
      "Until you come home I will not pour bounty on the earth- it shall be as frozen and dormant as my poor broken heart.'",
      "Persephone stood also, brushing the crumbs from her dress. 'Mother!",
      "You cannot be so cruel!",
      "People would starve, even though you know that I will be safe, that I will come back to you.",
      "Why?'",
      "Demeter whirled on her, her colour high and her eyes brimming with tears. 'Safe?",
      "With that man?",
      "The man who took your girlhood, your person and who knows what else from you?",
      "From me.'",
      "Persephone smiled wryly. 'I think that there would be few who would seek to harm that which belongs to Hades, mother.",
      "He is known for his jealousy over that which is his; and I am, after all, his wife.",
      "I don't suggest that his reasons for keeping me safe are as pure or as beautiful as yours, no one can love me as you do mother.",
      "Please, I don't wish to fight- let us enjoy these last few days.'",
      "Demeter smiled sadly and opened her arms.",
      "Persephone stepped into them and rested her cheek on her mother's shoulder.",
      "What she did not say to her mother was that, after talking with the nymphs who kept her company much of the time, she had come to understand that Hades, although she had not realised it at the time, had been gentle with her in a way that not all men were with women.",
      "She was grateful for that, and for the first time had wondered if her father had treated her mother with the violent passion that some of the nymphs seemed to think was common.",
      "It was not a subject she would ever raise, there were somethings that were best left well alone.",
      "She felt Demeter straighten her shoulders and stepped back from her.",
      "The harvest goddess held her at arms length and looked at her fondly. 'You are right of course, my love.",
      "When did you become so brave?",
      "Come now, turn about for me- I wish to see your latest new gown.'",
      "Laughingly, Persephone obliged- turning this way and that as instructed.",
      "She had thought long and hard about the matter of her dress.",
      "It had seemed wrong, somehow to dress as she had done in her innocence, but at the same time- she could not very well wander about the countryside dressed in the royal robes and jewels that Hades had provided.",
      "She invoked quite enough fear in those who encountered her as it was, Persephone had no desire to terrorize people.",
      "In the end, she had settled for a few gowns that were the colour of jewels and of a simple elegant design.",
      "They suited her she felt, and when she put them on was quite content with her choice.",
      "It was nice to decide for herself what to wear.",
      "Demeter had always supplied her clothes in her innocence and then Hades had arrayed her as a pampered queen.",
      "In these gowns, she was not clothed as either the dread Queen of the Underworld or as Springtime, but simply as herself.",
      "It was...liberating.",
      "The day came when she had to return to the world below, the sun had risen on a changed world that morning.",
      "The leaves had fallen to the ground just as surely as Demeter's tears had fallen from her bright eyes.",
      "Persephone donned a light cloak that was the colour of polished emeralds and kissed her mother sweetly.",
      "She had said a soft farewell to the nymphs who had borne her company for many hours and set off towards the dark River Acheron.",
      "She did not, could not, look back at her mother as she walked away- to do so would be to falter and she would not break her promise to Hades, that she would return willingly to his side.",
      "As she approached her destination, being just a short way off, two men fell into step with her- flanking her.",
      "One looked vaguely familiar and she stopped short to look at him, trying to puzzle out where she had seen this face before.",
      "He was clearly either a god or descended from them, no mere mortal sported such a face or figure.",
      "The man, misinterpreting her curious gaze, flashed her a charming, easy smile. 'Fair lady, your humble servants beg your favour.' 'Who are you?'",
      "She asked lightly, 'I feel I have seen you before, but your companion never.",
      "Speak then, friend.'",
      "The golden haired man grinned widely at this, like a hunter who had just caught his prey. 'You do me great honour, my lady- to even remember my face.",
      "I am Pirithous, we dined together at your presentation on Mount Olympus.",
      "This is Theseus, he bears me company on my difficult quest.'",
      "Something like foreboding tickled at the back of Persephone's neck. '",
      "What manner of quest do you undertake, honourable Pirithous?'",
      "She responded, setting off again at a quicker pace.",
      "Once more that smile.",
      "The golden haired Theseus dropped back, out of her eyeline and she turned to keep him in sight. 'Simply the finding of a wife who is worthy of me, my lady.'",
      "Persephone frowned at the arrogance, whilst turning her back on Pirithous, who circled her -like a vulture- and simultaneously trying to keep track of the quick, sly movements of his friend.",
      "One stood behind her and one in front and she was ready to cry out in alarm when a sack came over her head.",
      "She struggled.",
      "Kicking out with her legs and feeling the pain of a successful kick shooting up her ankle.",
      "A club or some blunt weapon was swung at her head and stunned her.",
      "The poor, frightened girl dropped to the ground in a heap and rough rope was wound tightly, cruelly around her wrists.",
      "She heard Pirithous' soft laughter and Theseus' deep voice urging him to hurry up and drag her away from the open country.",
      "Her head ached, her foot hurt but she opened her mouth and screamed as loudly as she could.",
      "The careless fools had not gagged her, mercifully.",
      "Theseus swore and clamped a hand over her mouth, above the hessian sacking that blocked her vision, she twisted and writhed in his grasp, breaking free and wailing once more. 'Hades!",
      "Hades!",
      "Help me, husband, please!' 'Shut her up, will you?",
      "If we get caught, we are doomed.",
      "For goodness sakes, Pirithous!",
      "Why didn't we knock her out first?'",
      "She was suddenly thrust forward, throwing her off balance and once more a club was swung at her head.",
      "The blow struck true and pain exploded in her head.",
      "Persephone concentrated on taking deep breaths, trying desperately to remain conscious.",
      "Falling to the ground once more, she vaguely heard a shout of alarm- she could not guess from whom- and the frantic flapping of wings.",
      "Persephone, dizzied and sick with fright, felt claws dig into her shoulders and was all of a sudden lifted high.",
      "In her confusion, she doubted her senses, was she being carried through the air or had that second blow knocked all sense and reason from her head?",
      "She could see nothing through the sack and the air she breathed tasted acrid and foul.",
      "She fought still, for consciousness- hoping that if she could only remain awake, perhaps there might be some hope of escape for her.",
      "She was once more dropped, a short while later, after being swung about dreadfully.",
      "She heard muffled voices speaking, but could not make out the words or even who might be talking.",
      "If only she did not faint!",
      "Her face felt hot and wet and she knew that the liquid that ran into her eyes was her own blood.",
      "A mortal would certainly have perished by now.",
      "The sack was lifted off her and the Queen closed her eyes against the blood that was flowing, too freely, into them.",
      "She snapped them open again when she heard the resounding bellow of rage from who ever had freed her from it.",
      "Hades.",
      "The waters of the River Styx lapped against the shore that she had been dropped on.",
      "Her husband stood; dark robed and furious, with the rough sack still in his hand.",
      "Hades seemed bigger, darker somehow- she was reminded of the images behind his throne, depicting him as a fearsome warrior.",
      "Two of the Furies still had their talons in the shoulders of her would be abductors, Tisiphone, who had carried her, crouched nearby- awaiting Hades' command. 'Take them to Tartarus- keep them alive.'",
      "he spat out the words, all somber regality forgotten.",
      "The god who ruled over the dead was in the grips of a beastly anger, such had never before been seen.",
      "He was snarling, like a feral animal at the fools who had tried to take his queen as they were borne aloft by gleeful Erinyes.",
      "Hades reached down and lifted her up, his chariot stood by and she remembered the last time she had been carefully taken up this hill, after an abduction.",
      "Persephone clung to Hades this time, had she not done so, she was sure that she would faint or vomit.",
      "He was stone like in his solidity, a safe anchor to depend on for strength- she thought as she slipped her arms about his waist without even a hesitation.",
      "She tried to wipe the blood out of her eyes with her cloak, which was probably now ruined, she thought irrelevantly, but gave up.",
      "What she needed was a large basin of hot water and a soft cloth.",
      "Then bed.",
      "She was unused to feeling tired, goddess as she was, and she knew that her injuries were grievous by the fatigue that spread through her.",
      "Gods were almost impossible to kill, but if seriously injured relied heavily on the healing power of sleep to make them well again.",
      "Persephone closed her eyes against Hades' strong shoulder and remained thus until he set her down on his bed.",
      "He stared at her, seemingly devoid of words his chest heaving with the effort of self control.",
      "A servant entered, bearing a bowl of steaming water, sweetly scented with fragrant oils.",
      "Hades waved the girl away and himself set to work dipping a piece of creamy silk into the water.",
      "Persephone lay still and docile as her husband tenderly washed her face and bound up her wounds.",
      "He seemed to recollect himself, the closer he got to completing his task and by the time soft bandages had been wrapped carefully around her gashed wrists, his breathing had calmed and his teeth no longer bared ready for murder.",
      "She broke the silence first. 'Thank you.'",
      "she rasped, her throat was raw.",
      "He rose and crossed the room, reaching for a goblet of wine which he brought to her lips and helped her drink. 'I'm sorry,' she said lowly, when her throat was soothed, 'that you were put to the trouble of fetching me, after all.'",
      "Ok, *deep breath*.",
      "This chapter was hideously, horribly, awful to get written.",
      "So if you could squint over any errors in it, i'd be very grateful!",
      "Thank you for your kind comments last chapter, its so AMAZING to hear from those of you who are reading, I can't even tell you how happy comments make me.",
      "If you are expecting Pirithous and Theseus to get dealt with this chapter, I'm afraid you will be disappointed, that's for chapter 10.",
      "Hades had to realise something quite important first.",
      "I was as surprised as you.",
      "Oh, and I'm sorry for how erratic my posting is.",
      "If you don't know already, there is a little 'subscribe' button at the top of the page that will send you an email when I update- it also lets me keep track of how many of you are actually reading!:)",
      "He looked at her, seemingly dumbfounded for several long moments, and Persephone inwardly squirmed, feeling that her feeble attempt at a jest had gone sadly awry.",
      "She closed her eyes in an attempt to lessen her embarrassment.",
      "Hades sat down beside her on the great bed and drew a soft blanket over her. 'Sleep, little wife.",
      "Your injuries are severe.'",
      "His voice, that low pleasing caress to her senses, was close to the shell of her ear and she opened her eyes to see him lean over her and gently kiss her bloodied forehead.",
      "Curiosity, which was not a vice she usually struggled to contain, made her grasp at his hand and voice her questions. 'Husband, please.",
      "I'll not rest well until I know what those men wanted with me!",
      "I have met Pirithous once, Lord Hades, and I have no notion of why he sought to harm me.'",
      "Hades eyes grew darker and the tender expression in them was replaced by a steely thirst for blood to be spilled.",
      "His hand, still entwined with hers was to his lips and he rained kisses on her trembling fingers.",
      "Doubtless they would show bruising very soon. 'I will find out, my dear.",
      "I had them sent to Tartarus, I hope the Erinyes don't send them mad with anguish- I intend to question them once you are well again.",
      "A day or two there will loosen their tongues, they will beg to confess once the Furies get started.''",
      "The sheer ferocity in his voice when he spoke of Pirithous and Theseus sent a shiver through the battered girl on the bed.",
      "Hades noticed it and drew off his cloak to cover his wife. 'Thank you,' she whispered, for the second time that day. 'Thank you for hearing me.",
      "Thank you for sending help.",
      "I don't...' tears leaked from her eyes, she barely registered them, 'I cannot even think of what might have happened had you not done so.'",
      "Her gratitude and fear must have been clearly shown on her face, for Hades hauled her to him and his arms fastened about her like a vice.",
      "He breathed into her hair. 'I will always come when you bid me near you, Persephone.",
      "I sent the furies because they are faster than I, both in the Underworld and above.",
      "I have fought in a war so terrible that it would make your precious blood run cold, and then I went into battle unafraid.",
      "When I felt you calling for me, the terror in your voice, my darling...I hope never to feel so powerless again.'",
      "Persephone was silent, she pitied him, in the same way she had pitied her mother when he had taken her.",
      "It was plain to her, in this moment, wrapped as he was around her that he did not value her as a mere possession- there was clearly more than that in his heart.",
      "Whatever strength of affection he had for her, hers could not match it...and she pitied him for that too.",
      "Persephone felt no shame in the peace that enveloped her, as she rested in his strong arms, though.",
      "In his bed, with this fearsome god protecting her- from even the cold, she did not feel so afraid.",
      "Her ordeal was over, for now.",
      "She would sleep and recover, and in the morning she would muster up the courage to deal out dire punishment to the fools who would attack a Queen.",
      "It was bloodthirsty thought, unusually for her, but she drifted off gently to sleep regardless- with a slight smile turning up her lips.",
      "*",
      "*********** When she awoke, Hades was still beside her.",
      "She looked inquiringly up at him when he noticed that she was conscious and he looked rather pleased as he passed her a cup of cool, fresh water. 'I would have left you to slumber in peace, my Lady; but alas, you were utterly unwilling to permit it.' 'Oh!'",
      "his wife blushed, realising that at some point during her rest, she had wound herself around her husband tighter than ivy on a solid branch.",
      "She disentangled herself, feeling quite self conscious when his dark eyes did not leave her.",
      "Persephone did not think she was vain, but clambering off the bed and heading straight towards a mirror gave her a moment to compose herself.",
      "She supposed she ought to see the extent of the damage, after all.",
      "The most severe of her injuries had healed, there was no blood left on her face and the wounds had knit themselves into tight, brown scars.",
      "Her forehead looked the worst, she supposed, a mottled purple with green at the edges.",
      "Persephone grimaced. 'I think I shall wait until I am fully healed before I confront my attackers.",
      "They need to know they are dealing with a goddess after all.'",
      "She said it mildly, but allowed the slightest edge of firmness to creep into her words.",
      "Hades was looking amused, so she raised her chin for good measure.",
      "Her husband leaned back against his pillows, she could see the indentation where she had just lain and felt heat rise up her neck once more as she watched his elegant hands smooth the creases out of the cover idly. '",
      "And what makes you think I will permit such a thing, my dear?' 'Hades!",
      "I must!",
      "I deserve to have my vengeance!' 'You shall have it, little wife- I shall dole it out for you.",
      "You need not subject yourself to such unpleasantness.'",
      "Persephone felt her temper rise. 'Husband!",
      "You cannot mean it!",
      "Please, I entreat you.'",
      "Something gleamed in his eyes that she could not name. '",
      "How the innocent maiden has been corrupted!'",
      "he sighed, amusement still playing about his lips 'Sweet Persephone; who used to turn away from the tears of the condemned shades now bargaining for a part in my judgement.'",
      "Hades rose gracefully from his bed and stood, holding out his hand in invitation.",
      "She padded over to him and took it. 'I suspect,' he continued, slowly, 'that one of those men has looked on my wife with lust in his eyes and if he does it again in front of me...' 'What?' she prompted, curious once again. 'I am likely lose my temper and kill him too soon, my dear.",
      "Once he is dead, I can consign him to eternal suffering-",
      "but I want his death drawn out,' Hades voice softened to a dangerous hiss. 'I want him to beg for his life whilst teetering endlessly on that agonizing brink that lies between living and dying.",
      "They will regret their foolishness.'",
      "Persephone couldn't account for it, really she couldn't, but she reached up and pressed her lips to his.",
      "The response was instantaneous, Hades kissed her ruthlessly in return and had just brought his hands up to drag the sleeves of her dress from her shoulders when a knock sounded at the door.",
      "Blocking her from sight of the door with his body, Hades granted permission to enter.",
      "His eyes never left hers. 'Well?'",
      "he said coldly, to the male servant who hovered by the door.",
      "'News has just reached us, great King.",
      "Lord Hephaestus requests entrance to your realm.'",
      "Persephone, standing so close to him, saw Hades' eyebrows raise in disdain. 'Bid him come, then.'",
      "he was all he said. '",
      "He mentioned her majesty, sire.'",
      "The messenger spoke again, carefully.",
      "Hades, his face suddenly turned unreadable, turned around to face the man. '",
      "In what manner?' he enquired. 'Lord Hephaestus wishes to present her with a gift, my King.'",
      "Hades paused and then with deliberate exaggeration, waved the man away.'Very well.",
      "Be gone.'",
      "Bowing low, the messenger fled.",
      "Persephone smiled slightly at the quick exit of Hades' servant, amused at her husband's lack of concern that he terrified nearly all he encountered.",
      "She understood, a little now, that to be so feared was to live a lonely life.",
      "It was an isolation she had encountered upon returning above the earth as his queen.",
      "He stooped and swiftly kissed her. 'You need not come, if you do not feel well enough- my dear.'",
      "he said. 'I can...dispense with the blacksmith.'",
      "She did not feel well, in truth, but neither would she lay abed whilst the King of the Underworld terrorized the gentle, lame Hephaestus; who had braved the realms of death in order to bring her a present.",
      "Besides, she was curious.",
      "She took his arm and lightly guided him to the door, he moved easily to her slight pressure.",
      "Hades attentively shortened his stride to match hers, as they made their way through the bright hallways of the palace towards the throne room.",
      "The consideration was one she was grateful for, she was still achingly sore.",
      "Hephaestus, the god of craftsmanship, stood before the dias and turned, bowing low as they entered.",
      "In his hand he held a rough, hessian sack and Persephone stiffened at the sight of it.",
      "Bravely lifting her chin, she mounted the shallow steps with Hades' assistance and sat, gratefully on her throne. 'Speak then, son of Hera.",
      "What brings you to our realm?'",
      "Hades was not precisely rude to Hephaestus, but there was something...sinister, in his manner of speech that caused Persephone's eyebrows to twitch together. 'I bring gifts, for your Lady queen- in honor of your illustrious marriage- majesty.'",
      "Raising his eyes at last to her face, Persephone saw the shocked disbelief flash across Hephaestus' face.",
      "The conclusion he drew was clear, his eyes immediately flicked to Hades and his next words were nigh on spat out. 'I have heard of the decree of the fates...this device will mark the passing of time, without need of the sun.",
      "It will give you, o queen, a reliable indication of when your time to leave here approaches.'",
      "He withdrew his hand from the sack, holding a dark orb with lights shining like the stars from within it.",
      "He approached the steps cautiously, his eyes taking in her poor abused face,expression furious and held out the device to her.",
      "She was about to reach forward and take it when Hades stood abruptly and intercepted it and passing the gift to his wife, who took it with a quizzical lift of her brow.",
      "Persephone touched the orb carefully, from within a mechanical clicking could be heard, a little like the chirp of crickets that she had so often heard as a girl.",
      "Smiling, she raised it to her ear to listen more carefully.",
      "Hades stood by, glaring at Hephaestus, who stood his ground. 'Tell me, coppersmith, how can this tell me such things as you claim?'",
      "she asked softly, intrigued.",
      "Hephaestus stood a little taller under her notice.",
      "Hades returned to his throne. 'It is a matter of being able to read it, my lady.'",
      "he said, grinning with enthusiasm for his art.. '",
      "The largest of the lights represents the sun above and the red glow depicts the main light of this kingdom.",
      "As time progresses, they each move away from each other within the globe and when they cross- that is your time to depart or return.'",
      "Persephone beamed at him and reached out her hand for him to kiss. 'I thank you then, friend.",
      "Your skilled craftsmanship is famed for good reason.",
      "I daresay I shall keep it beside my bed, always.'",
      "Hephaestus limped forward to bestow a light, courteous kiss on the tips of the queen's fingers releasing them gently when he heard an ominous low rumble from her husband.",
      "Persephone's cheeks spread with warm colour as she thought guiltily of Hades' words to her before they were wed. That he would guard what was his, that he would indeed be a jealous husband.",
      "Had she flaunted him, just now- even unintentionally?",
      "Where was the cautious, ever respectful attitude that she had so carefully preserved in his presence?",
      "Had it melted away with a few passionate kisses?",
      "Perhaps the excitement of her return had addled her wits.",
      "She leant across the arm of her chair and laid a hand on Hades forearm.",
      "The muscles beneath her hand were taut and as hard as the glittering diamonds that were embedded in his throne.",
      "Hephaestus spoke. '",
      "Perhaps I might beg a word in private, my lady?'",
      "Persephone opened her mouth to deny him but was forestalled by the haughty Hades. 'You might beg all you please, lame one but any words you for my wife must and shall be uttered before me.",
      "Hephaestus was not a coward.",
      "It was true that physically speaking, he was weaker and more repellent than the others of his race but he was a god, nonetheless.",
      "He would not, could not allow such blatant disdain pass unnoted, not even from the august king whose halls he now stood within. 'I believe I addressed my lady.'",
      "he drawled.",
      "His arm, strengthened by long hours hammering at his forge, flexed.",
      "Not quite a threat, not precisely a challenge.",
      "The slight movement was noted however, and Hades casually, insultingly, swung his sceptre to and fro.",
      "The subtle message was clear. 'Not so,' responded Hades quietly, 'you addressed my lady.",
      "Have a care with your words, lame one, should you be any more familiar with the Queen of the Underworld, you may find yourself robbed of them.' 'Is that a threat?' Hades laughed.",
      "The room rang with it, softly derisive and so very assured. 'I am not famed for idle threats, son of Hera.",
      "Speak then, and leave.",
      "You grow tiresome and my lady grows weary.'",
      "Persephone, who had remained silent and watchful in the face of their barely restrained aggression, soothingly stroked the arm that remained hard under her hand. 'Indeed, kind Lord Hephaestus, do speak- if you bear a message from my mother, there is no reason why my husband should not hear it.'",
      "Hades' arm relaxed, ever so slightly at her words and soft ministrations.",
      "Hephaestus looked confused. 'I bear no such greeting, o queen.",
      "I wished to offer...protection...in the face of your injuries.",
      "Should you be in need of refuge- I am at your command.'",
      "Hades leapt from his throne, his face full of thunder. 'Fool!",
      "You would steal my wife from me!",
      "You would dare...' Persephone stood also, reaching out for him. 'Husband, please!",
      "I am sure that no such suggestion was intended.",
      "Lord Hephaestus may have...I believe he may have reached the wrong conclusion regarding my injuries.'",
      "She stepped close to Hades, her instinct guiding her to offer reassurance to soothe and calm the towering rage she could see building in him.",
      "She turned to Hephaestus. 'Sir, I thank you for your kindness but...his majesty is not responsible for this.'",
      "With her free hand, she indicated her face. '",
      "On my return to the Underworld, I was set upon by a pair of vicious mortals, my Lord Husband saved me, sir.",
      "It is his protection that I shall rely upon.'",
      "Hephaestus gaped at her, his rugged face alight with astonishment. 'I beg your majesty's' pardon, then,' he said graciously, at length.",
      "He paused, awkwardly shifting his weight from his lame leg, 'but...mortals you say?",
      "It is unheard of.",
      "I cannot understand it.'",
      "Hades wrapped his arms about Persephone and drew her close to him. 'You are not required to understand it, Hephaestus.",
      "It is I who must understand it, my wife shall be avenged.",
      "One of them at least is a demigod, he sought to abduct her, to make her his.",
      "Such a crime cannot go unpunished.",
      "I will see to it.'",
      "Here Hades lifted a hand to rhythmically stroke the hair of the woman in his arms, heedless of Hephaestus' fascinated gaze.",
      "Persephone, embarrassed by such open affection turned her face to Hades' shoulder.",
      "She was so tired.",
      "Hephaestus could not tear his eyes away from the royal pair in front of him, Hades looked back, knowingly.",
      "The great and powerful god of the kingdom of death knew well the envy that was in his heart.",
      "What male could meet with such a woman and not be affected by her?",
      "Hades knew, and would keep what was his.",
      "The blushing goddess had absolutely no idea how very appealing she was.",
      "He could not win this battle, but perhaps he could leave with some dignity if he could at least crack Hades' blasted superiority.",
      "Hephaestus inclined his head, readying himself for the retreat. 'I am quite sure that the Lady will be well protected from now on, then.",
      "I wonder, your Majesty, if your punishment to those who assaulted her will be more grievous because their crime against her, echoes your own, so very...closely.'",
      "Persephone stiffened against Hades and turned, wide eyed to look on Hephaestus.",
      "What could possibly have prompted him to make such an audacious remark?",
      "He looked unrepentant, triumphant even.",
      "She turned her head to Hades, expecting to see him preparing for a murder.",
      "Instead, he was staring blank faced at the blacksmith, a tumult of emotion stormed in his dark eyes.",
      "He did not move, not towards Hephaestus, nor away from her.",
      "He stood stock still, save for the suddenly rapid moving of his chest.",
      "The hand that had been stroking Persephone's dark curls clenched into a fist in her hair.",
      "Hades swallowed. 'Very well, lame one.",
      "Your point is well made.'",
      "he sounded thunderstruck.",
      "The King of the Underworld looked down at the gentle, sweet goddess by his side.",
      "A whole world of feeling was in his eyes but his voice was flat as he addressed the cunning craftsman one last time. 'Now get...out.'",
      "So.",
      "Yes.",
      "I actually quite like this chapter, not sure its up everyone's street- but aside from the first chapters, its been one of the easier ones to write.",
      "You know, bit of vicious judgement being doled out...why on earth wouldn't the words flow on to the page?",
      "Here is your warning.",
      "This may be unpleasant to some of you, there is blood and nastiness ahead.",
      "Skip it if you don't care for that sort of thing.",
      "I'm a little overwhelmed by how lovely you all are, I have been having such kind comments left for me to enjoy and it looks like this chapter will push us over a thousand hits.",
      "yikes!",
      "When I started this, I was aware that not many people flock to this fandom, but I was completely willing to write it anyway because I couldn't resist.",
      "I figured that if one person read it and enjoyed it then it would be utterly worth it.",
      "Thank you for your support.",
      "Persephone stood, in the circle of her husbands' arms long after Hephaestus had left.",
      "She remained silent, unsure what to say that might ease the awkwardness that had settled over them.",
      "Hades had stooped to bury his face in her hair and she felt him trembling.",
      "He said nothing, making no sound, but neither did he release her.",
      "Persephone, kind hearted as she was, wished that the blacksmith god had retreated sooner.",
      "It was true that Hades had abducted her just as it was unavoidably certain that Pirithous and Theseus had sought to do the same.",
      "Nevertheless, what good did it do to raise such a subject?",
      "She had eaten the food of the dead, she was irrevocably under the rule of King Hades- even as she ruled over his subjects.",
      "She could admit to herself that she did not like to see this proud, mighty man so distressed.",
      "Eventually, when her head spun and only his arms kept her standing; Hades raised his head.",
      "He avoided her gaze, but not even his carefully blank expression could hide the glaze of tears that he did not allow to fall.",
      "He took a step back, bowing to her and she closed her eyes against a wave of nausea that rose up in her throat. 'Come.",
      "You should rest.",
      "If you insist upon your revenge against Pirithous and the half-wit King of Athens, you will need to at least be able to stand under your own power.",
      "Rest until the center of the earth is cloaked with red, then we shall go to Tartarus.'",
      "He half carried her back to her room, Persephone made no objection.",
      "The gift from Hephaestus was placed gently on a polished table.",
      "Her husband drew the cover up over her shoulders and bent to whisper a kiss to her mouth.",
      "She was asleep in moments, but found her mind plagued by strange dreams in which Hades and Demeter circled the globe around her, never crossing and always so very far apart.",
      "She heard the voices of strange men in her nightmares and fancied that she heard their howls of agony all the way from Tartarus.",
      "*",
      "********** She was woken, when rosy light bounced obnoxiously through her window, by the usual procession of maids to assist her in dressing.",
      "She was glad of the ornate robes and jewels they so carefully arrayed her in.",
      "Such finery provided her with a feminine sort of armour against her nerves.",
      "They powdered her face, tinted her lips and dressed her dark curls with oil before pinning on her diadem.",
      "When Persephone looked at herself in the mirror she drew herself up with pride at the sight that met her eyes.",
      "With her chin up and dressed in her splendour, she looked every bit as powerful as Hades' consort ought to look.",
      "It was only when she stepped closer to her reflection, after waving the silent women away, that she saw that old timidity lurking within..",
      "She would conquer her fear of displeasing, if only for today.",
      "Today was a chance to set her name firmly into the legends and tales of the mortals.",
      "Whatever she had told Orpheus, she had no desire to be forever painted by men as a helpless victim of circumstance.",
      "Something inside her, something unequivocally her, told her that she was worthy of something more than that, she simply had to take it.",
      "The king met her at the door of her chambers, surprising her again by bowing in response to her slight obeisance.",
      "His eyes warmed as they rested on her black gown. '",
      "That is....a very striking effect, my Queen.",
      "It was well thought of.'",
      "Hades himself looked no less intimidating.",
      "He wore his shining armour of gold and atop his head perched his famed helm of invisibility, crafted by Hephaestus himself in the fires of Mount Etna.",
      "He saw her looking at it curiously and remarked gravely, 'It seems that for all his shortcomings, the lame craftsman provides much that is useful.'",
      "He offered his arm and they went out together to his chariot.",
      "Persephone still disliked the stamping, furious beasts and neither was she pleased by their extreme pace or lurching gait.",
      "She could accept though, this time, that having Hades' arms either side of her was certainly reassuring.",
      "He would never let her fall.",
      "They rode, quickly, to the furthest edges of the Underworld, far away from her favoured willow grove and beyond sight of the Elysian Fields where the shades all grovelled on the ground as their chariot sped past.",
      "The landscape, never especially verdant in the Underworld, became desolate and bleak.",
      "Nothing grew, nothing stirred.",
      "The ground began to slope downwards and as they descended, the air became sparse and tasted of rotting flesh.",
      "The light grew dimmer and dimmer, until the blackness closed in around the chariot and its occupants.",
      "Hades did not seem perturbed, neither did he seem confounded by the lack of light.",
      "He guided his horses unerringly through the inky nothingness until the faintest glimmering glow appeared in the distance and a dark walled city could just be made out ahead.",
      "She heard the screams, even before they came within sight of the gates of Tartarus.",
      "The horses, held securely by her husband, laid back their ears and whinnied in response to the blood curdling howls of the condemned.",
      "Persephone stiffened.",
      "Part of her, the part that came from the sheltered home with her mother, did not wish to enter this place.",
      "The place for the condemned, which even the gods did not mention casually.",
      "She would not quail.",
      "She would not plead and beg with her husband to spare her this grim task for which she had entreated him.",
      "He would remain with her, she knew this much and took comfort from it.",
      "The great gates that securely guarded all manner of horrors opened wide at a gesture from their master.",
      "Cerberus, the dark, three headed hound of hell, gnashed its teeth and breathed foul breath upon them as they passed between its massive paws.",
      "Persephone's crown weighed heavily on her head but she did not allow her head to sink beneath its pressing authority.",
      "When Hades held the horses still, he assisted her down and squeezed her hand in reassurance. 'It is not far, the Erinyes would not have taken them to the depths, they will be nearby.'",
      "He looked grim, this was not a place which anyone would willingly come to, yet Hades sojourned to Tartarus whensoever his duty demanded it of him.",
      "She could admire that bravery.",
      "One of the furies flew overhead of them as they moved away from the chariot.",
      "The darkness here seemed to be something tangible, it was as though an immense city was fashioned from thick, black shadows, shadows that could only be made out by the harsh, uncompromising light that seemed to stem from nowhere at all.",
      "Hades scowled at the winged creature. 'Tisiphone, greet your Queen.'",
      "He spoke with more volume and assertiveness than was his wont and Persephone had a blinding flash of insight as to why.",
      "The further from the sky that Hades went, the more his power and authority was tested.",
      "In her father Zeus' palace he had barely raised his voice above a murmur...but she had instinctively appreciated his might hadn't she?",
      "Here, in Tartarus he was surrounded by those who challenged him, souls and creatures whom he held here against their wills.",
      "This was why Hades ruled this place.",
      "Was he, in fact, the only one of the three brothers who was able?",
      "Persephone looked at her husband, with this new insight and for a moment understood him better than she ever had.",
      "There was much food for thought, once this duty was done, she would retreat to her willow grove and ponder all that she had learnt of him.",
      "Tisiphone hurtled towards the ground (earth, it could not be called- not even Demeter could draw life from the miry tar of despair that served as a floor here) and prostrated herself before Queen Persephone.",
      "The Queen saw that the large, leathery wings were scaled with the still blooded fingernails of the fury's victims, and quickly bade her lead on to the prisoners.",
      "Tisiphone shrieked a cry of death and sped off.",
      "The royal pair made their way to the cell in which the prisoners were kept, bound in wicked chains.",
      "The light, Persephone noted, was not like the light from the great sun in Zeus' sky, nor like the fiery ball that served the Underworld.",
      "It was a light that was beyond description in colour and intensity- she herself found it uncomfortable, Hades merely squinted his eyes against it- yet the captives before them seemed to be struck with the wildest agonies by it.",
      "Theseus cried out, true desperation caused his voice to crack and waver.",
      "There was little resemblance now between the prowling King of Athens who had thrown a sack over her head and the broken, bleeding man on his knees. 'O Queen!",
      "Have mercy!",
      "Please.",
      "I beg of you.",
      "Mercy for foolish Theseus.'",
      "He crawled towards her and reached out a hand to touch the sole of her foot.",
      "Hades stepped forward and swung down his heavy broadsword, cutting off the tips of the man's fingers. 'You have not learned your lesson then?' he hissed,'That she is not to be touched?",
      "You are not worthy to look on her.",
      "If you do so again, I will command the furies to gouge out your eyeballs and roll them into the Styx.'",
      "Theseus whimpered. 'Your pardon, great King.'",
      "He tried to turn his face away from the light and the goddess he had wronged. '",
      "What can I do?",
      "What must I promise?",
      "If anything can be done, I will do it.",
      "Have pity on me!'",
      "He whined and writhed on the floor as Alecto clawed, playfully, at his gushing fingers.",
      "Persephone leaned into her husband, grateful for his strength. '",
      "Why does the light hurt them so?'",
      "She asked.",
      "She found that there was a kind of strange pleasure to be had, in hearing the wretched man beg so humbly.",
      "Hades, one hand still holding his sword, did not take his dispassionate gaze from the pair of men that grovelled before him. '",
      "The light is truth.",
      "There is nothing so painful as being made to see everything, even oneself by its glow.",
      "Even we gods are not immune to its power.",
      "The condemned must face eternity unable to lie to themselves that they do not deserve their punishments.'",
      "The truth.",
      "Perhaps that explained why she was so desperately clinging to Hades, whom she had professed to hate not so long ago. 'I see.'",
      "Was all she said.",
      "It certainly explained a good deal about her husband.",
      "He was, unflinchingly,cruelly, honest, she supposed.",
      "He did not tell her pretty lies in order to placate her, he stated fact and reason and did so unapologetically.",
      "A god who so often had business in Tartarus would need such brutal veracity.",
      "It was even more of an explanation as to why he did not rule the sky nor the oceans- but instead took charge of this place of terror that both gods and mortals feared so.",
      "Persephone, feeling her own power acutely, gestured to the waiting Fury to raise Pirithous up from the floor.",
      "She looked at his blood covered face, unsympathetic and utterly unafraid.",
      "He could not meet her eyes.",
      "Vindication was not a comfortable feeling, nor was it a relief. '",
      "You laid hands on me, Pirithous.",
      "I want to know why.",
      "You spoke of a worthy wife.",
      "Speak now of your unworthy ambitions.'",
      "Her tone was softly laced with derision and the quivering wreck before her flinched at her question. '",
      "It was all a wager.",
      "Just a stupid, foolish bet.",
      "We were drunk, we spoke of finding wives who would show our fellow men that we were far better than they.",
      "Theseus...together we took Helen of Sparta, she is young and fated to be the loveliest of all mortal women.",
      "I wanted a daughter of Zeus...so I chose you.",
      "I was struck by your sweetness at your presentation...how very...innocent you were, I wanted to....' The Queen held up her palm to halt his speech and he choked on the words he tried to force out.",
      "Hades pounced.",
      "He shot forward and grasping the Pirithous' blood slicked hair in his hand, forced his neck back to breaking point.",
      "The man could not even gurgle his own blood, such was his agony. 'I could break your scrawny neck with one hand, o worthless Pirithous.",
      "I could end your life right now and spend eternity taking my revenge on you for your hubris.",
      "No god would speak for you, not one.",
      "Not even your exalted father.'",
      "Hades drew back and spat in Pirithous' face. 'I shan't yet, though.'",
      "Hades smiled, a savage terrible smile. 'Your manner of death shall be decided by her.",
      "The Queen of the Underworld will choose in what manner your rotten thread of life will be snipped... and then,' he paused with evident satisfaction, 'you will face my judgement.",
      "You like bets, lapith?",
      "I will stake a wager with my wife that you will curse the mother that bore you by the time you cross the Styx, rather than face my wrath.",
      "What say you, my Queen?'",
      "Persephone lowered her lashes. 'I will take your wager, my Lord.",
      "I think he will rue that he was born long before then.'",
      "Something dark and amorous sparkled in Hades gaze as he smiled on his wife. 'Speak your judgement on these men then, Lady wife.'",
      "Hades smiled.",
      "Persephone raised her hands, she had thought much of this. '",
      "They must be taken to great Poseidon's shore.",
      "Their bodies will harden and grow as dark as their hearts.",
      "They will become granite, able to feel and to think but unable to draw that next breath or to cry out their pain.",
      "The wind and the rain will bite into their bodies.",
      "Year by year the elements will eat at them until they perish into dust.",
      "A slow death, my Lord Hades...and an even slower afterlife.'",
      "Hades threw Pirithous to the floor. '",
      "So be it.",
      "It shall be done.'",
      "Hades stood over the pair and watched as the curse crept from their feet, up twitching legs and into their torsos.",
      "It took but a moment before their faces were hardened into dark rock, their mouths still open as their last screams were frozen before they could end.",
      "The furies flapped around the room, leaping a merry, macabre dance, before their claws scraped and dug into the stone arms of the condemned kings and lifted them up, carrying them off.",
      "The weepings and wailings of the other inmates of Tartarus seemed quieter now to Persephone, once that sombre judgement was passed.",
      "Hades wiped the blade of his sword and sheathed it. 'I should like to go.'",
      "she said. 'Thank you for letting me come.",
      "I do not like it here, but...it was necessary.'",
      "He led her out of Tartarus, with its harsh revealing light, and handed her back up to the chariot.",
      "She felt his breath on her neck as he steered the horses in the darkness, toward home.",
      "It did not trouble her, this intimacy.",
      "Tartarus had forced her to see him as he was, but so too did it make her see herself; and more importantly, what she could be.",
      "She could be a Queen, a wife and a daughter and still be quintessentially herself.",
      "He would be a King and a husband, his role- his fearful destiny- did not define him, just as hers did not dictate her own character.",
      "Her character was whatever she chose to make of it.",
      "Persephone turned her lips to Hades throat and felt him swallow convulsively.",
      "She would unravel him, this mysterious husband of hers.",
      "She would discover every facet of his being and she would come to glory in being the only one in existence, who could.",
      "All mistakes are mine, this is completely un-beta'd, sorry!",
      "If I named these chapters, this one would be called 'The quality of mercy.'",
      "I do like a bit of Shakespeare!",
      "(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)",
      "He did not take her directly back to the palace, instead, he guided the horses through the blissful fields of paradise towards Persephone's willow grove.",
      "His hands rested lightly on her waist as he lifted her down from the chariot and remained there as he looked down at her.",
      "She sagged against him. '",
      "How did you come to rule the Underworld, husband?",
      "Did you draw straws with your brothers, as the mortals say, and come here by chance?",
      "Tell me.",
      "I...Tartarus it...' Hades smiled slightly at her, his face close to hers. 'You need not explain, Persephone.",
      "I remember well the first time I went there.",
      "It took me the rest of the day to recover.",
      "Once the Titans had been suppressed and chained in the deepest part of Tartarus, the world was left in chaos- there were no boundaries, neither between the sky and the ocean nor between life and death.",
      "The Fates told us to go together to Tartarus, so that the light of truth could show us who was best suited to rule.'",
      "Hades drew breath, and gently stroked his hands up the sides of her waist, and brought them to rest behind her shoulders.",
      "A slight tug and Persephone stumbled against him, strong arms closed around her like a vice and Hades spoke softly into her hair, continuing his tale. '",
      "There is no hiding from the truth, you know.",
      "Zeus and Poseidon could not stand to be there for long.",
      "I did not find quite it so dreadful as they.",
      "The truth is a comfort to me, it is one of the few absolutes we have as immortals- so much else changes.",
      "It is only this last visit, with you, that it caused me pain.",
      "Your endurance is commendable, by the way.",
      "I was... proud of you today.",
      "You are a true Queen, I saw that regality the very first time I laid eyes on you.'",
      "He took her hand and led her through the wood, to the very first tree she had made spring up from the barren earth.",
      "It seemed so very long ago, as though the child who had watered that delicate sapling with her bitter tears; had little to do with the cold woman who had issued a death sentence earlier.",
      "It did not discomfort her, although she was sure that her mother would be horrified by the changes in her daughter (and likely blame Hades' influence!).",
      "She laid a gentle, loving hand on the bark of the drooping tree and glanced up to its canopy.",
      "She stilled.",
      "One of the branches gleamed silvery and dead in the gloam of the wood.",
      "Hades saw her looking and dropped her little hand. '",
      "Ah yes.",
      "That.",
      "I am afraid that was my doing, my dear.",
      "When I took you to Mount Olympus and saw you leave with your mother, leaving me, I came here, intent on destroying all of it.",
      "I fear that, like my brethren, I mislike having my will crossed and my wishes disregarded- even by the Fates.",
      "I only got as far as killing that one branch before thinking better of it.",
      "Forgive me.",
      "I know this place is your refuge.'",
      "Persephone reached up a smooth skinned arm and touched the bough, it was solid silver. 'Did you seek to punish me, husband?",
      "By turning my sanctuary into a forest of cold, unliving statues?",
      "It is an odd reprimand to chose, surely.'",
      "She spoke quietly, gently, knowing that anger was surely an unwise response.",
      "She knew already that Hades yielded more to her when soothed rather than when challenged.",
      "He seemed unlike himself at this moment, standing so close to her and overtaken with self-reproach.",
      "The cold, icy authority that he wielded, so naturally, seemed dormant.",
      "The goddess took his hand, quietly enjoying his look of surprise. 'Tell me, husband.",
      "What altered your course?",
      "Why cease in destroying this place, once you had begun?' Hades' finger ghosted against her cheek and pensively dipped into the small furrow that creased her brow. '",
      "This tree is the very one against which I stole your will from you.",
      "Do you remember?",
      "I...I have few regrets, my dear, those who have such qualms do not do well in Tartarus, after all- but I sorely regret taking your will from you that day.",
      "The memory of it stayed my hand.",
      "It occurred to me that you had more reason to wish punishment on me than I you.'",
      "Oh.",
      "She had been carefully watching his face.",
      "The sincerity of remorse animated his features.",
      "Persephone glanced back up to the silver bough, it was certainly very pretty- it would remain so forever, unchanging and constant, unlike the trees that would wilt and perish.",
      "It was rather fitting.",
      "She could not lie to him, not after having faced the deceit she had been practicing on herself, not after Tartarus. 'I remember.'",
      "Her voice trembled. 'You said that you wanted something that I had not given you, all I could think was that you had taken everything...until I could not think at all.'",
      "He heaved a sigh. 'Forgive me.",
      "I am sorry.'",
      "She did not relish this power she had over him, not in the same way she had fairly bloomed with satisfaction in her power over Pirithous and Theseus.",
      "She pitied him.",
      "Persephone brought tender fingertips up to his solemn countenance. 'I think you mistake me, Hades.",
      "You awoke something in me that day that I cannot regret.",
      "You were right, in a way, I was cold to you- it was all I knew until I kissed you then.",
      "When you took me back to mother, my mind was still in this grove, against this tree trying to resist begging you to make me feel that alive again.'",
      "Surprise now replaced the remorse on his face and something else crept into his eyes, something Persephone knew to be hope. '",
      "It was not until later, this very day- in fact, that I admitted this to myself.",
      "What you did, in tricking me- making me eat that pomegranate...that was wrong, but I do not regret that moment in this wood.'",
      "His eyes had closed against the caress of her fingers upon his cheek, but he opened them when she finished speaking. 'I will beg your pardon for that instead, then, my Queen.",
      "That piece of trickery was beneath me, it was inspired by desperation- but it affected you deeply.",
      "I am sorry for it.",
      "I am even sorrier that it caused you to hate me.' 'Then you have my pardon, my Lord.' 'It cannot be so easily given.'",
      "he grimaced. '",
      "If forgiveness is mine to give, then I shall issue it as I chose.' said the Queen, firmly. 'You have asked for my absolution, sir- why so surprised that I should offer it?'",
      "A wordless expression of sheer frustration escaped King Hades' lips. '",
      "It ought not be so easy as that, Persephone.",
      "You should command a great deed or impossible quest of me, you should ask for my most treasured possession...anything, your pardon is too precious to be simply given at the asking.",
      "I cannot believe my deceit to be forgiven, not without having earnt it. 'Can it be earned?",
      "Surely it is the more valuable for being undeserved.'",
      "She kissed him, quickly on his astonished lips. 'I forgive you, husband.",
      "What is done cannot be undone, your ill deeds against me have changed me but not necessarily for the worse.",
      "I am Persephone, I am Kore.",
      "There is no difference, not within.'",
      "Hades turned away from her, quite overcome.",
      "When he turned back to her, his hands were trembling.",
      "He dropped to his knees before her and for a moment she felt afraid for him.",
      "His distress was so very great. 'Command me.'",
      "My Lord?'",
      "His head was bowed and his hands reached out to the backs of her knees. 'Command me.",
      "I am your supplicant.",
      "I beg you to make some request of me.'",
      "In an instant, Persephone was transported back to her first time in Hades' throne room.",
      "On her knees before him she had made the gesture of supplication that had gone unheeded.",
      "Her heart beat loudly in her chest. 'Husband, please do get up.",
      "This isn't...its not necessary.",
      "I forgive you freely.",
      "There is nothing you could possibly do to make amends so let us regard the matter as closed.",
      "Please.' 'I know it isn't necessary.",
      "I believe you when you say that <i>think</i> you forgive me but...I want to do your bidding.",
      "Do you believe that such mercy as you have shown me can change a man?",
      "Can you understand what you have done?'",
      "He seemed to struggle to take a great gulping breath, and did not rise from his position of humility, but raised a hand to her arm. 'I have never shown mercy, Persephone.",
      "If I allow a soul to escape justice then it is always with a hefty price.",
      "I am undone...you have destroyed me.'",
      "Alarmed now, and utterly confused, Persephone crouched down beside him, burying her fingers in the ground, almost as habit.",
      "New green shoots sprung up, their odor fresh and sweet. 'Hades.",
      "My husband.",
      "I do not think I can understand.",
      "How should forgiveness be so very distressing to you?",
      "Help me comprehend this!' 'I have always despised pity, my beloved.",
      "I had none to spare, neither for myself nor for any other.",
      "I had none for you when I took you from the meadow.",
      "I wanted you, so I took you.",
      "I felt so affected by you at your presentation that I decided then and there that you would be mine.",
      "I gave no thought for your gentle heart, that it would grieve more for Demeter's anxiety than for your own imprisonment.'",
      "he spat out the last word.",
      "Loathing resounded from his every word. 'I stand for iron justice, my queen.",
      "My very nature is unbending.",
      "When I pass judgement on the souls of mortals, no pity- no compassion, is present.",
      "I have wronged you, Persephone- it is all the more abhorrent because you were undeserving of it, nothing but sweetness and grace ever crossed your path before me.",
      "I do not see that it is possible for you to forgive me that.'",
      "She listened in silence at his great outpouring and when he was done, wound her arms around his neck as they knelt in the dirt together.",
      "The shades of the Underworld did not venture to her wood, which was fortunate, she thought, since there was little majestic or powerful about its King and Queen crouching, like children by a tree.",
      "She was glad of it, that this moment of raw honesty was all hers.",
      "She shrouded the wood in shadow and guarded the intimacy with jealousy. '",
      "Oh Hades.'",
      "she whispered. 'Am I still Kore to you then?",
      "A mere girl, unable to discern when she has been wronged and so thus unable to forgive you?",
      "I am more than that, my lord.",
      "You have caused me to be more than that.",
      "It isn't...you need not tell me that you behaved wrongly.",
      "I know it.",
      "I bore the consequences of it, I even despised you for it- briefly.'",
      "she added when he flinched. 'Shall we journey back to Tartarus, husband?",
      "So that I can tell you in the light of truth, with not a trace of falsehood, that you are pardoned?'",
      "The slightest trace of humour found its way into her inflection as she concluded, 'I should prefer not to, you know, it isn't the pleasantest spot I have ever visited...but I shall if you continue to do me the discredit of thinking that I lie.",
      "My forgiveness is a gift to you, dear husband.",
      "If you wish to do me some service...then you may show mercy to the next mortal soul that asks for it, but my mercy is free.'",
      "The scent of the new mint, so fresh and clean, wafted about them.",
      "Her King did not respond in words, he only embraced her in return as they sat in the silence together.",
      "The pair remained entwined, together, for a long while and Persephone's limbs had long since gone stiff with disuse when Hades at last broke the companionable silence. 'I thank you, then.'",
      "Well now, it looks like we are winding down.",
      "It is possible that the next chapter will be the last.",
      "It depends on whether or not I get everything necessary into it.",
      "Thank you, once again to those of you who leave comments, your words cheer me up so much!",
      "I have posted 11 chapters of this now, and I think the panic that no one will like it has only gotten worse!",
      "I am not going to apologise for how 'easily' Persephone forgives Hades, he may have deserved to suffer, but forgiveness like that can and has changed people for the better.",
      "If we all got what we deserved, with no forgiveness or mercy...we'd be in a very sorry state, I think.",
      "*Monster Author Note Alert!*",
      "This last chapter is four and half thousand words, its a long one!",
      "Thank you, thank you and thank you to all you wonderful readers who have left me encouragement.",
      "It means so much, you almost bring me to tears with your kindness.",
      "I would like to dedicate this chapter to the beautiful MarquesadeSantos who has been so encouraging.:)",
      "Also.",
      "If I may indulge in a little self advertisment? http://archiveofourown.org/works/678890/chapters/1244053",
      "This will take you to my ORIGINAL STORY which I am now posting.",
      "If you liked my writing and want to read a bit more, please go over there and enjoy.",
      "It's had even less footfall than I expected Blossoming to have (though you all surprised me!)",
      "and I would love to hear your thoughts on my special 'baby.'",
      "Ok.",
      "Read on!:)",
      "Persephone was true to the promise she had made to herself, in the course of the six months she spent with Hades, she exerted herself to understand him better.",
      "In private, he was more open than she had seen him elsewhere, and his devotion to her comfort and happiness was extremely gratifying.",
      "He seemed to gradually accept that she bore him no ill will, and every so often a lightness was plain to see in his eyes when they rested upon her face.",
      "She ruled by his side each passing day and there was much to be done, for Demeter's winter above the earth, was a harsh one, many mortals had perished.",
      "Persephone knew full well that Demeter, although in awe of him, had despised Hades in the past, on account of his apparent disregard for the lives of the weaker beings that populated the world.",
      "It was not lost on her that her mother, who had so carefully raised her to cherish every living thing, was bent on a path of destruction.",
      "Hades deserved his fearsome reputation, it was evident- but so too did Demeter earn the one that she was surely making for herself.",
      "The Queen herself, heard whispers of the stories being told about her, Orpheus had kept his word to her at least and wave upon wave of wandering souls pitied her for a while - until she passed judgement on them, and they saw the steely adherence to duty in Hades' beautiful Queen.",
      "She asked her husband, after having dismissed yet another plea for mercy from a grief stricken widow, what had happened to the gifted bard and his unfortunate wife.",
      "Hades grimaced. '",
      "He disregarded the rules, and looked back.",
      "Eurydice was returned to her destiny.",
      "They will meet again in death.'",
      "There was no flinching from the truth, not as Hades' consort.",
      "Persephone sighed. 'Tis a pity.",
      "He had enough devotion, but not enough faith and courage.",
      "His wife must face the double disappointment of returning here and having a husband who lacks the necessary resolution to keep her.",
      "Perhaps their reunion will be the sweeter for the separation.'",
      "Hades looked thoughtful, as he beckoned forth the next shade to be judged. '",
      "As will ours, my Lady?",
      "Hephaestus' gift to you shows that your departure is soon, the mortals will feel the bounty of the earth again and it is this realm that will be in want of Springtime.'",
      "Persephone felt wistful. 'I shall return, my Lord.",
      "In terms of eternity, half a year is not so very long.",
      "I...I shall miss you above all, I think.'",
      "She added, hesitantly.",
      "He had taken much persuading of her forgiveness, he was unlikely to accept that he held him in some considerable affection and esteem.",
      "Hades grimaced again. 'You will take my very heart with you, Lady wife, when you return to the world above.",
      "Will you return it to me when you come back, I wonder?",
      "Every moment out of your company seems an agonizing eon to me.",
      "I dread your departure, even as much as the mortals fear death.",
      "If Hades is to love his wife, then the Underworld will offer no comfort whilst you are gone.'",
      "Persephone's breath rushed out of her and tears blossomed. 'I shall return.",
      "Springtime must be brought to the mortals, if my mother's cruel curse on the land were to go unbroken, what would become of us?",
      "Would this noble court crumble and break when there were no more mortals to come hither for judgement?",
      "I shall return to you my husband.",
      "Each day that I am with you, I feel more and more, how much I could love you and how much I will cherish you as the ages roll on.",
      "Perhaps our time apart will leave me as desolate as it will you, I cannot yet tell.'",
      "Hades stared at her and was did not reply until they heard the case of the soul before them.",
      "A pleasant judgement to be passed, the child had passed an innocent, unerring life and was destined for Elysium.",
      "His love shone from his dark eyes when he turned back to Persephone, as bright and as precious to her as any jewel to be found in the earth.",
      "Hades caught her hand to his lips. 'You will love me then, little wife?",
      "Even apart from me, shall you think of me often?' his voice quivered, but he held himself in check. '",
      "Only think of me with a little fondness and smile at me like that every so often and if my kingdom does fade and my power desert me, I shall have lived a fulfilled and joyous existence.'",
      "Persephone startled, wove her fingers into his hair, uncaring of the shades that drifted in the throne room. '",
      "Do you think it possible, Hades?",
      "That we can simply cease to be?'",
      "He immediately leaned into her touch, with a small sound of contentment. 'Fret not, my dear.",
      "We shall have long grown weary of this order before it ends, as everything must.'",
      "It was too strange a thought for his wife, who wrapped her arms around him, seeking comfort before the pair rose as one and wended their way to the shores of the river Styx.",
      "Time passed and all too soon the time for her to return above the earth arrived.",
      "Hephaestus' orb seemed to glow brighter as the lights within met.",
      "Persephone looked anxiously to her husband's saddened countenance.",
      "It was not necessarily that his expressions had become more easily read, but rather with each moment of closeness she understood him better.",
      "Her heart ached for him, for his loneliness even as she wished to see her mother once more.",
      "He took her to the entrance to the Underworld himself, saying nothing, merely holding her hand with such quiet solemnity that she could not but weep.",
      "He kissed her tears away and uttered a husky farewell. 'Think of me, Persephone, when you light up the world above.",
      "Think of me, cast into darkness without you.'",
      "She nodded, unable to speak.",
      "A lump caught in her throat that she could not swallow down.",
      "She walked out into the, too bright, sunlight and could not bring herself to look back for fear that she would break her poor mother's heart by begging to remain with him.",
      "She did not consider the state of her own, for if she did she might go mad with confusion.",
      "Demeter met her, some way away from the slopes, beneath which she had said goodbye to the dark Hades.",
      "Her mother wept openly on her daughter's shoulder, Persephone looked about her in damp eyed dismay at the frosty, desolate earth.",
      "The lush greenery was gone, the world above looked exactly as she had supposed the Underworld might look, when she had been a child and prone to such imaginings.",
      "She pressed her mouth into a thin line of disapproval, it was an expression that had recently had the court of the Underworld quailing in fear- though it brought a gleam of amusement to somber Hades' dark eyes.",
      "She shook of that train of thought, a curious tightness in her chest at the thought of her husband. 'I am with you once more, my mother.",
      "Now let there be bounty and beauty on the earth again.",
      "Let there be no more suffering for the innocent mortals.",
      "Come, show me your lovely crops and flowers.'",
      "Demeter felt her daughter's reproach, gently worded though it was and frowned. '",
      "You look entirely grown up, my girl.",
      "If only you had remained the adorable child you were before you were wrested from me!'",
      "She sighed, pitifully. 'Very well, I shall bless the world once more.",
      "There will be a glorious harvest, bountiful enough that if the people are careful it will last them throughout the expression of my sorrow.",
      "They must carefully store up their grain, as I shall carefully keep my moments of happiness with you.",
      "Take off that crown, my love- I will weave flowers into your hair.'",
      "Persephone shook her head. 'I will keep the crown, my dear mother, but would be glad to see bright blooms in your locks- you do not look half so much like Demeter without them.' 'Oh very well then.'",
      "grumbled Demeter, good naturedly and set about bringing life to the dead ground beneath them.",
      "Helios shone warmly down upon them in approval.",
      "Very soon the dryads and the nymphs came out from their secret places, rejoicing in the return of the younger goddess.",
      "Very soon there was laughter and dancing about her as she was greeted by her erstwhile companions.",
      "Persephone stood in the midst of them, quietly dignified as they frolicked and commented on her sober manner and lovely clothes.",
      "She was not unhappy precisely, but the months ahead of her seemed looming and long and the ache in her heart became stronger and sharper at the thought of such a long separation from him.",
      "It did not escape Demeter that her daughter was thus subdued.",
      "At first she attributed it to left over unhappiness from being away from the meadow for so long, but when her melancholy seemed to grow stronger as the time passed she knew that it could not be the sole reason.",
      "Her daughter's appetite was affected and although she daintily picked over the food that was offered, very little was actually eaten.",
      "It pained Demeter to see her child unhappy and she redoubled her efforts in entertaining and feeding her.",
      "In truth, the only thing that really seemed to please her majesty was the sight of nature growing and blooming about them.",
      "Seeing Demeter fulfilling her duty brought pleasure to Persephone's eyes, even as she thought wistfully of her own duty as Hades' consort that was being neglected as she did nothing with her mother.",
      "Her brow furrowed when it occurred to her that Hades, when he took her to Olympus, had been right- absolutely right.",
      "It was not natural for her to be torn between her life as a maiden and that of a wife.",
      "She was surely the only one, goddess or mortal, who was so divided.",
      "One day in late summer, the King of the Underworld visited the meadow as she sat with Demeter among the dancing poppies.",
      "The pair of them had been weaving lilies into braids for amusement.",
      "The days work was done, the trees bowed under the weight of heavy fruit, the barley and wheat grains were swelled with ripeness and mortals scurried about trying to gather it all in.",
      "They heard the rumbling of his horses hooves beneath the ground and this time Persephone knew what was afoot, especially in conjunction with her mother's spluttering outrage- uttering her husbands name like it was a curse when his chariot rent the ground in two.",
      "A darkly amused gleam appeared in Persephone's eyes as she considered that his name was not so much of a curse as hers was and did he absolutely have to rile up his sister even further by leaving a great gaping hole in the ground?",
      "The grass still would not grow over the spot where he had last come above ground, from.",
      "Demeter did not speak of it, but Persephone had seen her standing there- scowling in concentration with her bare feet sunk deep into the ground, but still no grass would grow.",
      "He left his horses some distance away and stood a little way off just looking at her.",
      "Demeter stormed over to him, ire flashing in her eyes- she looked magnificent and intimidating but Hades just stood still, watching.",
      "He did not even deign to glance at her until she addressed him. 'It is not yet time for your turn, Lord Hades.",
      "You are not welcome in my meadow.'",
      "Persephone's eyebrows rose slightly at Demeters blatant disrespect and she stood from her spot and padded gracefully over to them. 'I need no welcome from you in order to see my wife, Demeter.'",
      "His voice was quiet, soft and smooth, but so sinister that Demeter gulped. '",
      "It isn't your turn!'",
      "She sounded so petulant that Persephone stifled a laugh, it was a tone of voice that she had heard all too often from disgruntled mortals, who had been judged according to their actions and misliked the results.",
      "Their displeasure never made any difference to Hades. 'Mother.'",
      "She said softly, 'I hardly mind.",
      "The Fates put no such sanctions on us that I cannot speak to either of you whilst the other has me.'",
      "Demeter whipped around to face her daughter, rage and disappointment turning her lovely features twisted and ugly.",
      "She opened her mouth to vent her anger at her daughter and then closed it again hurriedly when powerful Hades raised his hand to still her tirade before it even began.",
      "Demeter's shoulders sagged. 'I will finish the lilies then.'",
      "She muttered, and stalked off.",
      "Persephone reached for Hades' hand, smiling. '",
      "What brings you, husband?'",
      "She asked. 'I thought perhaps, you might like to know of a promise fulfilled.'",
      "He said quietly, his eyes were soft as he looked into hers.",
      "He leant forward and breathed in the fresh scent of spring that engulfed her. 'You asked me to grant mercy to the next one that asked it of me.",
      "Heracles, son of Zeus, journeyed down to our palace and pleaded for the life of Theseus, King of Athens.",
      "I granted it.",
      "Pirithous, of course, remains.'",
      "Persephone digested this, blinking.",
      "Hades did not rush her, simply playing idly with a smooth curl by twisting it around his finger. 'I thank you then, I suppose.",
      "It cannot have been an easy promise to keep.",
      "It is unfortunate that the first request for mercy came for one who has injured us.",
      "Nevertheless, it was well done of you.",
      "Heracles will remember it.",
      "Thank you for coming so far to tell me...",
      "I am glad to see you.'",
      "And she was.",
      "The aching, empty feeling that had pervaded her heart since she had left him, had gone.",
      "In its place was something akin to the joy she felt when a new flower blossomed and spread open its petals to the sunlight.",
      "It was not love, not in the romantic sense that Aphrodite advocated and Zeus abused- but perhaps she did care for him, as a wife ought to care for her husband.",
      "It was time to take responsibility for the course of her own life. 'Hades.'",
      "She said, and he looked up from his engrossment with the twist of dark hair around his fourth finger. 'What...' she felt so nervous and awkward, 'would you be...' she stopped and tried again, 'When the summer ends, I should like to end this ridiculous business of my life being split in two.'",
      "She expelled out a breath once she had said it, pleased to have it out in the open.",
      "The large hand that played with her hair stilled.",
      "The ground about Hades feet turned black and withered.",
      "Death spread outward in a circle about them, ever widening until the blooms in Demeters hands shrivelled up, causing her to drop them in alarm.",
      "Persephone held her breath, not comprehending the bleakness in Hades, now lifted, gaze. 'Hades!",
      "Please cease!",
      "I thought you'd be pleased.'",
      "He seemed unreachable for a moment, so dreadful and stern that Persephone's courage was sorely tested to even speak to him.",
      "At her honest words and earnest look, he flicked his finger and the destruction stopped, leaving the King and Queen standing in the centre of a perfect circle of withered nature.",
      "Demeter stood on the edge of the circle, either unwilling or unable to step foot into it.",
      "Hades took his wife's face in both palms and made her look at him square in the eye.",
      "He looked both afraid and ready to do battle.",
      "She twisted in his grasp, freeing herself and pulled his lips down to hers.",
      "He gasped out, in between kisses, 'I suppose you did not mean that as I interpreted it.'",
      "He held her gently, slightly away from him so that he could watch her expression and asked, 'Do you mean to say, that when you come home to me, that it will be forever?'",
      "At her nod, he smiled, palpably relieved, and Persephone marvelled at it. 'I adore you, Persephone.' 'Yes,' she replied, seriously, 'I know it.",
      "I...am not happy when you are not by, Hades.",
      "These few months ought to have been joyous for me, but instead my chest has ached at the very thought of you, as if it is empty and is longing to be filled again.",
      "I want to be a good wife to you, to make you happy, to be a good Queen-",
      "I think I can be, I will certainly try.'",
      "She blushed when he brushed her mouth gently with a finger, hushing her.",
      "She knew she was in danger of babbling. '",
      "But you do not know if you love me?",
      "My little love, if you feel all this for me, I shall count myself blessed.",
      "If one day you can bring yourself to name it in the same way as others would, then I am doubly fortunate.",
      "There is no hurry, Persephone.",
      "If you are to choose to live with me, the kingdom will celebrate rapturously for days, for weeks, on end.'",
      "She did not notice the tears tracing her way down her cheeks until her husband brushed them away with the back of his hand. 'You will not mind if I come to see my mother often?'",
      "He let out a breath. 'Mind?",
      "How should I mind, knowing that you have chosen me?",
      "You are free to come and go as you please, my love- I don't imagine Demeter will look favourably on this new arrangement- but perhaps if you visit frequently, she will understand that I'll not keep you apart, not now.'",
      "He stooped a little to kiss her brow, 'You may have anything and everything you desire, my Queen, I swear it.' 'You will spoil me then, I will become unbearable.'",
      "She ventured a tease, pleased when she saw an answering glint in his eye. '",
      "Oh no, I do not think it possible, Lady wife.",
      "To remain unspoilt is in your nature, it is part of your charm and character.",
      "Even if I were shower you with jewels and all the riches of the earth, I know, full well, that you will remain as you are.'",
      "He drew a finger to her nape and traced a path around her throat, he made a low pleased hum in his throat when her breath quickened and she leant forward to kiss him once more. '",
      "A moment', he murmured softly in her ear, 'your mother is rapidly working herself into a rage, I must be gone soon.",
      "I can wait with more patience now, knowing that you wish to be with me.'",
      "When he lifted his finger from the skin of her neck, Persephone felt a cold weight resting there.",
      "A collar of diamonds and gold wound their way in a perfect circle about her slender throat.",
      "Satisfaction practically oozed from him and his wife could not help but chuckle when his hands went to her waist and he crushed his mouth to hers.",
      "They bade a fond, passionate, farewell and Persephone felt a good deal lighter of heart than she had at their last parting.",
      "She made her way back to Demeter, who knelt in the dirt, steadily coaxing life up from the dead ground.",
      "Persephone stooped to aid her, silently causing a clump of purple heather to spring forth. 'I hope he will not visit here often, my daughter.'",
      "Said the goddess of the crops, dryly. '",
      "The affect on my meadow is quite devastating.",
      "Looking about her, Persephone nodded her head in agreement.",
      "At least this time plants could grow again in the cursed soil. '",
      "He will have no cause to, mother.'",
      "She said quietly, watching Demeter's face change as she comprehended her meaning.",
      "Demeter took her hands out from the soil and knelt up. 'You have chosen him, then?",
      "Over me?'",
      "Her mother's eyes were glassy with tears, but they did not fall. '",
      "Only so far as that I chose to be a wife to him over this half life that I am living.",
      "I will always be your daughter, always love you and bless you for having given me life.",
      "I will visit you often, even in the winter time.",
      "I can come when I please.",
      "Hades...he is very generous, Mother.'",
      "Demeter flicked her earthy fingers to the priceless diamonds about the young woman's neck and raised a brow. '",
      "So I see.' 'I don't mean like that, dear one.",
      "I mean, he promises that I shall do as I please- he wants my happiness above all things.' 'He didn't care for that when he tore you away from me!",
      "He didn't even think of it.'",
      "Exclaimed Demeter.",
      "Persephone dug her hands into the ground again and watched as mint sprung up vigorously at her urging. '",
      "Do you not believe that people can change, mother?",
      "That experience and regret can alter a man?' 'Not him, not us!",
      "We do not change.",
      "We are immortal, some things ought to stay unaltered.'",
      "It was grief that brought the frown to Demeter's face, it was plain to see.",
      "Persephone saw the lie for what it was, living with Hades had given her a distaste for dishonesty, even if it was unconscious. '",
      "But you have, haven't you, Mother?'",
      "Her voice was hard and disapproving. 'You, who were so dedicated to your duty, but now will allow the innocent to starve to death on account of caprice.",
      "It was not they that changed things, the mortals have no say in such things, why make them suffer?",
      "Why send them to judgement in Hades' Realm?'",
      "Demeter gaped at her and flinched when Persephone regally lifted her chin.",
      "Even without her crown and throne, her daughter was a Queen, Demeter saw it and averted her gaze in submission.",
      "The Queen of the Underworld continued on as though the dynamic between mother and daughter had not just subtly, permanently, shifted. 'Whatever you may believe, we are all capable of change whether it be for the better or for worse.",
      "Hades has remained as he is for eons, why should he not alter- even in the slightest sense, in order to please me?' 'When will you go?' Demeter wept. 'When Hephaestus' orb shows that it is my time to return to the Underworld.",
      "We have the rest of the summer.",
      "I will visit often, throughout the winter...perhaps you will allow the mortals some respite, knowing that it will not be so very long before I next see you.'",
      "Demeter nodded. '",
      "Yes...perhaps.'",
      "At one time, Persephone would have launched herself into her mother's arms at this concession, but now she remained slightly apart, a distance had grown between them- both women were aware of it, but it did not feel unnatural.",
      "Demeter busied herself with the soil again.",
      "Rosemary grew at her behest, sweet and fragrant. 'Hephaestus wanted to court you, you know.",
      "He asked me immediately after your presentation.",
      "It would have been a good match, he doesn't have Hades' rank, of course...but he is a kind man.",
      "I rejected him outright and not in pleasant terms.",
      "It strikes me now that things would have been so different if I had asked you, if I had allowed you to grow up.' 'I was not destined to be his wife, mother- you heard the Fates as well as I. Things are as they ought to be.",
      "Besides, from what I understand you were not the only one to depress his pretentions to my hand.",
      "Hades had already decided he would have me.'",
      "She waved her hands expressively toward the heavy jewels around her neck and the subject was closed.",
      "The two women turned their complete attention to repairing the extensive damage to the meadow.",
      "The rest of the summer was peaceful, Demeter clearly tried to come to terms with the realisation that her little girl was now a grown woman, and a powerful one at that.",
      "Persephone in turn did not begrudge her mother her wistful tears that came often.",
      "Together they revisited their happiest memories, Demeter told Persephone the tale of her birth and reluctantly answered her questions about her romance with Zeus.",
      "At the time the lights crossed in the, henceforth useless, orb, Demeter walked with her child and companions to the edge of the River Styx.",
      "They bedecked Persephone in the robes of a bride, with flowers woven into her hair.",
      "It was not a wedding, that moment had already passed, but Demeter wished to demonstrate to her daughter, more than anyone, that her love was as eternal as her heart.",
      "Hades stood on the far shore, watching the procession with curiosity.",
      "His Queen, with a fond kiss to her mother's dewy cheek, stepped onto the boat.",
      "It dipped slightly, riding lower in the water with her weight.",
      "Charon, his pole held loosely in skeletal hands, watched her from beneath a tattered cowl.",
      "Persephone tilted her head imperiously towards him. '",
      "Well then, boatman.",
      "Carry me across.",
      "My Lord Husband awaits me.",
      "I am anxious to return home.'",
      "She saw the slight tremble of his fingers before he gripped the pole and pushed it into the murky water.",
      "She hid her smile by turning back towards the shore behind her and raising her fingers in farewell to her mother.",
      "She had no regrets behind her and an abundance of hope ahead of her.",
      "When she looked back to the shore ahead, she found that she could not look away.",
      "Hades stood tall and proud, the light from the Nether-sun behind him casting his face into shadow.",
      "She did not need to see his face clearly in order to know that there was a lurking smile in his eyes.",
      "All was quiet, save for the lapping of the water against the wooden craft and the occasional soft thud of Charon's pole hitting a rock on the river bed.",
      "Very soon, the whole realm would be filled with noise and celebration, Hades had decreed it.",
      "This time there would be no division of food, nor of heart.",
      "The boat came to a halt on the black sandy shore and King Hades stepped forward to take her hand, assisting to alight.",
      "She curtseyed, he bowed... and Persephone was home."

    "text": "The wind was cold, and smelled of salt. White sand pooled against black rock, stretching against the sea for miles. In a small, brown hut by the shore, golden light winked and flickered; low voices murmured in the doorway, swallowed up by the breeze. Peleus' horse shifted restlessly under him. This was not a natural place, and the road he had taken to come here had filled the beast with fear. She was calmer now, but still smelled of sweat and stress. His guide, a short man, clothed in a simple white tunic, handed the mare's reins to Peleus. \"I can go no further here, your majesty,\" he said. Peleus nodded. \"I understand. She is within, then?\" \"Aye, and your son, too.\" A curious, cold feeling settled into the back of Peleus' throat. A year ago, he had come to this same place, dressed in finery, and attended by a dozen servants. They had slaughtered cattle and sung hymns before crossing into this netherworld of sea and stone. Now, he returned, to gather the fruits of that labor. Slowly, he began to descend a rocky path to the shore. His mare held her ears flat as they descended, the clop of her hooves echoing into the night sky. It seemed to take forever, but eventually, he came to the door of the hut. He dismounted, and did not bother to tie up his horse before entering; he knew that the beast would not wander in this place. The inside of the hut was stark and simple. The last time that he had come, the house had been a palace, with cool tile floors, guttering torches set in bronze bowls and beautiful woven cloths hung on the wall. It had been his marriage day, and his new bride, beautiful and golden, had explained to him that the palace changed its look in accordance with her moods. And so, Peleus wondered how he would find his bride in this rude little house. Seated in front of the fire, her tunic creased elegantly across her back; white linen against polished oak. Her dark hair was piled high, formally braided and crowned with twinkling blue gems. She did not breathe. Peleus walked slowly around, not sure how to begin. She was, after all, his wife, and owed him obedience, but she was also a goddess, and the king was not a foolish man, to risk her unhappiness. \"Daughter of the sea,\" he began, but she raised a hand to silence him. \"You have come for your son?\" She turned to look at Peleus, her eyes were the color of warm water over white sand. \"I have, my wife,\" he said. His voice was more tender, now. \"You have come early, then, husband. For I have given birth, it is true, but we are not delivered of a son, as was promised us.\" Peleus drew in his breath sharply. He knew, of course, that he ran a risk when he took a goddess to bed; he had heard tell of Minotaurs, spined hydras and dread basilisks. But the Oracle had promised him a firstborn, human child, and he had not worried overmuch. He looked down from his wife's perfect face, and saw that she held a swaddled infant at her breast. While most of the child was covered by cloth, its face, at least, seemed human enough, with bright red hair and flabby cheeks. He reached down to touch the child, and it took ahold of his finger. The child had a surprisingly strong grip. His wife looked up sharply. Her movements were alarmingly precise; sliding smoothly into each expression. \"Look you,\" she said, as she unwrapped the swaddling cloth.Peleus looked hard at the child, then he laughed. \"Is that all? I was afraid that we had birthed a monster.\"Thetis' expression remained inscrutable. \"Peleus, if you let it live, this will be the child that outstrips you. Do you really want a daughter? She will be beautiful, but there are many beautiful women in the world. Your kingdom needs a prince.\" \"What, then, would you have me do with this girl?\" Her expression was a hidden reef in stormy weather. \"Kill her.\" Blood drained from the king's face. \"Are you mad? You were courted by Zeus and Poseidon for this child. Do you think that the goddesses beneath the earth will not take note of her spilled blood?\" \"If we do not spill blood, then the gracious ones will have no need to look for vengeance. We can leave her to the rocks and the sea, or if you like, I will give her to the fire. And when she is dead, I will come to you again.\" Something about the goddess shifted, and she was no longer ice, but warm and beautiful, like silver under sunlight. Peleus felt himself grow painfully hard; he knew that he could not argue with her. Thetis did not wait for her husband's response, but the air stirred briefly, and the hut grew huge around them, changing into a hall of black stone. The hut's simple hearth had grown to match the proportions of the hall; it was now a large, stone basin, where smoke drifted up to meet the stars. At a word from Thetis, the simmering coals burst into flame, radiating a dizzying heat and light. Thetis stood, and her hair tumbled down from its elaborate coif, becoming a waterfall of dark silk. Holding the child, she walked into the fire. The smell was awful. Peleus could smell burning hair and roasting meat. Suddenly, the child let out an anguished wail, her scream shockingly loud. The king had heard men die before, and he closed his ears to the sound, and waited for his wife. She seemed to stand in the fire for a year, or maybe it was only the length of a heartbeat. Peleus did not know how to measure the time that passed; he simply stood and stared at her, while the fire leapt up towards her bronze skin, before sizzling out, as though doused by rain. The child, though, was not so lucky. The skin turned red at first, then puckered into darker purple hues and ashy grey before it finally stopped screaming. The fire died down gradually. Thetis was perfectly still, more like carved marble than flesh and blood. Peleus ached with desire. Finally, she turned toward him from the glowing coals. Her red lips were creased in a frown, and she held the dead child. \"She lives yet,\" Thetis said. Lost for words, and amazed, Peleus said the first thing that came to his mind. \"What do you want to call her, then?\"",

      "His guide, a short man, clothed in a simple white tunic, handed the mare's reins to Peleus.",
      "\"I can go no further here, your majesty,\" he said.",
      "Peleus nodded.",
      "\"I understand.",
      "She is within, then?\"",
      "\"Aye, and your son, too.\"",
      "A curious, cold feeling settled into the back of Peleus' throat.",
      "A year ago, he had come to this same place, dressed in finery, and attended by a dozen servants.",
      "They had slaughtered cattle and sung hymns before crossing into this netherworld of sea and stone.",
      "Now, he returned, to gather the fruits of that labor.",
      "Slowly, he began to descend a rocky path to the shore.",
      "His mare held her ears flat as they descended, the clop of her hooves echoing into the night sky.",
      "It seemed to take forever, but eventually, he came to the door of the hut.",
      "He dismounted, and did not bother to tie up his horse before entering; he knew that the beast would not wander in this place.",
      "The inside of the hut was stark and simple.",
      "The last time that he had come, the house had been a palace, with cool tile floors, guttering torches set in bronze bowls and beautiful woven cloths hung on the wall.",
      "It had been his marriage day, and his new bride, beautiful and golden, had explained to him that the palace changed its look in accordance with her moods.",
      "And so, Peleus wondered how he would find his bride in this rude little house.",
      "Seated in front of the fire, her tunic creased elegantly across her back; white linen against polished oak.",
      "Her dark hair was piled high, formally braided and crowned with twinkling blue gems.",
      "She did not breathe.",
      "Peleus walked slowly around, not sure how to begin.",
      "She was, after all, his wife, and owed him obedience, but she was also a goddess, and the king was not a foolish man, to risk her unhappiness.",
      "\"Daughter of the sea,\" he began, but she raised a hand to silence him.",
      "\"You have come for your son?\"",
      "She turned to look at Peleus, her eyes were the color of warm water over white sand.",
      "\"I have, my wife,\" he said.",
      "His voice was more tender, now.",
      "\"You have come early, then, husband.",
      "For I have given birth, it is true, but we are not delivered of a son, as was promised us.\"",
      "Peleus drew in his breath sharply.",
      "He knew, of course, that he ran a risk when he took a goddess to bed; he had heard tell of Minotaurs, spined hydras and dread basilisks.",
      "But the Oracle had promised him a firstborn, human child, and he had not worried overmuch.",
      "He looked down from his wife's perfect face, and saw that she held a swaddled infant at her breast.",
      "While most of the child was covered by cloth, its face, at least, seemed human enough, with bright red hair and flabby cheeks.",
      "He reached down to touch the child, and it took ahold of his finger.",
      "The child had a surprisingly strong grip.",
      "His wife looked up sharply.",
      "Her movements were alarmingly precise; sliding smoothly into each expression.",
      "\"Look you,\" she said, as she unwrapped the swaddling cloth.Peleus looked hard at the child, then he laughed.",
      "\"Is that all?",
      "I was afraid that we had birthed a monster.\"Thetis' expression remained inscrutable.",
      "\"Peleus, if you let it live, this will be the child that outstrips you.",
      "Do you really want a daughter?",
      "She will be beautiful, but there are many beautiful women in the world.",
      "Your kingdom needs a prince.\"",
      "\"What, then, would you have me do with this girl?\"",
      "Her expression was a hidden reef in stormy weather.",
      "\"Kill her.\"",
      "Blood drained from the king's face.",
      "\"Are you mad?",
      "You were courted by Zeus and Poseidon for this child.",
      "Do you think that the goddesses beneath the earth will not take note of her spilled blood?\"",
      "\"If we do not spill blood, then the gracious ones will have no need to look for vengeance.",
      "We can leave her to the rocks and the sea, or if you like, I will give her to the fire.",
      "And when she is dead, I will come to you again.\"",
      "Something about the goddess shifted, and she was no longer ice, but warm and beautiful, like silver under sunlight.",
      "Peleus felt himself grow painfully hard; he knew that he could not argue with her.",
      "Thetis did not wait for her husband's response, but the air stirred briefly, and the hut grew huge around them, changing into a hall of black stone.",
      "The hut's simple hearth had grown to match the proportions of the hall; it was now a large, stone basin, where smoke drifted up to meet the stars.",
      "At a word from Thetis, the simmering coals burst into flame, radiating a dizzying heat and light.",
      "Thetis stood, and her hair tumbled down from its elaborate coif, becoming a waterfall of dark silk.",
      "Holding the child, she walked into the fire.",
      "The smell was awful.",
      "Peleus could smell burning hair and roasting meat.",
      "Suddenly, the child let out an anguished wail, her scream shockingly loud.",
      "The king had heard men die before, and he closed his ears to the sound, and waited for his wife.",
      "She seemed to stand in the fire for a year, or maybe it was only the length of a heartbeat.",
      "Peleus did not know how to measure the time that passed; he simply stood and stared at her, while the fire leapt up towards her bronze skin, before sizzling out, as though doused by rain.",
      "The child, though, was not so lucky.",
      "The skin turned red at first, then puckered into darker purple hues and ashy grey before it finally stopped screaming.",
      "The fire died down gradually.",
      "Thetis was perfectly still, more like carved marble than flesh and blood.",
      "Peleus ached with desire.",
      "Finally, she turned toward him from the glowing coals.",
      "Her red lips were creased in a frown, and she held the dead child.",
      "\"She lives yet,\" Thetis said.",
      "Lost for words, and amazed, Peleus said the first thing that came to his mind.",
      "\"What do you want to call her, then?\""

    "text": "When the time came for Laura to return to the Hale holdings, she realized that Lydia was missing. Frantic, she ordered the others to help her search; to leave no stone unturned until they were sure Lydia was safe. Because although Lydia was under Hale protection, she was still mortal, and therefore vulnerable, not everyone respected that protection, as proven by Peter. The discarded wolfsbane plant was eventually discovered, and Laura, recognizing her family's magical signature, flew into a rage. She knew that none who lived aboveground would dare touch anyone under her protection, and so she knew this must be Peter--the uncle of hers that had been banished long ago. Around the same time her mistress had discovered her to be missing, Lydia was with Peter, who was attempting to tempt her with the fruits of the Underworld. Both literally and figuratively, for though he was trying to entice Lydia to eat, Peter was also trying to woo Lydia with the gems that form beneath the ground and the other riches he had had time to amass. Neither of them realized it yet, but Peter's wolf had chosen Lydia as his mate. He may not have intended it as anything more when he took her, but she would never be parted from him now. But Lydia had yet to be tempted. For she was as wise as she was beautiful and she knew that to eat the food of the realm of darkness was to become one of its members permanently. She did not trust Peter, let alone love him, and all she wanted at that moment was to return home. Unfortunately, the Alpha was required to deny her request. Though he had the power to summon Peter, he did not know if he had the power to keep him aboveground, and there was only so much he could do without inciting a war. Those that were banished did not always go quietly, and some were still powerful, but they accepted the rulings. They agreed to stay away because they were left alone in their exile; no one tried to make them play by the rules anymore, and no one told them what to do. Alpha Hale knew that they had to do something--Peter Hale could not be allowed to set a precedent that this was acceptable--but they could not march on the Underworld either. Peter would be punished eventually, but it would take time to find a solution, and this was intolerable for Laura. Weres are inherently connected to nature, and the Hales were no exception. Laura's rage was so great that the forest itself from where Lydia was taken began to cry out in agony as it withered and died. The dryads and the nymphs and the sprites came to her and begged her to allow the forests to grow again, but she ignored them. Even her Alpha came to her when she turned the others away, but Laura refused to listen or allow anything else to grow in her domain until Lydia was returned to her. She would not sit idly by and do nothing while someone who was supposed to be in care was suffering.",

    "text": "The alarm system didn't go off because the five intruders materialized inside the house rather than breaking in. Two of them promptly slid to the ground, folding at the joints in ways that made it clear they still had bones, although any control of the muscles over those bones was another matter. A third person threw out a hand to brace himself on the arm of the couch, trying to watch in every direction at once despite the patch over one eye and the blood pouring into the other. The last two were doing the best job of staying upright; the shorter figure prowled straight to a lamp and turned it on, revealing that they were in a den -- coffee table, couch, comfortable chairs on either side of a fireplace, French doors out to a lawn -- with a half-closed door to one side and an eating bar to the other. The light reflected back off steel just past the bar, probably a kitchen. The fifth figure looked around. The rooms were clean and didn't have demons -- good enough. \"Definitely not England. Blast it,\" Giles said tiredly. He put down his crossbow and ran a hand through his hair, shedding a few grey hairs and several small pieces of plaster as he did, then knelt to make sure Buffy was still breathing. Whatever that last blast had been, it had scorched her clothing and knocked her senseless. \"I do hope the homeowners have a first aid kit.\" Xander dropped stiffly to one knee beside Willow, one hand on his battle axe and the other settling on her throat to check her pulse under hair scorched short on one side. \"Willow is... out. How far did she send us?\" Oz settled down on the other side of Buffy and wrapped what was left of his shirt around her leg; she had a long, sluggishly oozing slash that hadn't had time to close up. \"Looks American, Giles. Definitely warmer than London would be. English-speaking from the books on the coffee table.\" He pulled a blanket off the couch and knelt to wrap it over Willow, then went still. He waved Xander into the shadows with one swift gesture, freezing himself. \"So we are,\" a deep, annoyed voice said from the still-dark kitchen. \"Although we could manage more than a few other languages if absolutely necessary.\" \"Later, Xan.\" That came from a second voice, almost as deep, both of the men sounding American, not British. Giles had made it upright again to look for medical supplies or failing that, the makings of an ice pack. He turned in time to see two naked men prowl in and split to flank the Scoobies, swords and axes in hands. They were alert and awake despite the obvious lateness of the hour... and surprisingly familiar, especially with swords in hands. \"Dear God,\" Giles said softly. \"Of all the places-- Alex, Xan. Help.\" Xan blinked, stared, then identified him correctly. \"Rupert?\" He nodded once, settling immediately into the practicalities as he always had, thank goodness. \"Of course.\" He looked around, said, \"Med-kit and kettle,\" and went back into the kitchen, turning a light on as he went. Alex gave Giles an equally surprised look but he was smiling too. \"It's good to see you.\" He nodded to Oz and Xander, his smile fading as he took in the condition of the new arrivals. \"Even in these straits. All of you are bleeding.\" He set his weapons onto the coffee table; the blades fit in all too well with the debris from their arrival. \"Who's worst?\" Oz just pointed. \"Here. Buffy's probably worst.\" Concise hand gestures matched names to people as he went on, \"Xander's not much better. Willow's just exhausted, I think.\" Alex nodded. \"Right. Xan's getting the medical supplies. Ziploc bags are in the second drawer down just to the left of the fridge. Get some ice on Xander's head. Giles, can you get these two while I check on the women?\" His eyes narrowed in a familiar way which told Giles his own wounds had also been evaluated and added to the triage list. What Alex said, however, was, \"The tea's in the hanging baskets to the left of the kettle. Start a pot and make it strong. You look exhausted.\" Xander clearly considered protesting, then looked at Giles, shrugged, and said, \"I gotta hear this later, G-Man. Naked armed men wander in and you just say help?\" \"It is our house,\" Xan called from the kitchen. \"And you're bleeding all over it. Get in here so I can see if that needs stitches or just an icepack.\" Giles waved Oz over to get a shoulder under Xander's arm; Oz, bless him, ignored the blood down Xander's shoulder and back, and got him moving into the kitchen. One down. Giles sighed in relief, brushed more ichor and ash out of his hair, and crouched down to move Buffy. \"Rupert. Either go make tea or sit down to supervise.\" Alex was on one knee beside Willow, one hand resting lightly on a pulse point in her throat, the other gently peeling her eyes open to check the pupils. \"I'll put you to work when I know where to start.\" Giles sighed again. \"Tea. Yes.\" He felt obligated to caution them, \"Don't wake either Buffy or Willow precipitously. And if Buffy won't release the weapon, I recommend you leave it in her hand.\" Alex nodded carefully and Giles relaxed a little more; it was lovely working with someone else who heard layered warnings. \"I'll do my best. Go on.\" ~ ~ ~ Oz had gone through a full plate of eggs, ham, and cheese himself and finished the rest of Xander's. Xander had eaten half his plate only because Alex, the one who looked like a partially reformed pirate, had refused to give him painkillers until Xander had something in his stomach. He was trying to stay awake and ask questions, but blood loss was messing with his plan. Alex kept refilling his mug with beef broth and Xander kept sipping it, too spaced out to realize it should have been empty a good while back. Xan, the blond who looked like he'd be good to run with, came back down the stairs, wearing jeans at least -- probably because Xander's freak-out ratio was showing -- and with his arm full of clothes, enough for all three of the conscious. He pointed to a side room across the entry way from one of the library doors. \"There's a shower and towels and such in there, Xander. The top layer should fit you. Leave the door cracked so we can hear you if you get dizzy. You took a pretty hard hit to the head.\" \"Hey, hot water and I--\" Xander stood up and wobbled, but Oz had been expecting him to move too fast and got a hand under his elbow. \"Okay. Hot water and I are still friends. Standing, on the other hand.\" \"Not entirely friendly,\" Oz agreed, walking over to the bathroom door with him. He added quietly, \"I'll be out here if standing gets less friendly. Leave me some hot water.\" Xan dropped the clothes inside the bathroom, moved towels into easy reach from the shower, then stepped out. Water started running a minute later; Oz leaned against the door frame and nodded to them. He was up to this, and it gave him a better place to listen for Willow and Buffy waking up in the library. Giles rubbed his forehead. \"Right. So. Wounded taken care of--\" Alex handed him one of the same meds he'd given Xander and Oz; Giles washed it down with tea. \"Thank you.\" \"You're welcome.\" Alex caught the jeans Xan threw him, pulled them on, and sat down on the couch next to Xan. \"What can you tell us?\" \"Pretty trusting,\" Oz said mildly, one eyebrow lifting. The effect was impaired when he had to hastily brush dislodged ash out of his eyes. Huh. Hair hadn't been as clear of that fire spell as he thought. \"We're old friends, actually.\" Xan chuckled. \"At least, we were friends when we last parted.\" Giles smiled at that. \"Oz, I'd like you to meet two of my language tutors. This is Alex,\" and the pirate nodded to him, \"and that's Xan.\" The runner nodded too. \"Languages, swords, or sympathy as needed,\" Xan agreed. \"With a sideline in massage, first aid, and reasonableness.\" Alex picked up a whetstone and oil and began working on Xander's battle axe, frowning at a couple of the nicks. \"So what can you tell us? And did you get enough food, Oz?\" Giles sipped his tea and asked, \"The long version or the short version? The long version, I might add, begins with a request not to call an insane asylum.\" Oz shook his head. \"I'm good for now. Might raid for leftovers in a couple hours.\" \"Go right ahead. Leave us some of the smoked salmon, but the rest is fair game.\" Xan glanced back at Giles, shaking his head. \"Why would we call an asylum, Rupert? That green stuff in your hair wasn't iron-based blood.\" \"Ah. That. Yes.\" Giles winced a little and finally said, \"Would you believe we were preventing an apocalypse?\" Alex said calmly, \"From you, we'd believe that.\" The steady rasp of oiled chert down steel was a soothing sound to Oz, familiar from late nights prepping for vampire attacks. Oz watched, interested, as Giles actually relaxed at their acceptance. Alex went on, \"Is it averted, then?\" \"Yes, I should think so. We did horrific damage to some very old art, but given that the pigments had been mixed in a blood medium, I can't bring myself to care very much.\" Giles glanced down at the blade beside his hand -- not one they'd brought with him, one Alex had pulled off the wall and handed over. Xan had taken up Buffy's machete and was cleaning it, another set of oils and whetstones in front of him. He went straight to the practicalities, asking, \"Can anything come after you?\" Oz pointed out, \"We didn't come in by the door.\" Alex looked over the axe at him. \"Yes, but Rupert specified an apocalypse. That generally implies a supernatural element, or something sufficiently advanced to be taken for magic.\" Oz gave him an amused look. \"Yeah, we landed in the right place.\" He shrugged, still listening for a thud in the bathroom or movement across the hall in the library. Willow was going to love waking up in the middle of all those books. Oz wanted to look through a few of them later, for that matter. \"Willow teleported us out. I don't think they can follow us, but I've never seen demons like that before, either.\" Giles rubbed his forehead and took his glasses off to press fingers against the bridge of his nose. \"Unfortunately, Oz, neither had I. I really don't know if they can follow us, Alex. I should hope not, but we were expecting Chnarhl demons--\" \"That sounds more like a cough than a word,\" Xan said. He leaned over the table to scoop up the honey, squeezing more into Giles' tea without waiting for an answer. \"A word. Technically,\" Giles admitted. Alex nodded. \"So these Chnarhl demons were what you thought would be there?\" \"Yes. They're tall, strong, not all that fast, and prone to taking over old sites and praying to ugly, petty-minded little gods--\" Giles drank more of the tea; his mouth pursed with the effort not to comment on the taste. \"Yes, I know, so many of them are.\" Alex shrugged and ran a cloth over the axe to remove the extra oil, then picked up his broadsword to check it, too. \"Greek, remember? We're used to gods who bicker and fight. So what did you run into?\" Oz shrugged, careful of his ribs; they hadn't quite finished healing yet. Definitely needed to get more protein in a few hours, and more dairy, too. \"We were expecting the demon equivalent of triceratops. We kinda got velociraptors instead.\" Xan raised an eyebrow. \"Fast, vicious, and hunting in packs?\" \"And short. Scaly, winged -- bad flyers, but they had this jump-flap combination -- and the tails have a nasty saw-edge to them.\" Oz listened as the water cut off, didn't hear motion soon enough, and ducked in to catch Xander. \"Just the steam,\" Xander said tiredly, hanging on the half-open shower door. \"Gimme a sec.\" Oz nodded. \"Sure.\" He could hear Giles still briefing the two guys on what they were up against; he could also see the ruin Caleb had made of Xander's eye which meant Xander was seriously exhausted. He always kept a patch over it if anyone else was around. Xander finally let go of the door and Oz turned around to give him some privacy to get dressed, or at least the dignity of doing it without Oz seeing him wobble around from blood loss, steam inhalation, and screwed-up depth perception. Naturally, the new attack came while Xander was still pulling on his loaner sweat pants. ~ ~ ~ Xan bolted down the hall to block the other door out of the library. Alex went back into the library through the den door a lot faster than he'd left. Once they were at either end, their joined quickenings would let them both see the entire room at once. Not the easiest way to cope with a battle, but they had centuries of practice with doubled vision and doubled bodies and were used to it by now. He made it in time to see Willow's hands strobe light, throwing half a dozen short bat-winged, snake-scaled, vulture-beaked things against the shelves and away from her and Buffy. Buffy was up and blinking, shaking her head to clear it as she fell back to guard her friend's left flank with the ax she'd never let go of. Alex promptly filed her as a highly competent fighter and let her get that side; he took the other side, as Rupert slammed the den door closed behind them. \"I have this door, Alex,\" Rupert called. \"Xander, go around Xan and hold the other entry point for us.\" The glowing green eyes on the chimera-demons were a little disconcerting, like looking at absinthe after taking LSD. On the other hand, they made great targets. Alex sank his blade between the eyes, into a skull, and twisted sharply to free it quickly. He pulled the bastard sword out and up, reversing its motion into a back-thrust into another demon Xan could see coming up behind him. A third one leapt out from under the coffee table, sinking claws and tail in through denim. Xan buried his dagger in a glowing eye at the same time a sharp-edged tail sliced across one of their legs. Alex wasn't sure if it had cut him or Xan. The demon's shriek cut off when Xan yanked it toward him by the long, leathery neck while one foot on its chest shoved it back. The neck snapped when he twisted, and the wings flapped once involuntarily. Rupert called, \"Xan, down!\" and Xan dropped as one of the things leapt for his eyes with a flap of bat wings. Xan yanked his knife free as it went overhead and threw the blade -- at the demon on Alex's leg. The knife sank in to the hilt. The damn thing spasmed, claws digging in tighter, then fell away. Alex let the one in the air glide down to him and took its head off as soon as it was in range. Xan pulled another knife as he twisted to roll up again. Alex looked up from kicking another creature away from the door -- better to contain them in the one room, the den didn't have doorways to trap them -- in time to see another half-dozen of the damn things materialize around Willow with noises that matched the last series of pops. Buffy slapped two away with her ax, kicked a third towards Alex, and a very large wolf that hadn't been there earlier barreled into the other new arrivals, knocking two down and grabbing the last one by the throat and shaking it like a terrier with a rat. The creature fought back with buffeting wings and vicious tail slices until the wolf snapped its neck. From behind Alex, Rupert grunted with effort, then called, \"Willow, they seem to be homing in on you.\" Buffy snarled, kicked the breath out of a demon, brought her axe down into the spine of another, then whirled back to grab the first one. She hefted the creature over her head, too easily for her size, and slammed it down onto a friend. They both made wheezy grunts of pain and then cracking sounds. The ottoman died, too. Buffy called, \"We'll keep them off you, Willow, shut whatever this is down!\" Another six appeared, a few feet over the floor this time. The wolf spun on one hind paw, a front paw cuffing a demon to Alex like a volleyball player spiking over the net. Alex took its head off, ignoring the ichor that painted his shirt sickly green, and back-kicked another one to Xan. At this point, Alex definitely identified the tail slash as being on him, not Xan. He didn't have time to look down, but he could feel the blood starting to soak his jeans; the claw punctures hurt out of all proportion to their size, too. There was no time to do anything but take the damage into account, wish for more adrenaline to cover it up, and go on. Xan saw the wolf gathering itself to vault onto the coffee table, and Alex ducked as Oz (presumably) soared over his shoulder to haul a chimera down before it could run along a bookshelf. His left leg buckled under him, but Rupert hauled him up and back towards the doorframe. Alex pushed up against it with the leg that was still working and closed down most of his link with Xan rather than drain too much of his energy during a fight. Buffy hip-checked a low-glider towards Xan -- they really did fly slightly better than bricks despite a long lean form that should have been aerodynamic. Xan snarled an old Sacred Band profanity and sank his knife between the thing's shoulder blades. Buffy grabbed a second one by the head, popping the damn thing like a whip. She dislocated its spine with a crack that drew a faintly protesting noise from Xander. Alex glanced over at him and saw Xander was bloodied again but holding the door shut behind him and kicking the damn things back to the other fighters. Alex started slapping them back to the center with the flat of his sword, focusing on that instead of wounds that weren't closing quickly or maybe at all, or the way the room wanted to sway around him. Then Willow said, \"Oh, that's what they are.\" She sounded very matter-of-fact, as if she'd been researching them in a library with a coffee to hand instead of turning a demon's head back and forth, with her hands coated in its blood and her own eyes never quite focusing. \"And that's why we're here. Actually, this is kind of cool.\" Rupert, sounding harried, called, \"Solution now, explanation later, please, Willow.\" He grunted with the effort of pounding two new arrivals flat with a fireplace poker. Rupert was right, too; they were running out of room to fight, but moving out of the library would be a disaster. If the demons got out of here, they'd have free access to the kitchen and den, which opened onto each other, and the front entryway with the stairs up to second. These five were good fighters, but Alex wasn't sure how much house-clearing experience they had, especially against things the size and speed of whippets. Another six appeared -- why always six? -- in a circle around Willow, this time just under the ceiling. \"Oh, good point, Giles. Sorry.\" Willow still looked and sounded a little scattered from the spells or wherever she'd gone into her head or out of her body to get the information, but she looked up and the new arrivals slammed backwards into the walls and shelves, falling from there to the floor in a succession of limp thumps. She dusted her hands off like she was getting ready to start a project and said, \"Okay. Brace yourselves.\" She pulled her hands apart, an iridescent black ring appearing as she did, glowing purple and indigo at the edges, shading through blue into white at the center. The wolf whined and backed away into a corner as more of the demons started popping in -- not six at a time now but two and three dozen per burst of light and sound. They appeared, shrank, and were forced into the gleaming circle between Willow's hands. Absently, she said, \"Someone open the door behind me.\" Alex saw the bodies on the floor flying into the circle/gate, too, and turned the doorknob with one hand. He kept his back to the doorframe, broadsword ready in case one had gotten loose, and hoped that none of them had. Instead of another dinosaur-chimera-demon, ash and debris poured through the air, vanishing into the circle with the creatures. Breezes tore at Alex's hair, pulling scales and ichor away from him. A claw pulled out of his leg and Alex bit down on words he didn't want to use with magic in process, watching grimly through his eyes and Xan's as phosphorescent green venom streamed out of his wounds and towards the young witch. The same winds spun and tore around Giles and Buffy, rifled through the wolf's pelt, tugged at Xan and Xander's pants and hair. Stains vanished out of clothes, medical wrappings shot through from the kitchen trash, and blood pulled out of the carpet, all of it soaring through the air into the circle. No matter how small the circle looked comparatively, each item shrank as it approached, dropping in like pebbles falling into a whirlpool. Xander clung to the door; Xan braced him there with one arm, his spotlessly clean knife in the other, and most of his focus on Alex. Giles watched, mouth tightening into a line that used to precede a battle royale with Ethan over something. (Ethan, now there was a set of memories Alex could do without reliving.) Buffy was focused onto Willow as she said, \"Wills -- watch the magic levels.\" \"Oh, it's okay. I'm not doing most of it, Buffy. It is kinda cool though,\" Willow confided, a small fascinated smile curving her mouth despite the bruises along one side of her face. \"They're pests, but they were never supposed to get out.\" Xan's eyes narrowed at her first comments and Alex turned to look more closely at Willow, too. Xan was right; another figure faintly overlaid her, one with tan skin, waving red-gold hair several shades paler than Willow's, and a mouth dark red as-- \"Pomegranates.\" Alex let himself slide down to his good knee. Xan did the same, which brought Xander down with him. \"What the hell?\" Xander sputtered. As the last few demons appeared and promptly vanished, Xan warned him, \"Close enough. Be polite to the Lady.\" Those intangible hands closed the black gate down, gathering it from a circle into a rough-edged geode which glinted blue, purple, and green before closing into something like a rough granite globe. It hovered by Her hand, not Willow's. She was a few inches taller, which made the whole thing look even more odd. Now that it was closed, the globe looked as otherly-tangible as She did. No one laughed at either. Persephone nodded to Xan, smiled ruefully at Alex, kissed the top of Willow's head -- and vanished. Willow promptly wavered. \"Oh. Head rush. Brain freeze kind of, but I did not eat ice cream there. Or a slushee. Or anything, thanks.\" Oz moved out of his corner to catch her, both of them ignoring his nudity. Alex gave it one admiring glance and ignored it, too, as Oz settled her on the newly-clean couch. \"Here. Sit.\" Xan appeared next to Alex, voice tight as he said, \"Damn it, let me in, you idiot. Let me see that....\" Once he had a hand on Alex's shoulder, their quickenings surged together again despite Alex's best efforts and they both cursed, Alex in Phoenician, Xan in Gallic, when the pain momentarily felt twice as bad. Xan promptly sliced his jeans farther open to see how bad the wound was and if it was healing yet. \"Whoa.\" On the couch, Willow let Oz take most of her weight. \"Okay. That was completely cool and completely terrifying. I am still breathing, right?\" Buffy stared at her then said, \"Yup. Still breathing, no wiggins. Also, no black eyes or veins, but what just happened? And do I smell food? Rupert relaxed at last, sighing, \"Right, then. Round two?\" He turned to stare at Alex and Xan in time to see ladders of lightning finally start crawling along Alex's legs; the damn demons had thought he was a scratching post and Alex had a few ideas why. \"Good Lord, Alex. Are you all right?\" Xan just sighed. \"Affinities. Damn it. Not a word from you, Alex. You're sitting and drinking Gatorade and coffee until I like your color, love. He'll be fine, Rupert, and explanations after coffee, if you just have to have some.\" \"Really, I think I need both, thank you,\" Rupert said dryly. Alex sagged against Xan, trying not to keep cursing the pressure on his wound, and looked around their library. Books were scattered everywhere, the fireplace poker was going to need re-forging to be straight again, a chair had had stuffing and foam exposed, and the ottoman's legs were broken --unevenly, of course. Alex shrugged, not arguing with the call of coffee which also meant rest and until you stop worrying me/needing to draw energy to heal that. He finally said, \"Well, as usual, Rupert, your visits are never boring. Round two of food and showers it is. And calling in to work.\" \"Rupert? Someone really calls Giles that?\" Buffy looked scandalized. Rupert just rolled his eyes and went to support Xander. \"Coffee, I think, and food for those who slept through the first meal, and come to that, I should call in and let a few people know we're alive, fine, and going to be at least another day getting home ourselves.\" Oz raised one slightly shaggy eyebrow at her, sounding amused. \"At least you missed the naked guys part, Buffy.\" \"Um, Oz?\" She waved a hand towards his waist. \"So totally didn't? Oh, wait, them? Them naked? Damn! Did you get pics?\" Despite her chatter, Buffy came over and got Alex's other arm around her shoulder. She snagged his broadsword as she did and asked cheerfully, \"Can I at least have a picture after you're cleaned up? 'Cause really, I never get good souvenirs from apocalypses. It'd be nice to buck that trend.\" Alex started laughing, and Xan was half a beat behind him. Xan also waved permission and, not coincidentally, at the camera on the kitchen counter. ~ ~ ~ Oz had started layering his toast with ham, cheese, and jam, handing more slices of cheese to just about everyone in the process. \"Thanks.\" Really, he'd changed at least twice tonight; Buffy couldn't blame him for being starving. \"Yes, well, now that we're all patched up again -- are you done eating, Willow?\" Giles was sitting stiffly in his chair, face pinched in a way that told Buffy he wasn't admitting to some injury. She could tell he wasn't fooling his old friends, either. Okay, old, cute friends he'd never mentioned to the Scoobies, but Buffy already liked them for the way they'd fought earlier, the immediate offer of crash space or a library for the day, and the access to their house full of showers, refrigerator, and washer and dryer. Xan said firmly, \"You aren't patched up, Rupert. Come sit over here where I can check your ribs.\" Xander had an icepack propped against his head, which 'just happened' to be propping his head up, too. \"He's gotta point, Giles. You've looked better.\" Buffy 'helped' Giles up (he was going to get up, she just hurried it along -- by half an hour) and asked, \"I'm done, Oz is mostly done, and Wills is just rolling the eggs around now. Willow, what were those?\" \"Escapees,\" Willow said. \"They were tracking us by their blood on us.\" Alex nodded and said, \"The Lady came to collect them, so they belong in the Underworld. Every bit of them belongs there, including their blood.\" \"Right. Those thing are supposed to be guarding the Acheron.\" Willow snagged an orange, checked it carefully for something, then started peeling off rind. \"I think the Chnarhl did finish the rite, Giles -- but the rite was designed to curry favor with Hades. So they thought they were opening a hellmouth and instead they opened a gate to one of Charon's river.\" Giles winced under Xan's hands, tacitly admitting that his ribs were indeed bone-bruised and perhaps cracked. \"Yes, fine, wrap them, Xan. Yes. That would explain those river murals by the caryatids, Willow. I thought there were some decidedly Greek elements in the symbolism.\" Willow nodded. \"The color scheme makes a lot more sense if they go to the underworld, too. And we did wonder why the room for the sacrifices had that central pit and omphalos.\" Xander muttered, \"I still think phallus and omphalos sound way too much alike. What's wrong with innie and outie?\" Willow ignored him -- years of practice -- while Alex and Xan both tried not to crack completely up. Maybe it was funnier if you spoke Greek? \"Anyway,\" Willow spoke over the peanut gallery. \"The Chnarhl got to the Acheron, the guardians smelled living creatures and went after them, but then they couldn't get home. And then we showed up.\" Oz said thoughtfully, \"Kinda confused here. How'd we end up here instead of Oxford?\" Xander looked up, \"You never said where 'here' is, either.\" Xan grinned at him. \"No one asked, Xander. You're in Sacramento. California?\" Xander shook his head, figured out that hurt, and stopped. \"England to Central America and we land back in California?\" Oz shrugged, glanced at Alex and said, \"Watch for sinkholes. So why were you the only one who got poisoned? Not that we wanted to be in line, but.\" \"And what's with the whole Frahnkenshteen healing?\" Xander added. \"That's Frankenstein,\" Alex pointed out, deadpan. He shrugged, shifting over to a command voice that reminded Buffy of Giles finally laying down the law about something. \"We haven't asked why you're running around handling apocalypses--\" \"--and know the proper plural,\" Xan added, still wrapping Giles' ribs. \"--and you don't get answers on that one. We're no threat to you. That'll have to do.\" Alex's tone said he was absolutely not at home to questions on that. Giles glanced at him, at Xan, and then left it alone. Buffy gave them both the stink-eye over her coffee, but nope, no wiggins there either. Huh. Okay. Something was weird there, but Giles wasn't worried and hey, demons didn't like them, so whatever it clearly wasn't nearly as important as celebrating the win. Xander muttered, \"Great, another officer,\" but he was already nodding too. Huh. Kinda interesting. \"Okay. Fine. Because yeah, not so much with the explaining here either.\" Xan said patiently, \"And we haven't asked you to.\" Willow snagged the last of the coffee and ignored Xander's pitiful expression by concentrating on how much whipped cream she could fit into the mug. One quarter coffee, three quarters whipped cream looked about right to Buffy, too. Oz smiled a little and stole a fingerful of it, to Willow's laughing protests. \"Mine, Oz,\" Willow insisted. \"And Alex worships Hades, so their blood side-tracked us here, or maybe Persephone did. Once the guardians revived from us killing them--\" Buffy looked up, offended. \"I thought I'd killed that snaggle-toothed one already!\" Willow shushed her and went on, \"They're from the realms of the dead, Buffy, and they weren't really alive, so they weren't great at staying dead either. Death demons, ech. But She did show up to help collect them, once I figured out what was going on to ask Her. Actually, She was pretty nice.\" Xander gave Willow a very offended and kinda worried look. (Buffy was going to sidetrack that interest later, too. So was Giles from the extra wrinkles between his eyes.) Then Xander turned to glare at Alex, too. \"Seriously, you worship a death god?\" Alex glanced up at Xander, sounding remarkably calm for being presented with Xander-logic. \"He's also known as the Even-Handed One, the Great Leveler, and the Final Justice.\" Xan finished helping Giles back into his shirt and added, \"And unlike the rest of the Greek gods, Hades is happily married and has been for centuries. Alex worships Apollo too, if that makes you feel any better?\" \"This is explaining so much,\" Giles muttered, but he was really trying not to smile. Buffy knew that particular 'frown;' it usually preceded her getting a new pair of shoes on the Watcher account, or at least a really frothy, loaded mochachino. \"And you, Xan?\" Xan grinned at him. \"Oh I mostly worship Poseidon and Eros. Useful, too, since we frequently live in earthquake country.\" \"So, Alex and the poison?\" Oz asked patiently, coming back around to his earlier point. He could get stubborn like that. \"My best guess?\" Alex asked ruefully. \"Haven't you ever noticed that cats like to claw familiar things?\" Xander looked at both of them, opened his mouth -- then winced and shut up again. Buffy nodded happily. Slayer aim: one thousand plus, Xander shin: zero. She sat up and said brightly, \"Right. You've called in, we've called in, the demons are dead or gone, and Willow needs to recharge before she can teleport us home. So.\" She batted her eyelashes at them shamelessly. (Dawn would have laughed her out of the kitchen, but Dawn wasn't there.) \"About these naked pictures I was promised? The really important question is: who gets to set the poses?\" \"Buffy!\" Yeah. Alex, Xan, and Willow were laughing harder than Giles was fussing, Xander didn't want a dent in his other shin, and Oz had been laidback about nekkid even before he became a werewolf. Needing a new manicure was nothing on pictures of a pair of hot Greek guys in (hopefully not) classical poses. Totally a win/win day. ~~~ finis ~~~",

      "\"So what can you tell us?",
      "And did you get enough food, Oz?\" Giles sipped his tea and asked, \"The long version or the short version?",
      "The long version, I might add, begins with a request not to call an insane asylum.\"",
      "Oz shook his head.",
      "\"I'm good for now.",
      "Might raid for leftovers in a couple hours.\"",
      "\"Go right ahead.",
      "Leave us some of the smoked salmon, but the rest is fair game.\"",
      "Xan glanced back at Giles, shaking his head.",
      "\"Why would we call an asylum, Rupert?",
      "That green stuff in your hair wasn't iron-based blood.\"",
      "\"Ah.",
      "That.",
      "Yes.\"",
      "Giles winced a little and finally said, \"Would you believe we were preventing an apocalypse?\" Alex said calmly, \"From you, we'd believe that.\"",
      "The steady rasp of oiled chert down steel was a soothing sound to Oz, familiar from late nights prepping for vampire attacks.",
      "Oz watched, interested, as Giles actually relaxed at their acceptance.",
      "Alex went on, \"Is it averted, then?\"",
      "\"Yes, I should think so.",
      "We did horrific damage to some very old art, but given that the pigments had been mixed in a blood medium, I can't bring myself to care very much.\"",
      "Giles glanced down at the blade beside his hand -- not one they'd brought with him, one Alex had pulled off the wall and handed over.",
      "Xan had taken up Buffy's machete and was cleaning it, another set of oils and whetstones in front of him.",
      "He went straight to the practicalities, asking, \"Can anything come after you?\" Oz pointed out, \"We didn't come in by the door.\"",
      "Alex looked over the axe at him.",
      "\"Yes, but Rupert specified an apocalypse.",
      "That generally implies a supernatural element, or something sufficiently advanced to be taken for magic.\"",
      "Oz gave him an amused look.",
      "\"Yeah, we landed in the right place.\"",
      "He shrugged, still listening for a thud in the bathroom or movement across the hall in the library.",
      "Willow was going to love waking up in the middle of all those books.",
      "Oz wanted to look through a few of them later, for that matter.",
      "\"Willow teleported us out.",
      "I don't think they can follow us, but I've never seen demons like that before, either.\"",
      "Giles rubbed his forehead and took his glasses off to press fingers against the bridge of his nose.",
      "\"Unfortunately, Oz, neither had I. I really don't know if they can follow us, Alex. I should hope not, but we were expecting Chnarhl demons--\" \"That sounds more like a cough than a word,\" Xan said.",
      "He leaned over the table to scoop up the honey, squeezing more into Giles' tea without waiting for an answer.",
      "\"A word.",
      "Technically,\" Giles admitted.",
      "Alex nodded.",
      "\"So these Chnarhl demons were what you thought would be there?\"",
      "\"Yes.",
      "They're tall, strong, not all that fast, and prone to taking over old sites and praying to ugly, petty-minded little gods--\" Giles drank more of the tea; his mouth pursed with the effort not to comment on the taste.",
      "\"Yes, I know, so many of them are.\"",
      "Alex shrugged and ran a cloth over the axe to remove the extra oil, then picked up his broadsword to check it, too.",
      "\"Greek, remember?",
      "We're used to gods who bicker and fight.",
      "So what did you run into?\" Oz shrugged, careful of his ribs; they hadn't quite finished healing yet.",
      "Definitely needed to get more protein in a few hours, and more dairy, too.",
      "\"We were expecting the demon equivalent of triceratops.",
      "We kinda got velociraptors instead.\"",
      "Xan raised an eyebrow.",
      "\"Fast, vicious, and hunting in packs?\"",
      "\"And short.",
      "Scaly, winged -- bad flyers, but they had this jump-flap combination -- and the tails have a nasty saw-edge to them.\"",
      "Oz listened as the water cut off, didn't hear motion soon enough, and ducked in to catch Xander.",
      "\"Just the steam,\" Xander said tiredly, hanging on the half-open shower door.",
      "\"Gimme a sec.\"",
      "Oz nodded.",
      "\"Sure.\"",
      "He could hear Giles still briefing the two guys on what they were up against; he could also see the ruin Caleb had made of Xander's eye which meant Xander was seriously exhausted.",
      "He always kept a patch over it if anyone else was around.",
      "Xander finally let go of the door and Oz turned around to give him some privacy to get dressed, or at least the dignity of doing it without Oz seeing him wobble around from blood loss, steam inhalation, and screwed-up depth perception.",
      "Naturally, the new attack came while Xander was still pulling on his loaner sweat pants.",
      "~ ~ ~ Xan bolted down the hall to block the other door out of the library.",
      "Alex went back into the library through the den door a lot faster than he'd left.",
      "Once they were at either end, their joined quickenings would let them both see the entire room at once.",
      "Not the easiest way to cope with a battle, but they had centuries of practice with doubled vision and doubled bodies and were used to it by now.",
      "He made it in time to see Willow's hands strobe light, throwing half a dozen short bat-winged, snake-scaled, vulture-beaked things against the shelves and away from her and Buffy.",
      "Buffy was up and blinking, shaking her head to clear it as she fell back to guard her friend's left flank with the ax she'd never let go of.",
      "Alex promptly filed her as a highly competent fighter and let her get that side; he took the other side, as Rupert slammed the den door closed behind them.",
      "\"I have this door, Alex,\" Rupert called.",
      "\"Xander, go around Xan and hold the other entry point for us.\"",
      "The glowing green eyes on the chimera-demons were a little disconcerting, like looking at absinthe after taking LSD.",
      "On the other hand, they made great targets.",
      "Alex sank his blade between the eyes, into a skull, and twisted sharply to free it quickly.",
      "He pulled the bastard sword out and up, reversing its motion into a back-thrust into another demon Xan could see coming up behind him.",
      "A third one leapt out from under the coffee table, sinking claws and tail in through denim.",
      "Xan buried his dagger in a glowing eye at the same time a sharp-edged tail sliced across one of their legs.",
      "Alex wasn't sure if it had cut him or Xan.",
      "The demon's shriek cut off when Xan yanked it toward him by the long, leathery neck while one foot on its chest shoved it back.",
      "The neck snapped when he twisted, and the wings flapped once involuntarily.",
      "Rupert called, \"Xan, down!\"",
      "and Xan dropped as one of the things leapt for his eyes with a flap of bat wings.",
      "Xan yanked his knife free as it went overhead and threw the blade -- at the demon on Alex's leg.",
      "The knife sank in to the hilt.",
      "The damn thing spasmed, claws digging in tighter, then fell away.",
      "Alex let the one in the air glide down to him and took its head off as soon as it was in range.",
      "Xan pulled another knife as he twisted to roll up again.",
      "Alex looked up from kicking another creature away from the door -- better to contain them in the one room, the den didn't have doorways to trap them -- in time to see another half-dozen of the damn things materialize around Willow with noises that matched the last series of pops.",
      "Buffy slapped two away with her ax, kicked a third towards Alex, and a very large wolf that hadn't been there earlier barreled into the other new arrivals, knocking two down and grabbing the last one by the throat and shaking it like a terrier with a rat.",
      "The creature fought back with buffeting wings and vicious tail slices until the wolf snapped its neck.",
      "From behind Alex, Rupert grunted with effort, then called, \"Willow, they seem to be homing in on you.\"",
      "Buffy snarled, kicked the breath out of a demon, brought her axe down into the spine of another, then whirled back to grab the first one.",
      "She hefted the creature over her head, too easily for her size, and slammed it down onto a friend.",
      "They both made wheezy grunts of pain and then cracking sounds.",
      "The ottoman died, too.",
      "Buffy called, \"We'll keep them off you, Willow, shut whatever this is down!\"",
      "Another six appeared, a few feet over the floor this time.",
      "The wolf spun on one hind paw, a front paw cuffing a demon to Alex like a volleyball player spiking over the net.",
      "Alex took its head off, ignoring the ichor that painted his shirt sickly green, and back-kicked another one to Xan.",
      "At this point, Alex definitely identified the tail slash as being on him, not Xan.",
      "He didn't have time to look down, but he could feel the blood starting to soak his jeans; the claw punctures hurt out of all proportion to their size, too.",
      "There was no time to do anything but take the damage into account, wish for more adrenaline to cover it up, and go on.",
      "Xan saw the wolf gathering itself to vault onto the coffee table, and Alex ducked as Oz (presumably) soared over his shoulder to haul a chimera down before it could run along a bookshelf.",
      "His left leg buckled under him, but Rupert hauled him up and back towards the doorframe.",
      "Alex pushed up against it with the leg that was still working and closed down most of his link with Xan rather than drain too much of his energy during a fight.",
      "Buffy hip-checked a low-glider towards Xan -- they really did fly slightly better than bricks despite a long lean form that should have been aerodynamic.",
      "Xan snarled an old Sacred Band profanity and sank his knife between the thing's shoulder blades.",
      "Buffy grabbed a second one by the head, popping the damn thing like a whip.",
      "She dislocated its spine with a crack that drew a faintly protesting noise from Xander.",
      "Alex glanced over at him and saw Xander was bloodied again but holding the door shut behind him and kicking the damn things back to the other fighters.",
      "Alex started slapping them back to the center with the flat of his sword, focusing on that instead of wounds that weren't closing quickly or maybe at all, or the way the room wanted to sway around him.",
      "Then Willow said, \"Oh, that's what they are.\"",
      "She sounded very matter-of-fact, as if she'd been researching them in a library with a coffee to hand instead of turning a demon's head back and forth, with her hands coated in its blood and her own eyes never quite focusing.",
      "\"And that's why we're here.",
      "Actually, this is kind of cool.\"",
      "Rupert, sounding harried, called, \"Solution now, explanation later, please, Willow.\"",
      "He grunted with the effort of pounding two new arrivals flat with a fireplace poker.",
      "Rupert was right, too; they were running out of room to fight, but moving out of the library would be a disaster.",
      "If the demons got out of here, they'd have free access to the kitchen and den, which opened onto each other, and the front entryway with the stairs up to second.",
      "These five were good fighters, but Alex wasn't sure how much house-clearing experience they had, especially against things the size and speed of whippets.",
      "Another six appeared -- why always six?",
      "-- in a circle around Willow, this time just under the ceiling.",
      "\"Oh, good point, Giles.",
      "Sorry.\"",
      "Willow still looked and sounded a little scattered from the spells or wherever she'd gone into her head or out of her body to get the information, but she looked up and the new arrivals slammed backwards into the walls and shelves, falling from there to the floor in a succession of limp thumps.",
      "She dusted her hands off like she was getting ready to start a project and said, \"Okay.",
      "Brace yourselves.\"",
      "She pulled her hands apart, an iridescent black ring appearing as she did, glowing purple and indigo at the edges, shading through blue into white at the center.",
      "The wolf whined and backed away into a corner as more of the demons started popping in -- not six at a time now but two and three dozen per burst of light and sound.",
      "They appeared, shrank, and were forced into the gleaming circle between Willow's hands.",
      "Absently, she said, \"Someone open the door behind me.\"",
      "Alex saw the bodies on the floor flying into the circle/gate, too, and turned the doorknob with one hand.",
      "He kept his back to the doorframe, broadsword ready in case one had gotten loose, and hoped that none of them had.",
      "Instead of another dinosaur-chimera-demon, ash and debris poured through the air, vanishing into the circle with the creatures.",
      "Breezes tore at Alex's hair, pulling scales and ichor away from him.",
      "A claw pulled out of his leg and Alex bit down on words he didn't want to use with magic in process, watching grimly through his eyes and Xan's as phosphorescent green venom streamed out of his wounds and towards the young witch.",
      "The same winds spun and tore around Giles and Buffy, rifled through the wolf's pelt, tugged at Xan and Xander's pants and hair.",
      "Stains vanished out of clothes, medical wrappings shot through from the kitchen trash, and blood pulled out of the carpet, all of it soaring through the air into the circle.",
      "No matter how small the circle looked comparatively, each item shrank as it approached, dropping in like pebbles falling into a whirlpool.",
      "Xander clung to the door; Xan braced him there with one arm, his spotlessly clean knife in the other, and most of his focus on Alex. Giles watched, mouth tightening into a line that used to precede a battle royale with Ethan over something.",
      "(Ethan, now there was a set of memories Alex could do without reliving.)",
      "Buffy was focused onto Willow as she said, \"Wills -- watch the magic levels.\"",
      "\"Oh, it's okay.",
      "I'm not doing most of it, Buffy.",
      "It is kinda cool though,\" Willow confided, a small fascinated smile curving her mouth despite the bruises along one side of her face.",
      "\"They're pests, but they were never supposed to get out.\"",
      "Xan's eyes narrowed at her first comments and Alex turned to look more closely at Willow, too.",
      "Xan was right; another figure faintly overlaid her, one with tan skin, waving red-gold hair several shades paler than Willow's, and a mouth dark red as-- \"Pomegranates.\"",
      "Alex let himself slide down to his good knee.",
      "Xan did the same, which brought Xander down with him.",
      "\"What the hell?\" Xander sputtered.",
      "As the last few demons appeared and promptly vanished, Xan warned him, \"Close enough.",
      "Be polite to the Lady.\"",
      "Those intangible hands closed the black gate down, gathering it from a circle into a rough-edged geode which glinted blue, purple, and green before closing into something like a rough granite globe.",
      "It hovered by Her hand, not Willow's.",
      "She was a few inches taller, which made the whole thing look even more odd.",
      "Now that it was closed, the globe looked as otherly-tangible as She did.",
      "No one laughed at either.",
      "Persephone nodded to Xan, smiled ruefully at Alex, kissed the top of Willow's head -- and vanished.",
      "Willow promptly wavered.",
      "\"Oh.",
      "Head rush.",
      "Brain freeze kind of, but I did not eat ice cream there.",
      "Or a slushee.",
      "Or anything, thanks.\"",
      "Oz moved out of his corner to catch her, both of them ignoring his nudity.",
      "Alex gave it one admiring glance and ignored it, too, as Oz settled her on the newly-clean couch.",
      "\"Here.",
      "Sit.\"",
      "Xan appeared next to Alex, voice tight as he said, \"Damn it, let me in, you idiot.",
      "Let me see that....\" Once he had a hand on Alex's shoulder, their quickenings surged together again despite Alex's best efforts and they both cursed, Alex in Phoenician, Xan in Gallic, when the pain momentarily felt twice as bad.",
      "Xan promptly sliced his jeans farther open to see how bad the wound was and if it was healing yet.",
      "\"Whoa.\"",
      "On the couch, Willow let Oz take most of her weight.",
      "\"Okay.",
      "That was completely cool and completely terrifying.",
      "I am still breathing, right?\" Buffy stared at her then said, \"Yup.",
      "Still breathing, no wiggins.",
      "Also, no black eyes or veins, but what just happened?",
      "And do I smell food?",
      "Rupert relaxed at last, sighing, \"Right, then.",
      "Round two?\"",
      "He turned to stare at Alex and Xan in time to see ladders of lightning finally start crawling along Alex's legs; the damn demons had thought he was a scratching post and Alex had a few ideas why.",
      "\"Good Lord, Alex. Are you all right?\" Xan just sighed.",
      "\"Affinities.",
      "Damn it.",
      "Not a word from you, Alex. You're sitting and drinking Gatorade and coffee until I like your color, love.",
      "He'll be fine, Rupert, and explanations after coffee, if you just have to have some.\"",
      "\"Really, I think I need both, thank you,\" Rupert said dryly.",
      "Alex sagged against Xan, trying not to keep cursing the pressure on his wound, and looked around their library.",
      "Books were scattered everywhere, the fireplace poker was going to need re-forging to be straight again, a chair had had stuffing and foam exposed, and the ottoman's legs were broken --unevenly, of course.",
      "Alex shrugged, not arguing with the call of coffee which also meant rest and until you stop worrying me/needing to draw energy to heal that.",
      "He finally said, \"Well, as usual, Rupert, your visits are never boring.",
      "Round two of food and showers it is.",
      "And calling in to work.\"",
      "\"Rupert?",
      "Someone really calls Giles that?\" Buffy looked scandalized.",
      "Rupert just rolled his eyes and went to support Xander.",
      "\"Coffee, I think, and food for those who slept through the first meal, and come to that, I should call in and let a few people know we're alive, fine, and going to be at least another day getting home ourselves.\"",
      "Oz raised one slightly shaggy eyebrow at her, sounding amused.",
      "\"At least you missed the naked guys part, Buffy.\"",
      "\"Um, Oz?\"",
      "She waved a hand towards his waist.",
      "\"So totally didn't?",
      "Oh, wait, them?",
      "Them naked?",
      "Damn!",
      "Did you get pics?\"",
      "Despite her chatter, Buffy came over and got Alex's other arm around her shoulder.",
      "She snagged his broadsword as she did and asked cheerfully, \"Can I at least have a picture after you're cleaned up?",
      "'Cause really, I never get good souvenirs from apocalypses.",
      "It'd be nice to buck that trend.\"",
      "Alex started laughing, and Xan was half a beat behind him.",
      "Xan also waved permission and, not coincidentally, at the camera on the kitchen counter.",
      "~ ~ ~ Oz had started layering his toast with ham, cheese, and jam, handing more slices of cheese to just about everyone in the process.",
      "\"Thanks.\"",
      "Really, he'd changed at least twice tonight; Buffy couldn't blame him for being starving.",
      "\"Yes, well, now that we're all patched up again -- are you done eating, Willow?\" Giles was sitting stiffly in his chair, face pinched in a way that told Buffy he wasn't admitting to some injury.",
      "She could tell he wasn't fooling his old friends, either.",
      "Okay, old, cute friends he'd never mentioned to the Scoobies, but Buffy already liked them for the way they'd fought earlier, the immediate offer of crash space or a library for the day, and the access to their house full of showers, refrigerator, and washer and dryer.",
      "Xan said firmly, \"You aren't patched up, Rupert.",
      "Come sit over here where I can check your ribs.\"",
      "Xander had an icepack propped against his head, which 'just happened' to be propping his head up, too.",
      "\"He's gotta point, Giles.",
      "You've looked better.\"",
      "Buffy 'helped' Giles up (he was going to get up, she just hurried it along -- by half an hour) and asked, \"I'm done, Oz is mostly done, and Wills is just rolling the eggs around now.",
      "Willow, what were those?\" \"Escapees,\" Willow said.",
      "\"They were tracking us by their blood on us.\"",
      "Alex nodded and said, \"The Lady came to collect them, so they belong in the Underworld.",
      "Every bit of them belongs there, including their blood.\"",
      "\"Right.",
      "Those thing are supposed to be guarding the Acheron.\"",
      "Willow snagged an orange, checked it carefully for something, then started peeling off rind.",
      "\"I think the Chnarhl did finish the rite, Giles -- but the rite was designed to curry favor with Hades.",
      "So they thought they were opening a hellmouth and instead they opened a gate to one of Charon's river.\"",
      "Giles winced under Xan's hands, tacitly admitting that his ribs were indeed bone-bruised and perhaps cracked.",
      "\"Yes, fine, wrap them, Xan.",
      "Yes.",
      "That would explain those river murals by the caryatids, Willow.",
      "I thought there were some decidedly Greek elements in the symbolism.\"",
      "Willow nodded.",
      "\"The color scheme makes a lot more sense if they go to the underworld, too.",
      "And we did wonder why the room for the sacrifices had that central pit and omphalos.\"",
      "Xander muttered, \"I still think phallus and omphalos sound way too much alike.",
      "What's wrong with innie and outie?\"",
      "Willow ignored him -- years of practice -- while Alex and Xan both tried not to crack completely up.",
      "Maybe it was funnier if you spoke Greek?",
      "\"Anyway,\" Willow spoke over the peanut gallery.",
      "\"The Chnarhl got to the Acheron, the guardians smelled living creatures and went after them, but then they couldn't get home.",
      "And then we showed up.\"",
      "Oz said thoughtfully, \"Kinda confused here.",
      "How'd we end up here instead of Oxford?\"",
      "Xander looked up, \"You never said where 'here' is, either.\"",
      "Xan grinned at him.",
      "\"No one asked, Xander.",
      "You're in Sacramento.",
      "California?\"",
      "Xander shook his head, figured out that hurt, and stopped.",
      "\"England to Central America and we land back in California?\" Oz shrugged, glanced at Alex and said, \"Watch for sinkholes.",
      "So why were you the only one who got poisoned?",
      "Not that we wanted to be in line, but.\"",
      "\"And what's with the whole Frahnkenshteen healing?\" Xander added.",
      "\"That's Frankenstein,\" Alex pointed out, deadpan.",
      "He shrugged, shifting over to a command voice that reminded Buffy of Giles finally laying down the law about something.",
      "\"We haven't asked why you're running around handling apocalypses--\" \"--and know the proper plural,\" Xan added, still wrapping Giles' ribs.",
      "\"--and you don't get answers on that one.",
      "We're no threat to you.",
      "That'll have to do.\"",
      "Alex's tone said he was absolutely not at home to questions on that.",
      "Giles glanced at him, at Xan, and then left it alone.",
      "Buffy gave them both the stink-eye over her coffee, but nope, no wiggins there either.",
      "Huh.",
      "Okay.",
      "Something was weird there, but Giles wasn't worried and hey, demons didn't like them, so whatever it clearly wasn't nearly as important as celebrating the win.",
      "Xander muttered, \"Great, another officer,\" but he was already nodding too.",
      "Huh.",
      "Kinda interesting.",
      "\"Okay.",
      "Fine.",
      "Because yeah, not so much with the explaining here either.\"",
      "Xan said patiently, \"And we haven't asked you to.\"",
      "Willow snagged the last of the coffee and ignored Xander's pitiful expression by concentrating on how much whipped cream she could fit into the mug.",
      "One quarter coffee, three quarters whipped cream looked about right to Buffy, too.",
      "Oz smiled a little and stole a fingerful of it, to Willow's laughing protests.",
      "\"Mine, Oz,\" Willow insisted.",
      "\"And Alex worships Hades, so their blood side-tracked us here, or maybe Persephone did.",
      "Once the guardians revived from us killing them--\" Buffy looked up, offended.",
      "\"I thought I'd killed that snaggle-toothed one already!\"",
      "Willow shushed her and went on, \"They're from the realms of the dead, Buffy, and they weren't really alive, so they weren't great at staying dead either.",
      "Death demons, ech.",
      "But She did show up to help collect them, once I figured out what was going on to ask Her.",
      "Actually, She was pretty nice.\"",
      "Xander gave Willow a very offended and kinda worried look.",
      "(Buffy was going to sidetrack that interest later, too.",
      "So was Giles from the extra wrinkles between his eyes.)",
      "Then Xander turned to glare at Alex, too.",
      "\"Seriously, you worship a death god?\" Alex glanced up at Xander, sounding remarkably calm for being presented with Xander-logic.",
      "\"He's also known as the Even-Handed One, the Great Leveler, and the Final Justice.\"",
      "Xan finished helping Giles back into his shirt and added, \"And unlike the rest of the Greek gods, Hades is happily married and has been for centuries.",
      "Alex worships Apollo too, if that makes you feel any better?\"",
      "\"This is explaining so much,\" Giles muttered, but he was really trying not to smile.",
      "Buffy knew that particular 'frown;' it usually preceded her getting a new pair of shoes on the Watcher account, or at least a really frothy, loaded mochachino.",
      "\"And you, Xan?\" Xan grinned at him.",
      "\"Oh I mostly worship Poseidon and Eros. Useful, too, since we frequently live in earthquake country.\"",
      "\"So, Alex and the poison?\" Oz asked patiently, coming back around to his earlier point.",
      "He could get stubborn like that.",
      "\"My best guess?\" Alex asked ruefully.",
      "\"Haven't you ever noticed that cats like to claw familiar things?\"",
      "Xander looked at both of them, opened his mouth -- then winced and shut up again.",
      "Buffy nodded happily.",
      "Slayer aim: one thousand plus, Xander shin: zero.",
      "She sat up and said brightly, \"Right.",
      "You've called in, we've called in, the demons are dead or gone, and Willow needs to recharge before she can teleport us home.",
      "So.\"",
      "She batted her eyelashes at them shamelessly.",
      "(Dawn would have laughed her out of the kitchen, but Dawn wasn't there.)",
      "\"About these naked pictures I was promised?",
      "The really important question is: who gets to set the poses?\" \"Buffy!\"",
      "Yeah.",
      "Alex, Xan, and Willow were laughing harder than Giles was fussing, Xander didn't want a dent in his other shin, and Oz had been laidback about nekkid even before he became a werewolf.",
      "Needing a new manicure was nothing on pictures of a pair of hot Greek guys in (hopefully not) classical poses.",
      "Totally a win/win day.",
      "~~~ finis ~~~"

    "text": "Eurydice's intended is singing. Orpheus' voice rises, wordless and hoarse and undeniable above the music of the orgy, the tumult of whispers and lip-smacks, moans and cries, and no matter how he pants and groans Pyrros can't help but hear him. Eurydice sings joyously in return even as Pyrros has her, lilting her every moan in counterpoint to Orpheus' song, as if they held hands from the separate ends of the meadow, as it were Orpheus she lay with now rather than Pyrros who plunges within her. Gritting his teeth, he redoubles his pace, rutting her delicate flesh as hard as he dares; Eurydice's song soars to a piercing shriek, her strong fingers tighten around his horns and her slender thighs around his ribs a heartbeat before she clutches slickly tight around him in flutters of delirious pleasure. At last, at last, her wildfire kindles his, and he bellows in ecstasy as he shudders into her, as she laughs breathlessly into his neck and for just one moment they drown out Orpheus' song. But then she hums again, sweetly melodious, and even as Pyrros collapses in fulfillment, his face into her scented hair and his phallos still snug within her, a pang pulses in his heart. As soon as he can he pushes his arm beneath him, propping himself like a tremor-shaken wall to balm his heart with her disheveled beauty. She lies smiling beneath his regard, her gauzy eyelids veiling her huge round eyes, her long lashes trembling on her flushed cheeks, her parted lips rosy as blossoms. Her hair is a spill of night-dark silk around her shapely face, the beads which had dressed it now scattered among the strands like stars; her throat is long and sleek beneath his awe-gentled fingers, her nipples perked and pink as her lips, and when he cups her tender breast in his hand she strokes his ear and shows her glinting teeth. Her fine dancing dress lies undone around them, the seven-flounced skirt and the sleeved bodice cushioning her back from the grassy earth as she lies almost mother-naked in Pyrros' arms, looking almost as wild as he. He brushes his smiling lips over hers, and she nips his lip gently before kissing him in return. Pyrros lifts his head to feast his eyes again, his phallos already twitching towards another readiness, for he is young and has the woman of his desire. But Eurydice laughs and pushes at his side, teasing, \"Oh eager lamb!\", scratching her fingertips through his pelt as she squirms to be released. With one hand he could hold her fast, but --- Orpheus approaches, his voice heralding him as he picks his way amongst the writhing revellers, and Eurydice opens her green eyes, looking to him. Orpheus arrives laughing and naked, covered with pink bites from maenads' teeth, bending to offer his lady his hand, and with a shift of his hips Pyrros lets her slip from beneath him. Orpheus ruffles the fur between his horns as she stands, and as Pyrros looks up at them together, at Eurydice smiling and tender-skinned leaning on Orpheus' arm, the pang in his heart smarts sorely. It is Eros' cruel arrow, buried in him since the moment he first laid eyes on her laughing at Orpheus' side, and no matter how he has enjoyed her amidst today's festival Pyrros knows that Orpheus will have her to wife, that he can never quench this pain.",

They lived in peace with ordinary humans, and though there were those who enforced the law, for the most part they were unnecessary. Of course, not everyone respected the peace, but they were dealt with, swiftly. It was commonplace for humans to be chosen as precious ones to the wolves, and they and their families were protected. Anyone who violated this trust was also dealt with. Lady Lydia of Martin was one such human. There are tales woven about the otherworldly beauty possessed by those who are not quite mortal, but Lady Lydia outshone them all. Chosen at a young age to be a handmaiden to the Hale Alpha-in-waiting, Laura, she was cherished by her mistress and enjoyed her life with them. Lady Lydia knew she was beautiful, but also knew her place in the Hale household was dependant on the whims of Laura, and that kept her somewhat humble. Looking back, it was just an ordinary, warm-weather day when Laura took her handmaidens and ladies-in-waiting out to her favorite meadow to enjoy the sunshine that was the beginning of the end. Some of the other woodland creatures had even come out to join them as they basked and frolicked and had a good time. It was in a moment of downtime that Lydia noticed a sprig of aconite growing in the meadow. Aconite, or as it was more commonly known, wolfsbane, was poisonous to all wolf-kind and therefore forbidden to grow on Hale lands. Lydia went over to the wolfsbane--intending to pull it from its roots and burn it, but the fates had another plan in mind. Wolfsbane was a plant so poisonous that its roots reached down far deeper than Lydia expected: the Underworld, where the banished ones resided. Unfortunately, Lady Lydia's beauty was also so great that it pierced the veil into the Underworld, reaching the eyes of Peter Hale, the leader of the banished creatures that lived there. Peter Hale, who was--yes--an uncle of Laura Hale, had been banished to the Underworld so long ago that most didn't even remember the reason why anymore. He was a cold man who cared for nothing and no one but himself, but when he saw Lady Lydia's visage through the hole left by the roots of the wolfsbane plant, something stirred within his heart. For the first time in a very long time, Peter Hale felt love, and he knew that that woman must be his. He saddled his chariot with creatures of shadow and rode to the surface. Lydia had no warning to Peter's arrival; the earth beneath her feet split open without a sound, and Peter had her in his arms and in his chariot before she could even scream. The ground resealed above her, swallowing any resulting noise as they disappeared. It all happened so fast that no one witnessed her abduction; the only evidence she had been there was the wolfsbane flower now lying abandoned on the ground.",

She thinks that that's rubbish: she feels so cold whenever one of them touches her skin that she can't imagine she looks anything but sickly. He gives her robes made of water that never wet her skin and always stay in perfect condition. They flow around her body and along her curves, constantly moving. Whenever he forces her to wear then, she can never be sure which parts of her body are covered at the moment. Goosebumps pop up on her skin and shivers run down her spine. He gives her pets to play around with. The moths only remind her of butterflies and the good times she was swept away from. The cockroaches repulse her, because even though they are strong, seemingly respectable animals, she feels dirty around them. But the lost, sinful souls are the worst. He's made a little zoo for them, not far away from where she sleeps. Whenever she forget they're there and wanders down the path that for the life of her she couldn't distinguish from other paths, she comes back screaming. That is the only time when she will allow herself to think of grasses swaying in the breeze, of her mother running laughing through a field and watching flowers sprout from the ground wherever her feet land.

He needs to be saved, and better yet, he wants to be saved, though he never says it. He relies on a thin, unworldly woman to lead him to a better place.

His curse is the greatest one of them all, and she wonders what in the world he did to deserve it. Fin",

    "text": "It is approaching dusk when Hera comes upon the caravan. A long procession of people and wagons and horses, dotted with little spots of light. Lanterns, Hera realises as she walks closer. The leader calls for them to halt and camp is swiftly assembled. They build a bonfire and settle around it to eat and share tales. She comes then, into the firelight and tells her story of a woman with an unfaithful husband and children who she fears will never forgive her. The elderly woman beside her pulls Hera into her ancient arms, lets her cry as she strokes her hair. And just like that she becomes one of their own. They are refugees fleeing from war, women and children and men who have lost husbands and fathers, sons and brothers. They have left behind their homes and all they know but they are alive and grateful and they sing and dance and laugh and Hera laughs with them. They travel south, stopping along the way to take odd jobs or sell wood carvings and needlework. By the time they reach the southern ports there is enough money to buy everyone passage on a merchant ship to Troy. Hera wishes she could blanket them in blessings and protective charms but she does not want Poseidon to find her, she has done well evading the gods thus far. She watches over them instead, pacing the deck well past the midnight hour. She sits with Agapios the caravan leader who also refuses to sleep. \"I made a promise to look after my people and I will not break it.\" He tells her. They talk about politics and war and the men who play those violent games. \"My son,\" she says, \"is a warrior.\" He is surprised, eyes wide, mouth hanging open and she laughs when he stutters his apology. \"You do not look like a woman with a son old enough to fight in wars.\" \"You do not look like a man who fights in wars.\" And he doesn't. Agapios is tall, much taller than Hera, but where Ares is muscular and battle hardened, he is soft lines and lanky limbs. Agapios, Hera decides, must have been a scholar. He smiles when she tells him. \"A very poor one,\" he says. He asks Hera about her life before the caravan and when she is reluctant to share, divulges a secret of his own. \"I killed a man.\" He says, staring into the moonlit sea. \"A soldier, he charged at me and I stabbed him.\" He takes a deep breath to calm himself but his hands are shaking. \"A man who might have had a family, a wife and sons waiting for him.\" Agapios drops to his knees gasping for air, reaching out blindly. Hera grabs his hands and kneels beside him, she runs a soothing palm over his brow and waits for him to calm. \"Are you sorry?\" she asks, \"Do you feel remorse for what you did?\" He nods weakly. Hera smiles at him and gives his hand a comforting squeeze. \"Then I'm sure you will be forgiven.\" They sit in silence until the sun rises. The rest of the ship rouses slowly and eventually Hera is called to help with the children. She takes Agapios' face in her hands and looks into his eyes. \"You are a good man.\" She says before she goes. They meet again at night and Hera tells him about Zeus. \"The man who never loved me.\" She says. \"Your husband.\" He says. \"Not anymore.\" She says. They are good friends, Hera the beauty who ran from a fickle marriage and Agapios the tortured scholar. The elders share wise looks and amused expressions and secretly begin wagering on their growing friendship. \"You two would make a charming couple.\" Agathe tells Agapios one night as he helps the elderly woman below deck. He blushes and excuses himself but finds his eyes lingering on Hera for the remainder of the trip. The ship docks on the shores of Troy and the caravan sets out once more. One by one their numbers dwindle as caravan members decide to settle in the villages they pass. Agapios always makes sure they have all they require before moving on, climbing roofs to check for leaks, cutting up extra firewood. Hera cannot help but admire his dedication. \"I made a promise.\" He reminds her when she scolds him for nearly falling off the roof. Finally there is no one left but Agathe the old woman who lost her sons, Agapios the lonely scholar, and Hera. \"Ask her.\" Agathe urges pushing Agapios to Hera. He stumbles forward and clears his throat, nervously wringing his hands. Hera hides a smile behind her hair. He's not sure what to say, how does one ask a woman, a friend, if she would like to live with him without sounding forward and presumptuous? Hera's eyes are twinkling and she giggles into her hand. \"Yes.\" She says before he can ask. The three of them move into a small house on the edge of the village. Agathe sets up her spinning wheel in one room and leaves the rest of the house to the young ones. Agapios chops firewood and fixes up the roof and Hera hangs lanterns in every window. They are the family that lives in the little house of light. There are shadows under Agathe's eyes and Hera suspects that she is having nightmares but Agathe does not mention anything and Agapios is blissfully oblivious so Hera says nothing. They go into town once a week, Agapios works as a scribe for the merchants and Hera helps sell the wonderful creations born of Agathe's loom and spinning wheel. This week Agathe has made nothing; she sits at the window and stares at the sky. \"Oh child,\" she says when Hera comes to sit with her, \"I am dying.\" No! No, no, no. Hera does not realise she is crying until Agathe wipes away her tears, her hands are trembling and she's shaking her head. \"It must be a mistake.\" She croaks, voice catching in her throat. \"No mistake little one. Thanatos will be coming for me soon.\" Agapios comes home and finds Hera crying in Agathe's embrace. He rushes over and the three of them spend the night on the floor by Agathe's window laughing and crying and remembering. Agathe has written a list for them, things they always forget to do she says. \"Remember to wear extra clothes when you climb on the roof, boy. You'll need padding in case you fall.\" She reminds Hera to put out the lanterns, \"You never seem to remember.\" She teases them relentlessly, taking their hands and clasping them together. \"These four years have been the best in my life since my sons died. Take care of each other.\" Agathe closes her eyes. They lay her out on her bed in a new gown, crisp and white, Agathe had bought it recently. Never know when you'll need to look your best, she had said. She must have known for a while, Hera thinks. They cover her eyes with gold coins and pray until the fire burns out. Agapios has fallen into a fitful slumber when Hera slips out the door. Thanatos is draped in shadows; the air around him is thick with death and sorrow. He nods at her in greeting and makes to enter the house. Hera stops him, \"Must you take her?\" Thanatos sighs, \"I'm sorry.\" Hera drops her arm and follows him inside. He passes his hands over Agathe's face with the touch of a lover and presses a tender kiss to her brow. \"It is done.\" Thanatos says, patting Hera's shoulder as he passes. They are outside again when Hera asks, \"Will you tell Zeus?\" Thanatos chuckles, a deep rich sound, \"I report to Hades.\" He says, \"Your brother will not betray you.\" And then he is gone and Hera is standing alone in the shadows. \"I heard you,\" Agapios tells her in the morning, \"talking to Thanatos. You're not named after the goddess, you are the goddess.\" Hera nods and waits for his anger. He hates her, she thinks, she would hate her too. There is a long stretch of silence and then, \"I love you.\" He says, he's smiling at her, so bright and sunny and heartbreakingly beautiful and she has to suppress the urge to poke his dimples. \"I wanted you to know before you left.\" He takes her hand and kisses her palm, Agapios looks like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders and she wants to take him in her arms and never let him go. \"Left?\" his confession leaves her dazed, she feels light and fluttery, as though she has sprouted a thousand wings that let her hover above the ground. \"Tell me the truth Hera.\" He says her name reverently, \"Are they coming for you? The gods?\" \"No, no,\" she says, \"they will not come for me.\" She is crying again, so many tears in so many days, but these are happy tears. \"And even if they do I will not leave you.\" \"I will never leave you.\" Agapios promises. It is a lie of course. Agapios breaks his promise two years later. It is not his fault, he is only mortal after all. The blade is sharp and stained with his blood. Agapios staggers backward and slides down the stone wall of the dark alley. The fat merchant sneers at him between his wiry mustache and extra chin. Hera will be his by the morning. She's inconsolable, a tempest in her grief and rage. The merchant tells her that it was a group of bandits, that Agapios sacrificed himself in the skirmish. Hera doesn't believe him. She casts him out of the house and covers Agapios' body with her own, sobbing her lament. Thanatos knocks on the door twice before he enters. Hera is ready for him. \"Who?\" she asks, the question is dripping with venom. \"The merchant.\" Thanatos lets her hold Agapios' hand while he performs the ritual, \"I'm sorry.\" He says. Hera walks Thanatos out the door, and then morphs into a vicious beast, seeking retribution. She doesn't have time to wait for Nemesis. No, she must do this with her own hands. The merchant is reclining luxuriously on his bed, eyes closed and running his thick fingers along his thighs. \"Hera,\" he moans. She wills herself not to kill him on the spot and then clears her throat, stepping into the room with a coy smile. \"I need someone.\" She says, the epitome of a promiscuous widow. He scrambles to his feet and lumbers toward her, fingers twitching in anticipation. He's barely grazed her skin before he crashes to the floor howling in pain, blood gushing between his legs. Hera sets the house on fire and leaves before Thanatos comes calling again. She goes south when autumn comes, joining the birds on their pilgrimage. Hera is cold to the bone, has been since she burnt the merchant with the last of her rage. She's hollow now and she thinks she can hear the wind whistling through her empty chest, pulling at her withered lungs. She is searching for something. Warmth? Hera doesn't know. She crosses the sea and heads west into the desert. The heat beats mercilessly on her skin, burning her, branding her and Hera feels deliciously mortal. She treks across the scalding sands for days, never stopping, never sleeping. She relishes the unbearable heat, it helps her forget. Her clothes fray and tatter but she is no less beautiful. Hera is grieving in the sand, and that is how they find her. A group of eight with golden skin, swathed in heavy scarves, weary travelers who have weathered cruel storms and crueler people. They help her onto the back of a camel and together they spend a week under the relentless sun. Hera rides with a man named Muhammad. He's on his way home to his wife and daughter with a bag of gold he earned abroad. His wife is pregnant, he tells her excitedly, and they are certain it will be a boy. \"And what of your family?\" he asks her. Hera's throat tightens and she can feel the bile churning in her stomach, \"I have no family,\" she says. Muhammad pats her shoulder paternally. \"Nonsense,\" he says, \"you can stay with us.\" Muhammad's house is in the heart of a crowded dusty city, it is small and made of tightly packed mud but it is full of warmth and love. They are greeted by a tiny girl with large amber eyes, bouncing at the door. \"Papa, papa!\" She cries, jumping into Muhammad's outstretched arms. He laughs and sets her down to embrace his wife. Hera wonders if there was ever a time when her life was like this. She feels a tug on her dress and looks down to see Muhammad's daughter staring at her. \"Hello, my name is Neela.\" Her eyes are bright and unblinking, full of curiosity. \"I am Hera.\" She tells them her story, the caravan, Agathe, she cries when she tells them of Agapios. Neela holds her hand tightly, \"Don't cry,\" she tells her, \"he wouldn't want you to be sad.\" \"She's right, there will be no tears in this house,\" says pregnant Marah. Muhammad's wife is beautiful and with the authority of a loving mother, tells Hera to help her cook dinner. Hera settles in with the growing family, helping with the chores that are too difficult for Marah. They treat her like their own, Marah makes her a new dress and braids her hair and Muhammad chases away the young men who gather to watch Hera at their pottery stand outside the house. Marah teaches her how to work clay, moulding it into beautiful shapes and Muhammad shows her how to fire the kiln. Soon their little stand is flocked with men who wish to buy bowls made by Muhammad's desert daughter. Winter comes and goes and it is mid-spring when Marah gives birth to a boy with Neela's eyes. \"He is beautiful.\" Hera says, passing the babe to his proud father. \"And now I have three children.\" Muhammad laughs, pressing a kiss to Marah's sweat soaked brow. They name him Khurram and Neela yells excitedly in Hera's ear. \"We have a brother!\" The new baby is fascinated with the world, he likes to crawl and climb and wriggle into small spaces. He likes to tug on Hera's braid and stuff it in his mouth. Khurram loves Hera, Hera loves him too. Autumn comes again and Hera is warm. It is night in the desert, dark and cool and the winds tumble through the streets racing to the east window of Muhammad's house. Hera secures a lantern to the windowsill, waiting for the breeze to deliver messages from Greece. Across the room, Neela is asleep and dreaming and all is quiet save for the low buzzing around Hera's window. The lantern flickers madly in the restless breeze, flirting with the winds as they swirl impatiently, waiting for their turns to whisper in Hera's ear. They sing songs of prayers and pleas, of the young woman who is pregnant with her first child, the younger woman who is preparing for her wedding, and the older one who fears her husband may cast her aside. She listens to them all and composes songs of her own, blessings with shimmering notes and glittering tunes, and bids the winds to send them across the desert and over the sea. She works through the night and the early hours of the morning, the sun is just beginning to stretch its rays when the last breeze blows past her ear. \"Mother,\" Hebe's voice, high and clear and wispy, \"I'm getting married mother.\" Oh sweet daughter, Hera's heart warms, dear sweet Hebe deserves all the love and happiness in the world. \"To Heracles.\" Hera's heart stops, constricted by icy fingers that dig and burrow their nails into the muscle. \"Please don't be angry,\" the wind cries in Hebe's voice. \"He loves me. He's struggled with himself for a long time, hating himself for loving me because...\" I am your daughter. Hera hears the unspoken words and the nails burrow a little bit deeper and her throat feels a little bit tighter and are those tears trying to leap from her eyes? \"He loves me, mother, and I love him. I am asking for your blessings but I understand if you do not wish to give them. I am sorry if I upset you.\" No, daughter, she shakes her head, do not be sorry for finding love. Never be sorry for your happiness my dear. Hera weaves a wedding veil, beautiful and iridescent, with her blessings and her tears. Her love. Be happy daughter, be happy. She secures it to the wind with a pin from her hair, a cluster of tiny pearls set in fine gold, a gift from Marah, my mother. She sends the wind on its way, to my daughter, and watches it dance beyond the horizon. You have my blessings dear one. Her siblings show him no great love when she tells them. They warn her away from him, intercept his letters and tokens of affection. Eris returns them to him, unopened, in front of the other gods (always eager to stir trouble that one). \"Stay away from my sister.\" \"Keep your distance, boy,\" Hephaestus tells him, eyes gouging holes in his skull. Ares is less subtle, he beats Heracles into the ground and rants and raves until Eileithyia pulls him away. Hebe finds him afterwards to apologise. \"They only want to protect me.\" She apologises too, on behalf of her mother, bows to him over and over, \"I do not wish to excuse or justify what she did, but my mother is gone now and I imagine I will never see her again.\" Hebe's eyes are wet and she tells him to stop sending her gifts, to turn his attentions elsewhere. \"Tormenting Hera's children will not ease your pain,\" she says. \"Let us have peace.\" She doesn't know, doesn't understand how hard he has tried to stay away. He has spent every night with a different body in his bed; men, women, mortals, nymphs, each more beautiful than the last. He has nearly drowned himself in Dionysus' prized collection and still he cannot forget her. (-) He's not quite sure when it started or how. It wasn't like this at first, in the beginning he hated them all. Seeing Hera's volatile (Ares), deformed (Hephaestus) children enjoying immortality while his own precious family rot in the ground was unbearable. Eris is chaotic, sparking arguments wherever she goes, like mother like daughter, Heracles thinks. Eileithyia is condescending, \"I lead new life into the world,\" he hears her tell the nymphs and he wishes he could end hers if only to rid the world of her smug smirk. The cupbearer is the worst though. If her siblings are reflections of her mother then she is naught but a mote of dust upon the mirror; too pleasant and cheerful to be Hera's daughter. He despised her for he could find nothing to despise in her. He saw her everywhere, smiling, laughing, she was friendly to him and he loathed it. He wanted more than anything to rip the smile from her face and grind her teeth into nothing. It was oh so gratifying for him to watch Zeus tear Hera down, see the proud queen reduced to a broken hollow shell, and then he saw Hebe, the gentle (useless, awful, smiling) daughter, silence the court in her mother's name. She was fire, molten and searing, she was glorious. (-) His eyes seemed to have a mind of their own; they searched for her constantly, scouring the grounds. \"She doesn't come to Olympus anymore, none of them do,\" Apollo tells him, happy to no longer have to deal with his half siblings. Part of him rejoices and thinks perhaps now he will be free of her spell, the other half recoils and twists uncomfortably in the pit of his stomach. One month passes, two, the twisting becomes a painful gnawing. Logic tells him to stay away, he's going to destroy himself, and he tries hard to listen. Three months, four, five, six, the gnawing is now tearing at his insides, he thinks it's (whatever it is) chewing up his organs. Seven months, eight, nine, clawing at his ribcage, bursting through his chest. Ten months, eleven, he almost makes it to a year when Hades comes to court. His uncle observes his behaviour and tells him bluntly that Olympus has turned him into an idiot. Heracles writes his first letter to Hebe that night. Her response is brief and impersonal, telling him to cease his cruel jokes. She does not reply to his second letter or his third. (-) \"I love you.\" He says, catching her wrist before she can leave. \"I do not jest,\" pulling her against him, \"I do not lie.\" Oh how he's longed for this. \"I don't love you.\" She says, \"I don't feel anything for you.\" \"Let me change that.\" (-) \"What is the meaning of this?\" Hephaestus demands when Heracles presents himself as a possible suitor. \"I am in love with Hebe.\" \"You lie!\" Ares' sword sits angrily on Heracles' throat. \"Let him try his hand,\" Eileithyia says. \"Hebe will not love him.\" (-) She doesn't smile anymore. He tries and tries and tries, writes her letters and poems, gifts her beautiful trinkets that match her eyes but she never smiles for him. \"I don't want any of it.\" \"Tell me what you want and I will give it to you.\" \"You cannot give me what I want.\" (-) \"A challenge?\" Apollo rubs his hands together gleefully. \"Fear not, I will help you.\" (-) Apollo's advice fails miserably and Heracles demolishes a marble wall in his rage (it's Ares' house anyways). How dare she spurn him when he has braved all his demons, practically sacrificed his sanity for her! \"So I should be grateful to you because you chose me? I should succumb to your will because you 'fell in love'?\" Hebe narrows her eyes. \"I never asked for you Heracles!\" She hisses, \"I am not obligated to return your feelings. If it is retribution against my mother you seek then you will not get it from me!\" \"I do not care about you mother!\" \"I do! And I will not love some who enjoys her pain!\" (-) \"You were right.\" \"Of course I'm right,\" Eileithyia says. She spares Heracles a pitying glance. \"You are stuck, back from the dead but not living as you should. You can't honestly expect my sister to love you as you are now?\" \"I don't understand...\" \"You have been given another chance to live, reborn as a new man, a god. You are Heracles the immortal, let go of your mortal memories.\" (-) Heracles pays his homeland one last visit, bids farewell to an existence that caused him so much pain. He has a new purpose now. (-) He pushes past an indignant Eris and breaks down Hebe's doors. Ares will have his head but he has to tell her. \"I understand now.\" He says, gripping her shoulders tightly, \"I understand.\" (-) Their renewed courtship is a whirlwind, strong and destructive. Hephaestus and Ares disapprove. Zeus even offers to let Hebe choose any man in the world that suit her fancy. \"I choose Heracles.\" (-) \"I love you.\" \"Finally.\" The gods of Olympus do not track time, it is a pointless endeavor, but if they did Heracles is sure that he has been chasing Hebe for years. Finally he has her, heart and soul and forever, and still he cannot have her. \"Mother will never approve,\" Eris says, for once not hostile or challenging. Her hands are gentle on Hebe's face. \"Think about what you are doing sister.\" Hebe is stricken, trembling violently and he reaches for her but Ares is there first. They guide her away and Hephaestus stops him when he goes to follow. \"Eileithyia says your words are true.\" \"She is correct.\" \"For you sake she better be.\" Heracles finds that courting Hebe's siblings is a more arduous task than any he has faced before, and this time Eileithyia does not help him. \"I am a goddess not a miracle worker,\" she says. Surprisingly Hephaestus is the easiest to win over, though Heracles doesn't as much win him over as Hephaestus tires of his ever present pestering in his workshop. \"It is not up to me,\" he sighs, \"all I want is for my sister to be happy.\" \"It's not my decision to make,\" Eris tells him when he visits, unannounced, for the eighty-sixth time. He follows Ares to the arena and lets the war god beat him countless times. \"I can beat you into oblivion and it will not change a thing.\" Why? If not them then who gets to decide? Hera, even when she has disappeared for years the woman still manages to torture him. They sit around a stone table, Eileithyia, Hephaestus, Eris, Ares, and try their best to explain to him with their silence. Heracles hangs his head, crushing the bench between his fingers. He has let go of his hatred towards Hera, when will she? The door bursts opens with a bang and Iris stumbles in, dishevelled and ecstatic, her eyes are wild and gleaming with excitement. She's babbling nonsense, tugging Eileithyia from her seat frantically. \"Lady Hebe! At the window!\" Ares and Heracles are on their feet at once, destroying several hallways in their hurry. Hebe is in tears, crumpled by the window. \"Ares!\" she calls, reaching for her brother. \"What has happened?\" Ares kneels by his sister. \"Mother...\" Hebe sobs, clutching at her chest, \"mother...\" Her hands are tangled in a shimmering glow, a gossamer material twisting in the light, a wedding veil. \"Mother...\" The room quiets and a strong wind spins around them, singing Hera's blessings. \"Do you know what this means?\" Iris takes the veil and pins it to Hebe's hair with a cluster of pearls. The siblings are silent and Heracles is so, so hopeful. \"Lady Hera must be desperate for grandchildren.\" The wedding is a modest affair but Hebe has never looked so grand, with pearls in her hair and a veil trailing behind her. She smiles at her guests and bows down to receive a kiss from Zeus. \"Are you happy daughter?\" \"Yes.\" There is drinking and dancing, beautiful nymphs prancing but all Zeus can see are his daughter's eyes shining with gaiety. \"Your veil is beautiful.\" \"It was a gift.\" He doesn't know what made her siblings relent but he sees Hephaestus smiling for the first time in ages and Ares is twirling Eileithyia in circles among the dancers, even Eris decides to spare Apollo from a taunting of his ridiculous outfit and pats his back instead. Zeus feels a little lighter and a little brighter and hopes and prays that things will stay this way. He sees Poseidon conversing with Iris and goes to join them. Their heads are bent and their words are hushed. \"It is Lady Hera's creation.\" Iris whispers and Zeus can almost pinpoint the precise moment when his heart stops beating. \"A beautiful wedding gift,\" Poseidon says. \"How does my sister fare?\" \"I know not,\" Iris sighs. \"Only Lady Hebe has spoken to her, and even then it was indirectly.\" Zeus clears his throat and steps to them purposefully. Iris hurriedly excuses herself and Poseidon raises his eyebrow. \"Enjoying yourself brother?\" \"Don't change the subject...\" \"I remember your wedding,\" Poseidon says, taking a sip from his goblet. \"Very elaborate, very you. I remember the golden chairs and the golden plates, even your fingernails were painted gold!\" He chuckles, \"Hera just wanted to have dinner.\" \"Let us leave the past alone tonight brother,\" Poseidon waves his empty goblet in the air and turns back to the crowd. \"Just for a little while.\" Neela is twelve when she wakes in the middle of the night and sees her sister pressing glowing fingertips to her skin; and the smooth surface is wrinkling and Hera is aging before her eyes. \"Magic woman,\" Neela breathes. \"Can you teach me?\" Aging charms, Hera shows her, hair greying with a flick of her wrist, because Hera doesn't age. \"What if I want to live forever?\" \"Forever is a long time little one.\" Neela is fourteen when the suitors come. They bring gifts of silk and money and Neela rejects them all \"I am magic, papa. My husband must be magic too.\" Muhammad laughs and strokes her hair fondly, \"Papa will find you a magic husband.\" Neela is fourteen and seven months when one of the men she rejected tries to force himself on her. He corners her in an alley and pins her to the wall. \"Where is your magic now?\" Sneers the general's son. Her eyes glow bright and her hair whips furiously in the wind. Neela pries his hands off of her and blots the alley in shadow. \"I am magic.\" There is not enough of him left for a funeral. Neela is fifteen when war comes. The general takes all the able bodied men he can find to serve in his army. Muhammad is too old and Khurram too young but he takes them anyway. \"You can't do this!\" Marah cries. \"I can and I will!\" The general spits. \"This is punishment, this is for my son!\" Hera sets his beard on fire when he walks out the door. Neela follows him and sets his hands on fire. Neela is seventeen when they lose the war. Muhammad is dead and Khurram is missing and Marah is delirious with grief. \"Take care of mother.\" Neela tells Hera as she gathers her belongings \"Where are you going?\" \"To find our brother.\" Neela is seventeen and five months when she breaks into the sultan's dungeons. She freezes the guards and melts the iron chains. \"Run.\" She tells the prisoners. Khurram has been tortured and starved, there is a scar under his right eye and he is bleeding. \"How?\" He asks as Neela heals his wounds and spirits him away. \"Magic.\" Neela is seventeen and seven months when her family is on the run from the new regime. Marah's health is failing fast and even Hera is powerless to restore her. She dies watching the sun set. They cremate her body and her daughters send her ashes to the winds, twisting, waving goodbye. \"Magic,\" Khurram whispers. \"Teach me.\" Neela is nineteen when Khurram leaves them. He returns to the sultan's palace seeking revenge. The guards shoot him full of arrows but he manages to burn them to the ground. Khurram kills them all, and dies. Neela is twenty two. \"Do you ever think about the future?\" Hera asks her. \"Yes,\" she replies. \"I think you will leave me too.\" \"It is inevitable.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I am forever.\" \"I am magic.\" \"But you are not forever.\" \"Forever is a long time.\" \"Yes little one.\" Neela is twenty two and one day old and she is exhausted. She closes her eyes, and goes to sleep. The girl is just short of childbearing age, too young for impassioned attentions and too old for childish coddling. She struggles viciously against her minders as they force her into elaborate wedding finery. \"Stop your fussing!\" \"No!\" She sinks her teeth into a maid's arm and elbows the other. They stumble back and she runs. Through her uncle's gardens and out the gates, faster, faster, don't let them catch you. Footsteps behind her, heavy, hurried, her uncle's men but she is lighter and faster. Into the forest, weaving between the trees, her uncle's men are caught in the branches but she's smaller and nimbler. The night is black and inky, her uncle's men have torches, \"I have fed you and clothed you for thirteen years,\" she hears her uncle holler, \"it is time for you to repay me you ungrateful girl!\" No! She screams in her head and keeps running. The winds are strong tonight, they huff and puff and they blow out the torches. Follow the star, they hiss. Up ahead she sees the star, bright, humming with energy, it curves a graceful arc and zooms forward. Her uncle's men are tangled in vines and darkness, she follows the star. Across the valley and over the hills, farther, farther, she can't hear her uncle's shouts anymore. Almost there, almost there, the sound of water, waves cheering her on from the shore. The star stops and hovers above a small boat, hurry, hurry, it chirps. She pushes the boat into the water and climbs in. There are no oars on board, hurry, hurry, the winds send her on her way. Hurry, hurry, the waters usher her on her voyage. Hurry, hurry, the star guides her to her destination. She wakes in the early morning on a beach across the sea. The star swoops down and perches on her shoulder. \"You saved me.\" \"You prayed for me to.\" \"Hera?\" She gasps. Starlight melts into glossy feathers and the nightingale nips the girl's shoulder playfully. \"Yes.\" \"There is a seamstress in a town not far from here,\" the nightingale twitters. \"She's looking for an apprentice.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Let us resume our journey.\" The nightingale soars into the sky and glows, the brightest star. The sun's not shining today, it's hidden behind layers of thick grey cloud. It's cold enough for snow and the sea water chills to the bone. The waves curl forlornly around the coast; their queen is weeping. Amphitrite sits on a battered cove, dragging her fingers through the sand. She remembers when they used to come here, she and Hera, to watch the sailors go by. They would escape their mother, sneak away when Tethys was occupied, and hide on the surface, sometimes for days. \"What if you get married and leave me behind?\" She remembers asking, gripping Hera's hand tightly. \"I wouldn't leave you.\" Hera had said, laughing at her silliness. Then Zeus came and claimed her sister. \"You missed court today,\" Poseidon is behind her, stepping cautiously into her cove. \"I'm sure no one noticed.\" \"I noticed.\" \"Did you?\" She laughs brokenly, \"I thought you only noticed the beautiful nymphs coming and going from Olympus.\" She turns and offers him a smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes. \"You and your brother are very much alike.\" Poseidon bristles, \"you've gone mad.\" \"No,\" she shakes her head. \"I am tired.\" She takes his hand and pulls him to sit beside her. She leans into him, still holding his hand, Poseidon wraps and arm around his wife. \"I used to think you loved me,\" Amphitrite says quietly. \"You visited every day, you consoled me after Zeus took my sister,\" she sighs. \"I thought you loved me.\" He wants to speak, to tell her he does love her, so much that he burns with jealousy to even hear her speak of Hera with admiration. \"I knew I loved you.\" Did she? She's never told him, never acknowledged any affection except for the heartbreaking smile she gave him when he asked for her hand. I will see my sister again? And his heart fell into his stomach because she didn't really want to marry him, she just wanted to see her sister, but he was willing to take anything she gave because she's Amphitrite and magnificent and he loved her. \"I was so happy to marry the man I loved and to be able to see Hera again made everything even better.\" She laughs bitterly. \"But it wasn't better. It was torture to see Zeus hurt her without batting an eyelash. And you...you are very like your brother.\" No, he tightens his arm around her, no, he screams in his mind, I only thought you didn't love me! A horrible excuse he knows but he can feel her slipping away and he can't, won't, live without her. \"I'm tired Poseidon, and weak. I cannot leave everything behind as Hera has done.\" She looks up at him, pleading with her eyes, \"I need you to let me go.\" \"No!\" Poseidon explodes, he holds her to his chest fiercely. \"Never! I can never let you go. Please don't leave me...\" Amphitrite is stunned, she tries to move back, to see his face but he holds her tighter. \"Please don't leave me,\" he cries into her hair, \"I didn't know, I didn't know that you loved me too, I thought...please...\" He presses a million tear stained kisses into her hair, \"Another chance, Amphitrite, give me another chance,\" he pleads. \"Another chance,\" she breathes, taking his hand again and lacing their fingers together. Amphitrite leans up and kisses Poseidon's brow, \"another chance.\" The waves dance joyously at their feet. On the other side of the cove there is a nightingale sitting dangerously close to the water. Hera whispers good luck to the couple and takes off, trailing the nightingale's song to the sun. There is a scar on Hephaestus' face, a jagged reminder that his father had cast him away as an infant, just born and barely able to open his eyes. He might have been beautiful if not for this scar and the twisted leg that pained him when it rained. \"Do not be ashamed,\" Ares told him. \"Scars are a warrior's badges of honour.\" But he is, he is ashamed of his face and his leg, ashamed of the ugliness that forced his parents to abandon him. His own parents were so disgusted that they threw him away, how could he expect anyone to love him? \"How could you even think that you are worthy of me?\" Aphrodite had said on their wedding night. He did not touch her after that. He shut himself away in his forge, chiselling gold and hammering silver, letting his ugly hands spin beautiful creations. He was so happy when his mother came, finally breaking free of his father's will. She welcomed him into her embrace and cried over and over, my beautiful boy. And then she was gone but he was still happy because he knew she loved him so very much and he knew she was suffering, so he tipped back his goblet, draining the wine and shouted farewells to the wind. For a while after his mother leaves, he thinks he can be happy because he and his siblings have never been closer but he finds Aphrodite in bed with his brother and his heart breaks all over again. They don't speak of it and Ares doesn't apologise but Hephaestus sees the regret and he sees Ares try and he thinks it's enough, it has to be enough. Still, he distances himself from his brother just a bit and spends a little more time in his forge and his creations have never been more spectacular. Eris breaks into his workshop one day and hauls him into his chambers. \"We're going to a party,\" she announces, picking through his meager wardrobe. Eileithyia comes in with two attendants and shoves him, work gear and all, into the bathwater. They spend an hour primping and polishing, Hebe enters with a stack of new robes because, \"You have two robes Hephaestus. Two. How is that even possible?\" Eris asks. Eileithyia sits him in front of the mirror and he is pleasantly surprised. \"We had to drag that over from Aphrodite's room,\" Eileithyia says, \"I couldn't even find a reflective surface in here.\" Of course she couldn't, he's made sure of that; Hephaestus despises his reflection. Eris orders one of the attendants to return the floor length mirror and tugs Hephaestus from his chair. \"Hurry up.\" The mirror is too heavy and the flustered attendant stumbles and finds herself blinking wide eyes in Hephaestus' lap. \"I...I'm so sorry my lord!\" A lovely crimson blush staining her cheeks. Hephaestus laughs, \"it's alright my dear.\" He helps her to her feet and stops when she reaches for the mirror again. \"I'll move that later. I imagine you would want to ready yourself for the party...\" \"Aglaea,\" she supplies. \"Aglaea, a beautiful name for a beautiful girl,\" Hephaestus smiles. \"Go prepare yourself and enjoy the party.\" Hebe and Eileithyia share a look as they usher him out the door. \"You are quite the charmer brother,\" Eris says slyly. \"What do you mean?\" Hephaestus asks obliviously. The party is splendid and Hephaestus even dances with Hebe despite his leg. Dionysus has just received the year's offering of wine and he is eager to share. \"Have a drink Hephaestus, you work too much.\" Hephaestus is happy and laughing, he's swaying with Eileithyia and maybe kind of just a little bit drunk. He bumps into someone, they crash to the ground and he finds himself staring at a pair of wide blinking eyes in his lap. \"Aglaea?\" \"I'm so sorry my lord!\" She blushes violently as Dionysus roars with laughter behind them. Hephaestus grins and lifts her up easily with one arm. \"It's alright my dear.\" They see each other everywhere after that. Aglaea is one of Aphrodite's attendants, slipping away from her mistress whenever she can and peeking into Hephaestus' rooms. Oblivious, Hephaestus greets her in the halls and even makes her a necklace for her birthday. \"It's beautiful,\" Aglaea's eyes sparkle with awe and admiration and perhaps a little bit of something more. \"A beautiful gift for a beautiful girl,\" Hephaestus smiles obliviously. Aphrodite comes to his bed that night but Hephaestus finds himself strangely unaffected by her nakedness. She destroys half his room and tells him it's embarrassing to watch him court his whore. \"You are just like your father!\" She spits. Hephaestus doesn't understand. \"I don't even know who she's talking about.\" He tells Eileithyia the next day. \"Aglaea, brother, she's talking about Aglaea.\" \"But Aglaea is no whore!\" It takes all three of them to explain it to him. Eileithyia, Eris, and Hebe all take turns convincing him that Aglaea has feelings for him. \"But...I'm ugly...\" \"You're not ugly, you're an idiot.\" Eris says. Later Hephaestus sits alone, contemplating in his workshop. \"What am I to do?\" He feels a sharp poking on his hand and looks down to see a glossy little nightingale pecking his fingers. \"How did you get in here little bird?\" The nightingale tilts her head and hops onto his shoulder. \"I'll tell you what you should do,\" she chirps brightly. \"Oh?\" Hephaestus raises his eyebrow. \"Pick the one that makes you smile,\" the nightingale says simply. \"The one that makes you happy.\" \"It's not that easy...\" \"Of course it is!\" The nightingale nips his ear. \"Your mother would want you to be happy.\" Hephaestus watches the nightingale fly away. Thank you mother. \"What is this?\" Aphrodite asks when Hephaestus lays the bracelet in front of her. \"A parting gift,\" he says. \"We are free of each other now.\" \"Free?\" Her face is stoic but there's a flash in her eyes. Panic? Impossible, Hephaestus decides. \"A divorce.\" \"Fine,\" she gathers the bracelet from the table. \"I'll be gone before week's end.\" \"No,\" he stops her. \"The house is yours. I practically live in my workshop anyways.\" He finds Aglaea later, packing her thing., \"What are you doing?\" He asks from the door. \"The Lady Aphrodite has dismissed my services,\" she sniffles. \"I'm sorry Aglaea,\" he shuffles his feet uncertainly. \"I came at an inopportune moment, and to think I was going to ask to court you at such a time...\" \"What?\" \"I'm sorry...\" \"No,\" Aglaea is breathless, excited. \"You want to court me?\" She asks. \"Yes, but if...\" \"Yes!\" She cuts him off, jumping into his arms and knocking them both to the floor. \"I'm so sorry my lord!\" \"It's alright my dear.\" Aphrodite is invited to Hephaestus and Aglaea's wedding. \"A gesture of friendship,\" Hermes tells her when he delivers the message. \"Personally if I were Hephaestus, I'd snub you for eternity.\" Aphrodite hurls a vase at his retreating head and shreds the invite to pieces... The first time Aphrodite meets Hephaestus is against the backdrop of a chaotic court. Hephaestus is angry and vengeful and he has bound his mother to her throne. The gods are begging him to release their queen but he is immovable. Aphrodite watches, fascinated, as he takes on an army of shining gods, this creature, so damaged he has nothing to lose. And she wants to feel sympathy for him, this pitiful man, but all she feels is betrayal and hatred because he's demanding her hand as payment and they're agreeing. She curses them all as Hephaestus hauls her over his shoulder and carries her off the mountain. The second time Aphrodite meets Hephaestus they are sitting across from each other in his little room, she on the bed and he on the floor resting his aching leg. He apologises to her over and over. He only wanted to punish his parents, he never thought they would actually appease his outrageous demands. He tells her that he doesn't want to be like his father, that he'll take responsibility for his actions and he'll do everything in his power to make her happy. And she feels her heart flutter just a little but Aphrodite is still stinging from betrayal so she tells him in her coldest voice that he's unworthy and watches the hope crumble off his face. She doesn't see much of him after that. Hephaestus pours himself into his work and leaves her to do as she pleases. Not a week into their marriage Aphrodite takes a lover. She flaunts it to spite him and takes pleasure when he averts his eyes and slinks away. The feeling is fleeting and quickly replaced with a heaviness she cannot define but Aphrodite ignores it the best she can and dedicates herself to frivolity. Hephaestus is polite to her and ever respectful and she hates him for it because she can see him swimming in heartache, but retaliation never comes. She jeers and sneers and taunts and finally he tells her, \"I'm not my parents,\" he says. \"The last time I tried to be I ruined you. Never again.\" Ruined. He thinks she's ruined? Aphrodite wrecks havoc in Hephaestus' workshop and leaves it in ruins. The third time Aphrodite meets Hephaestus he is huddled in his mother's arms. He towers over Hera but his mother manages to make him look like a young boy in her embrace. Aphrodite spies on them from her hiding spot behind the door and sees her husband smile for the first time. He's beautiful when he smiles, a tragic kind of beauty wrought from a lifetime of pain and unhappiness and Aphrodite's not quite sure when she developed this urge to protect him, hide him from the world. She stops taking lovers, spends her time instead, cataloguing his expressions and trying to gather the courage to tell him, tell him...what? She's not sure. She doesn't know what to do to get him to stop avoiding her, stop averting his eyes, look at me, look at me! And the one time she does manage to make him smile, it's small and sad and painful. She stumbles into Ares one night. He's drunk and angry and he thinks she's Athena and if she squints and tilts her head just right, he kind of looks like Hephaestus. The real Hephaestus finds them in the morning. The fourth time Aphrodite meets Hephaestus he is surrounded by a laughing crowd. They're singing and dancing and Hephaestus is smiling. Aphrodite feels her heart beat faster and her cheeks grow warmer, she smoothes her skirts and steps forward only for Hebe to steal his attention away. And she's confused by the glare Hebe throws at her until she sees Eileithyia not so subtly push he husband into Aglaea. Aphrodite has never felt a jealousy so strong. It cuts through her like a thousand swords, she's angry at Hephaestus and his sisters, but most of all she's angry at Aglaea, this stupid little fool, nowhere near as beautiful as herself, has made her husband laugh. She watches their friendship grow with a critical eye, watches as another woman falls head over heels in love with her husband, watches her dear Hephaestus slip away from her. And she knows she has no one but herself to blame but she still assigns Aglaea the most unpleasant tasks to perform. The fifth time Aphrodite meets Hephaestus he's holding her hand and giving her a bittersweet smile. She's lost him forever and there's nothing else she can do, so she lets her fingertips remember the pattern of calluses on his palm and accepts the very last gift he'll ever give her. Aphrodite wears Hephaestus' bracelet under her robes, right above her heart... She doesn't go to Hephaestus' wedding. She wants to say she's happy for him but she can't. And even in a room full of lovers, Aphrodite is solitary. Winter comes early this year when impatient Persephone steals away to see her husband. The nymphs gather to gossip and laugh at the wayward girl and as punishment Demeter freezes their rivers and lakes. And so Poseidon's palace is packed with refugees hoping to earn the favour of the notorious god. They flock to the throne room and the halls outside his chambers, hair tousled seductively and dressed to the nines, but the king is nowhere to be found. Indeed his presence has been missing for days and the queen's rooms have been equally silent. \"What do you mean he's not coming?!\" Zeus' roar has the ground shaking and Hermes dodging to avoid his spittle. \"If Poseidon's not coming then I believe this meeting is adjourned.\" Hades says, gesturing for an attendant to retrieve his cloak. \"Now if you'll excuse me, my wife is waiting.\" Hermes is quick to follow and the room is emptied in seconds. Zeus, idle on his throne and stewing in anger, decides to pay his brother a visit. The seas are frigid and the air is thick with falling snow but Amphitrite insists on walking barefoot. Poseidon trails behind her, one hand swinging her winter boots and the other poised to catch her should she fall. Amphitrite hops from rock to icy rock wholly unaware of the mini heart attacks she is giving her husband as she balances herself on the slippery surface. Today Poseidon's path of penance has brought them to the shores of Troy. \"Poseidon,\" she calls, arms reaching for him, lips forming a delectable pout. \"I'm cold.\" He gathers her to his chest, brushing the snow off her shoulders and out of her hair. Amphitrite burrows her hands inside his cloak, chilly fingertips skimming his skin. She leans into him, flicking her tongue against his Adam's apple and kissing the curve of his jaw. \"Amphitrite,\" he moans, skin blazing under her touch. \"Down.\" She says, and he bends to accommodate her height. Her kisses glide up the side of his neck exquisitely slow. She stops to nibble his ear and her fingers trace abstract patterns across his chest. His blood is heating and his pulse is racing and it takes all his self control to not tear at her skirts. Amphitrite grins and presses her hips against him. \"Shall we return to our room?\" He manages to stutter between laboured breaths. \"No,\" she's already tugging on his robes. \"Here.\" \"Poseidon!\" Poseidon lets out a grunt of frustration and draws his little wife further into his cloak as he looks up at his brother. \"What?!\" He growls. \"Why are you neglecting your duties and wasting your time here frolicking in the snow?\" Amphitrite squeaks indignantly from Poseidon's chest and in defiance, presses her palm against the prominent bulge between her husband's legs. Poseidon fights down a groan, his vision is blinded by a pleasurable haze and he grips Amphtrite's waist tightly as Zeus continues his lecture. \"What do you have to say for yourself?\" \"Go away!\" Poseidon practically begs when Amphitrite grinds her hand on him. \"Not until you explain yourself!\" Poseidon almost wails in despair as Amphitrite grasps him with both hands. \"Room?\" he asks her, voice straining, sweat beading on his brow. \"Anywhere with locks.\" They're gone in a pretty swirl of heavy snow. No one wants to play with Zeus today. The snow ravaged land is still and barren. The birds have long gone but Hades' keen eyes spy a curious set of nightingale tracks circling the base of a tree. He had been on his way home when he heard the bird's song, a familiar voice calling his name. \"Hades,\" the nightingale chirps. \"Hello Hades.\" She peeks at him from snow shrouded branches. Hades kneels down and offers his hand. \"It's been a long time, sister.\" She hops onto his finger and catches his sleeve in her beak, pulling it around herself and nestling comfortably in the warm fabric. Hades settles himself under the tree and they sit together in silence, relishing the quiet companionship. Finally Hades says, \"Hephaestus has remarried.\" \"I know. She loves him very much.\" \"You were there?\" \"I've been visiting.\" Hades looks down at the little bird in his hands. \"Where have you been sister?\" \"I've walked the world,\" she says with childish delight. \"Did you know there are lands where people do not know us?\" She eyes him intently. \"Where do those people go when they die?\" She asks the question with an intensity that startles him and it takes Hades a couple beats to recover. \"I don't know,\" he tells her, shaking his head. \"Why do you ask?\" The nightingale deflates, dropping her head and dragging her wings. Hades can feel himself suffocating under a thick blanket of overwhelming sadness, \"Hera?\" She looks up and he can see the weariness in her eyes, sorrow and exhaustion sitting heavy on her mind and he wonders if she's ever once slept while she was away. \"Tell me,\" he says and waits patiently as she gathers her thoughts. What a strange sight it must have been, the dark hulking king of the underworld cradling a tiny bird in his hands, head bent and listening closely as she chattered away. Hera tells him how she found acceptance, a mentor and a lover, how they were ripped away from her, and how she grieved. She tells him about Papa Muhammad and Mama Marah and Khurram. She tells him about Neela. \"They didn't know who I was. They didn't know anything about any of us. Where do you think Neela went?\" \"I don't know.\" \"I killed her.\" She says. \"Her death is not your fault.\" \"I taught her magic.\" She buries her head in his sleeve. Hades sighs, he never once won an argument against Hera. \"Am I a sinner?\" her voice is muffled. \"Why do I kill all the things I touch?\" \"You are not a sinner, sister.\" \"Are you sure?\" Hades pats her head lightly with his finger. \"You are my precious little sister, the one who asked for stories and pulled on my hair until I let her sit on my shoulders. She could never be a sinner.\" \"Thank you,\" the nightingale says, climbing on his shoulder. There is silence again, just a brother and a sister watching the snow together. \"How is Agapios?\" She asks him hesitantly. \"He has bathed in Lethe and returned to the mortal world.\" She nods solemnly. \"Do you wish to find him?\" \"I wish for his happiness.\" Hera tugs on a lock of his hair and pecks Hades on his brow, an imitation of a kiss. \"Goodbye brother,\" she chirps, taking flight. \"Goodbye.\" \"I don't understand,\" Persephone says to her husband. \"Are we having a party?\" Hades had barely stepped through the door when he was accosted by his wife. \"What party?\" He asks, taking off his cloak. Persephone grabs his hand and leads him to the dining hall, rarely used for the couple preferred to take their meals in bed. The table was piled high with plates; Hades could barely see Poseidon's head behind a tower of fruit. \"Hello brother,\" Poseidon waves at him cheerfully. \"We started dinner without you.\" Hades raises his eyebrow at Persephone who shrugs and takes a seat beside Amphitrite. He sighs and sits down. \"You didn't tell me you were coming to visit.\" \"We're sorry for imposing on you,\" Amphitrite offers an apologetic smile. \"But our home has been invaded.\" \"Invaded?!\" Hades jumps to his feet. \"Who dares invade the realm of a god?\" \"Nymphs.\" Poseidon nods seriously. \"Nymphs?\" Hades stares at his brother incredulously. \"Mm hmm,\" Poseidon takes a sip from his goblet before answering. \"Demeter froze the lakes and rivers so now all the nymphs have fled to my realm and they won't leave me alone.\" \"We barely made it out alive,\" Amphitrite adds. \"They chased us all the way to the River Styx.\" \"It's a good thing they're all afraid of you.\" Poseidon says. Hades rubs his temples tiredly. \"So you're here because you want me to protect you from nymphs?\" \"Yes!\" Poseidon claps his hands together shamelessly. \"It's your mother-in-law's fault in the first place. No offense.\" He waves at Persephone. \"None taken,\" she says. \"Mother's always been a bit dramatic.\" Hades snorts into his plate, \"a bit?\" Persephone kicks him under the table. And thus begins a new tradition. Persephone returns to the Underworld at the end of summer and Poseidon and Amphitrite come to stay for a month when Demeter freezes the rivers. But of course wherever Poseidon's concerned things always manage to become unnecessarily difficult to deal with. \"The ferry is blocked again, your majesty,\" Charon sighs. \"By nymphs.\" Hades storms into the guest chambers that Poseidon had converted into a games room because, \"It's so dreadfully boring down here\" and, \"Imagine the fun we'll have, brother!\" His brother was currently teaching Persephone how to gamble. \"The trick is to wear as many layers of clothing as possible, that way your opponent will be naked before you've even lost your second cloak.\" \"Poseidon!\" \"Hello, have you finished working already?\" \"No, do you want to why?\" Hades grinds the sentence through clenched teeth as he stalks to Poseidon slowly. Poseidon gulps and inches away. \"Can't say I'm interested.\" Hades grabs his collar before he can escape. \"Your nymphs are blocking the entrance again!\" he yells in Poseidon's face. \"Fix it!\" \"I can't go out there!\" Poseidon's voice is high and boyish, panicked. \"They'll maul me! I'll never see my wife again!\" \"Go or I will make you go.\" \"Please Hades, you can make them leave. Just growl at them like last time. Don't make me go, brother, please.\" Poseidon face has transformed to one of a pleading child and Hades bites back a heavy sigh because he knows he doesn't have it in him to force his little brother into the fray. He releases Poseidon's collar, runs a hand through his tangled hair, and readies himself to battle the lovesick nymphs. Whoever says Hades isn't a saint has clearly never spent time with Poseidon. It's raining again. She loves the rain; the smell of it as it washes the world clean; the sound of it splashing, playing, like a child's hurried steps as he runs to his parents, like heartbeats. She loves the rain, a pure, unconditional love. She loves to dance in it, let it sit in her hair and slide across her skin. She used to love him like she loves the rain. He wishes she still did. It's raining again. He sits on the uncovered balcony and lets the rain wash him and hopes maybe now he'll be clean enough for her. He lets the rain drown him and thinks maybe when he opens his eyes she'll be there. He's drenched and shivering and the cold seeps into his ears and his nose and his fingernails. It crawls up his veins and sits in the hollow ribcage where his heart used to be, his heart that he tried to rip out and serve to her on a silver platter but it was too late and she was gone so he shredded it instead, tore it up because it was useless anyways. And he can't even spare a moment to care because he's unable to stop watching the rain. Every drop is a pretty sparkle in her eye, glowing, captivating. He's mesmerised. Downstairs he hears his children calling, \"Come inside father it's much too cold\" \"Aren't you bored out there by yourself?\" Not bored, not with the lovely raindrops dancing before his eyes, perhaps a little lonely though. Definitely lonely. His children don't understand, \"Isn't this what you wanted? You're free.\" He supposes he did, once upon a time, when she still loved him but he was too self-involved to love her back, when her jealousy consumed her and he would leave her for days to seek comfort from another. He didn't realise then how stifling freedom could be, how much it would drain from his soul and how it would gnaw on his sanity until there was nothing left but bits of bloodied flesh that only she could heal. But she's not here anymore and he knows he can't blame her for it but he does because he misses her so much and she doesn't love him anymore. And she's been gone for so long he thinks she must have forgotten him, an unsavory memory, faded and ripped at the corners. But he will never forget her or the way she smiled when she was truly, truly happy or how she loved the rain. And he's sure she must be watching the sky now, wherever she is, because it's raining again. So he draws lightning, stark, white, bright across black clouds and hopes she sees him and hopes, maybe, she'll remember. There are a lot of things Athena dislikes about Ares. She has a list of them, long and detailed and peppered with notes of her personal grievances with the only person who can make her lose her usual prudence. At the very top of this list is his utter lack of respect for rules. She's confronted him many a time, listing reasons and citing examples, but she may as well have been lecturing a sack of rocks so stubborn was he. The only rule that she's ever seen him follow, obey almost obsessively, is the unspoken one that Hera teaches to all her children, love Hephaestus. And still Ares manages to make a foul... She runs into him in the halls. Athena's searching for Hephaestus and Ares is slinking out of Aphrodite's room. She knows what has happened even before she smells his sister-in-law's perfume on him like a shroud of miasma. They look at each other for a long time, his face is haggard and weary and for once she has nothing to say. He lifts his hand, looks as if he's reaching for her. She decides then to have Hermes deliver her message and leaves Ares alone in the hallway... She finds herself studying Ares as intently as a lost traveler studies a map. She observes his wavering confidence when Hephaestus responds to him with one word answers and silent nods. She sees him steel himself against the criticism, sees him let his sisters pick him apart for what he's done, sees him break under Hephaestus' acceptance. Athena wonders if she's the only one who sees Ares bleed when his brother distances himself from him... \"I thought she was you.\" He's drunk, slumped over her door, and Athena thinks if he were wounded at this very moment he would bleed alcohol. \"Oh Ares.\" She helps him over to the bed and lays his head on her lap. Ares grips her hand tightly; his eyes are glassy but focused only on her. \"I thought she was you.\" Athena strokes his hair until he falls asleep... \"I don't hate him,\" Hephaestus tells her when she finally finds a chance to speak to him. \"I could never hate him.\" \"Perhaps you should tell him that.\".. She's just leaving the throne room when Hermes barrels in. \"Ares has been wounded!\" Athena's never run so fast in her life... \"I'm sorry,\" Ares croaks into his brother's shoulder. \"I'm so sorry.\" \"I forgive you.\" Hephaestus says, adjusting the splint on Ares' injured leg. \"You don't have to spare my feelings...\" \"I'm not. I choose to forgive you Ares, I will always choose you.\" Hephaestus nudges Ares' forehead. \"You're my favorite brother you know.\" Athena listens behind the door, and smiles... They resume their usual bickering when Ares' leg heals. His arrogance makes her want to pull her hair out and her life lessons drive him insane. They argue all the way from the throne room to her chambers, about mortals and philosophy and Dionysus' newest fling. He holds open all the doors for her. She kisses his cheek before saying goodnight. It doesn't take long for the tales to reach Zeus, he latches on to any news of Hera like a dying man to life. The stories are fantastical and he doesn't want to believe them at first. A blind man who can carve Hera's likeness into marble can only be a hoax, the lies of a swindler trying to peddle his goods. But when Hermes returns with one of the exquisite sculptures Zeus knows he has to see this man, speak with him, ask him about his muse. \"I was born blind you know,\" the sculptor says. His fingers dance across cool marble, mapping its surface. Zeus is quiet, watching the man in front of him, a boy really, too young, but the air around him is charged with static; there's magic in his fingertips. \"Tell me about your sculptures.\" The man stills. \"My sculptures,\" he smiles and there's a bittersweet fondness in his voice. \"I see her in my dreams sometimes. There are colours in my dreams and light and she's there too.\" \"Dreams?\" \"Dreams, memories, both maybe.\" They lapse into silence and Zeus is impatient to know more, the man cannot see his frowning face but he can feel it in his bones, the tense sparks. \"The first dream, the very first one before the sculptures, she was crying. \"I was dying and she held me and there was blood on her face but she was glorious. And then I woke up and I had to make the sculpture, recreate her face, I was afraid I would forget it. \"Sometimes we're on a ship and we're laughing and telling each other stories, sometimes we're living together and we sit by the hearth at night and I kiss her.\" Zeus clenches his fists until his nails dig into his palms and his hands are warm and sticky with his blood but he lets the man continue because he needs to know. \"I think we were in love,\" the man says. \"I know I must have loved her.\" \"Do you love her now?\" \"Yes.\" Athena tried her best to sneak off unnoticed. Really she did, but Artemis is an excellent hunter... The twins have her cornered, circling her like vultures. \"You look very pretty today Athena.\" \"Why are you all dressed up?\" \"Are you going somewhere fancy?\" \"Where are you going?\" \"Can we come?\".. Hermes is the only one Eris tells, mostly because she needs a favour... \"You want me to steal Dionysus' newest concoction?\" \"Yes.\" \"What's in it for me?\".. Dionysus gets suspicious when Heracles tries to stall him... \"You're hiding something from me aren't you?\" \"What? No...\" Heracles is an awful liar... Ares raises his eyebrow when he sees Artemis and Apollo skipping down the path behind Athena. \"I tried to lose them I swear.\".. \"How could you decide to throw a party without me?\" Dionysus wails, dragging Heracles by the collar with one hand and shaking Hermes with the other. \"It's not a party,\" Eris huffs, stomping her foot. \"It's a dinner and you're not invited!\".. \"We promise to behave.\" Apollo squeezes himself between Ares and Athena to throw his arms around the war god's shoulders. \"I even got us a main course!\" Artemis waves a string of ducks in front of Athena's face... \"Please, please, please, please, please!\" Dionysus clings onto Eileithyia's legs dramatically. \"Why did you bring him?\" \"We didn't do it on purpose, he just wouldn't go away.\".. The construction on Hephaestus' new house had officially wrapped up yesterday. The morning was spent moving furniture and settling in, thoroughly exhausted, he was looking forward to spending a quiet evening with his lovely Aglaea. Instead... \"A house warming dinner,\" Hebe says, pushing past him to walk inside. His living room is invaded in seconds. \"Oh neat! Is that new?\" Apollo finds the decorative harp the moment he enters. Dionysus' arms are full of jugs,.\"This one is made from red grapes, and this...\" \"Where do I put this?\" Artemis asks loudly, swinging her ducks in the air. Hermes kicks off his boots and sprawls out over the space of two chairs. Hephaestus turns to glare at Eris, for this could only be one of her ideas. \"Congratulations! Your new house is amazing!\" She pulls him into a hug and leans up to kiss his cheek and Hephaestus' irritation ebbs away as he lifts his little sister off the floor. \"Thank you Eris.\"",

      "Still, he distances himself from his brother just a bit and spends a little more time in his forge and his creations have never been more spectacular.",
      "Eris breaks into his workshop one day and hauls him into his chambers.",
      "\"We're going to a party,\" she announces, picking through his meager wardrobe.",
      "Eileithyia comes in with two attendants and shoves him, work gear and all, into the bathwater.",
      "They spend an hour primping and polishing, Hebe enters with a stack of new robes because, \"You have two robes Hephaestus.",
      "Two.",
      "How is that even possible?\" Eris asks.",
      "Eileithyia sits him in front of the mirror and he is pleasantly surprised.",
      "\"We had to drag that over from Aphrodite's room,\" Eileithyia says, \"I couldn't even find a reflective surface in here.\"",
      "Of course she couldn't, he's made sure of that; Hephaestus despises his reflection.",
      "Eris orders one of the attendants to return the floor length mirror and tugs Hephaestus from his chair.",
      "\"Hurry up.\"",
      "The mirror is too heavy and the flustered attendant stumbles and finds herself blinking wide eyes in Hephaestus' lap.",
      "\"I...I'm so sorry my lord!\"",
      "A lovely crimson blush staining her cheeks.",
      "Hephaestus laughs, \"it's alright my dear.\"",

      "\"I'll move that later.",
      "I imagine you would want to ready yourself for the party...\" \"Aglaea,\" she supplies.",
      "\"Aglaea, a beautiful name for a beautiful girl,\" Hephaestus smiles.",
      "\"Go prepare yourself and enjoy the party.\"",
      "Hebe and Eileithyia share a look as they usher him out the door.",
      "\"You are quite the charmer brother,\" Eris says slyly.",
      "\"What do you mean?\" Hephaestus asks obliviously.",
      "The party is splendid and Hephaestus even dances with Hebe despite his leg.",
      "Dionysus has just received the year's offering of wine and he is eager to share.",
      "\"Have a drink Hephaestus, you work too much.\"",
      "Hephaestus is happy and laughing, he's swaying with Eileithyia and maybe kind of just a little bit drunk.",

      "Oblivious, Hephaestus greets her in the halls and even makes her a necklace for her birthday.",
      "\"It's beautiful,\" Aglaea's eyes sparkle with awe and admiration and perhaps a little bit of something more.",
      "\"A beautiful gift for a beautiful girl,\" Hephaestus smiles obliviously.",
      "Aphrodite comes to his bed that night but Hephaestus finds himself strangely unaffected by her nakedness.",
      "She destroys half his room and tells him it's embarrassing to watch him court his whore.",
      "\"You are just like your father!\"",
      "She spits.",

      "The nightingale tilts her head and hops onto his shoulder.",
      "\"I'll tell you what you should do,\" she chirps brightly.",
      "\"Oh?\" Hephaestus raises his eyebrow.",
      "\"Pick the one that makes you smile,\" the nightingale says simply.",
      "\"The one that makes you happy.\"",
      "\"It's not that easy...\" \"Of course it is!\"",
      "The nightingale nips his ear.",

      "\"I came at an inopportune moment, and to think I was going to ask to court you at such a time...\" \"What?\"",
      "\"I'm sorry...\" \"No,\" Aglaea is breathless, excited.",
      "\"You want to court me?\"",
      "She asks.",
      "\"Yes, but if...\" \"Yes!\"",

      "Hephaestus is angry and vengeful and he has bound his mother to her throne.",
      "The gods are begging him to release their queen but he is immovable.",
      "Aphrodite watches, fascinated, as he takes on an army of shining gods, this creature, so damaged he has nothing to lose.",
      "And she wants to feel sympathy for him, this pitiful man, but all she feels is betrayal and hatred because he's demanding her hand as payment and they're agreeing.",
      "She curses them all as Hephaestus hauls her over his shoulder and carries her off the mountain.",
      "The second time Aphrodite meets Hephaestus they are sitting across from each other in his little room, she on the bed and he on the floor resting his aching leg.",
      "He apologises to her over and over.",

      "And she feels her heart flutter just a little but Aphrodite is still stinging from betrayal so she tells him in her coldest voice that he's unworthy and watches the hope crumble off his face.",
      "She doesn't see much of him after that.",
      "Hephaestus pours himself into his work and leaves her to do as she pleases.",
      "Not a week into their marriage Aphrodite takes a lover.",
      "She flaunts it to spite him and takes pleasure when he averts his eyes and slinks away.",
      "The feeling is fleeting and quickly replaced with a heaviness she cannot define but Aphrodite ignores it the best she can and dedicates herself to frivolity.",
      "Hephaestus is polite to her and ever respectful and she hates him for it because she can see him swimming in heartache, but retaliation never comes.",
      "She jeers and sneers and taunts and finally he tells her, \"I'm not my parents,\" he says.",

      "Aphrodite spies on them from her hiding spot behind the door and sees her husband smile for the first time.",
      "He's beautiful when he smiles, a tragic kind of beauty wrought from a lifetime of pain and unhappiness and Aphrodite's not quite sure when she developed this urge to protect him, hide him from the world.",
      "She stops taking lovers, spends her time instead, cataloguing his expressions and trying to gather the courage to tell him, tell him...what?",
      "She's not sure.",
      "She doesn't know what to do to get him to stop avoiding her, stop averting his eyes, look at me, look at me!",
      "And the one time she does manage to make him smile, it's small and sad and painful.",

      "The real Hephaestus finds them in the morning.",
      "The fourth time Aphrodite meets Hephaestus he is surrounded by a laughing crowd.",
      "They're singing and dancing and Hephaestus is smiling.",
      "Aphrodite feels her heart beat faster and her cheeks grow warmer, she smoothes her skirts and steps forward only for Hebe to steal his attention away.",
      "And she's confused by the glare Hebe throws at her until she sees Eileithyia not so subtly push he husband into Aglaea.",
      "Aphrodite has never felt a jealousy so strong.",
      "It cuts through her like a thousand swords, she's angry at Hephaestus and his sisters, but most of all she's angry at Aglaea, this stupid little fool, nowhere near as beautiful as herself, has made her husband laugh.",
      "She watches their friendship grow with a critical eye, watches as another woman falls head over heels in love with her husband, watches her dear Hephaestus slip away from her.",
      "And she knows she has no one but herself to blame but she still assigns Aglaea the most unpleasant tasks to perform.",
      "The fifth time Aphrodite meets Hephaestus he's holding her hand and giving her a bittersweet smile.",
      "She's lost him forever and there's nothing else she can do, so she lets her fingertips remember the pattern of calluses on his palm and accepts the very last gift he'll ever give her.",

      "She doesn't go to Hephaestus' wedding.",
      "She wants to say she's happy for him but she can't.",
      "And even in a room full of lovers, Aphrodite is solitary.",

      "The nymphs gather to gossip and laugh at the wayward girl and as punishment Demeter freezes their rivers and lakes.",
      "And so Poseidon's palace is packed with refugees hoping to earn the favour of the notorious god.",
      "They flock to the throne room and the halls outside his chambers, hair tousled seductively and dressed to the nines, but the king is nowhere to be found.",
      "Indeed his presence has been missing for days and the queen's rooms have been equally silent.",
      "\"What do you mean he's not coming?!\"",
      "Zeus' roar has the ground shaking and Hermes dodging to avoid his spittle.",
      "\"If Poseidon's not coming then I believe this meeting is adjourned.\"",
      "Hades says, gesturing for an attendant to retrieve his cloak.",
      "\"Now if you'll excuse me, my wife is waiting.\"",
      "Hermes is quick to follow and the room is emptied in seconds.",
      "Zeus, idle on his throne and stewing in anger, decides to pay his brother a visit.",
      "The seas are frigid and the air is thick with falling snow but Amphitrite insists on walking barefoot.",
      "Poseidon trails behind her, one hand swinging her winter boots and the other poised to catch her should she fall.",
      "Amphitrite hops from rock to icy rock wholly unaware of the mini heart attacks she is giving her husband as she balances herself on the slippery surface.",
      "Today Poseidon's path of penance has brought them to the shores of Troy.",
      "\"Poseidon,\" she calls, arms reaching for him, lips forming a delectable pout.",
      "\"I'm cold.\"",
      "He gathers her to his chest, brushing the snow off her shoulders and out of her hair.",
      "Amphitrite burrows her hands inside his cloak, chilly fingertips skimming his skin.",
      "She leans into him, flicking her tongue against his Adam's apple and kissing the curve of his jaw.",
      "\"Amphitrite,\" he moans, skin blazing under her touch.",
      "\"Down.\"",
      "She says, and he bends to accommodate her height.",
      "Her kisses glide up the side of his neck exquisitely slow.",
      "She stops to nibble his ear and her fingers trace abstract patterns across his chest.",
      "His blood is heating and his pulse is racing and it takes all his self control to not tear at her skirts.",
      "Amphitrite grins and presses her hips against him.",
      "\"Shall we return to our room?\"",
      "He manages to stutter between laboured breaths.",
      "\"No,\" she's already tugging on his robes.",
      "\"Here.\"",
      "\"Poseidon!\"",
      "Poseidon lets out a grunt of frustration and draws his little wife further into his cloak as he looks up at his brother.",
      "\"What?!\"",
      "He growls.",
      "\"Why are you neglecting your duties and wasting your time here frolicking in the snow?\" Amphitrite squeaks indignantly from Poseidon's chest and in defiance, presses her palm against the prominent bulge between her husband's legs.",
      "Poseidon fights down a groan, his vision is blinded by a pleasurable haze and he grips Amphtrite's waist tightly as Zeus continues his lecture.",
      "\"What do you have to say for yourself?\"",
      "\"Go away!\"",
      "Poseidon practically begs when Amphitrite grinds her hand on him.",
      "\"Not until you explain yourself!\"",
      "Poseidon almost wails in despair as Amphitrite grasps him with both hands.",
      "\"Room?\" he asks her, voice straining, sweat beading on his brow.",
      "\"Anywhere with locks.\"",
      "They're gone in a pretty swirl of heavy snow.",
      "No one wants to play with Zeus today.",
      "The snow ravaged land is still and barren.",
      "The birds have long gone but Hades' keen eyes spy a curious set of nightingale tracks circling the base of a tree.",
      "He had been on his way home when he heard the bird's song, a familiar voice calling his name.",
      "\"Hades,\" the nightingale chirps.",
      "\"Hello Hades.\"",
      "She peeks at him from snow shrouded branches.",
      "Hades kneels down and offers his hand.",
      "\"It's been a long time, sister.\"",
      "She hops onto his finger and catches his sleeve in her beak, pulling it around herself and nestling comfortably in the warm fabric.",
      "Hades settles himself under the tree and they sit together in silence, relishing the quiet companionship.",
      "Finally Hades says, \"Hephaestus has remarried.\"",
      "\"I know.",

      "\"You were there?\"",

      "She eyes him intently.",
      "\"Where do those people go when they die?\"",
      "She asks the question with an intensity that startles him and it takes Hades a couple beats to recover.",
      "\"I don't know,\" he tells her, shaking his head.",
      "\"Why do you ask?\"",
      "The nightingale deflates, dropping her head and dragging her wings.",
      "Hades can feel himself suffocating under a thick blanket of overwhelming sadness, \"Hera?\"",
      "She looks up and he can see the weariness in her eyes, sorrow and exhaustion sitting heavy on her mind and he wonders if she's ever once slept while she was away.",
      "\"Tell me,\" he says and waits patiently as she gathers her thoughts.",
      "What a strange sight it must have been, the dark hulking king of the underworld cradling a tiny bird in his hands, head bent and listening closely as she chattered away.",
      "Hera tells him how she found acceptance, a mentor and a lover, how they were ripped away from her, and how she grieved.",
      "She tells him about Papa Muhammad and Mama Marah and Khurram.",
      "She tells him about Neela.",
      "\"They didn't know who I was.",
      "They didn't know anything about any of us.",
      "Where do you think Neela went?\"",
      "\"I don't know.\"",

      "She says.",
      "\"Her death is not your fault.\"",
      "\"I taught her magic.\"",
      "She buries her head in his sleeve.",
      "Hades sighs, he never once won an argument against Hera.",
      "\"Am I a sinner?\" her voice is muffled.",
      "\"Why do I kill all the things I touch?\"",
      "\"You are not a sinner, sister.\"",
      "\"Are you sure?\" Hades pats her head lightly with his finger.",
      "\"You are my precious little sister, the one who asked for stories and pulled on my hair until I let her sit on my shoulders.",
      "She could never be a sinner.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" the nightingale says, climbing on his shoulder.",
      "There is silence again, just a brother and a sister watching the snow together.",
      "\"How is Agapios?\"",
      "She asks him hesitantly.",
      "\"He has bathed in Lethe and returned to the mortal world.\"",
      "She nods solemnly.",
      "\"Do you wish to find him?\"",
      "\"I wish for his happiness.\"",
      "Hera tugs on a lock of his hair and pecks Hades on his brow, an imitation of a kiss.",
      "\"Goodbye brother,\" she chirps, taking flight.",
      "\"Goodbye.\"",
      "\"I don't understand,\" Persephone says to her husband.",
      "\"Are we having a party?\" Hades had barely stepped through the door when he was accosted by his wife.",
      "\"What party?\"",
      "He asks, taking off his cloak.",
      "Persephone grabs his hand and leads him to the dining hall, rarely used for the couple preferred to take their meals in bed.",
      "The table was piled high with plates; Hades could barely see Poseidon's head behind a tower of fruit.",
      "\"Hello brother,\" Poseidon waves at him cheerfully.",
      "\"We started dinner without you.\"",
      "Hades raises his eyebrow at Persephone who shrugs and takes a seat beside Amphitrite.",
      "He sighs and sits down.",
      "\"You didn't tell me you were coming to visit.\"",
      "\"We're sorry for imposing on you,\" Amphitrite offers an apologetic smile.",
      "\"But our home has been invaded.\"",
      "\"Invaded?!\"",
      "Hades jumps to his feet.",
      "\"Who dares invade the realm of a god?\" \"Nymphs.\"",
      "Poseidon nods seriously.",
      "\"Nymphs?\" Hades stares at his brother incredulously.",
      "\"Mm hmm,\" Poseidon takes a sip from his goblet before answering.",
      "\"Demeter froze the lakes and rivers so now all the nymphs have fled to my realm and they won't leave me alone.\"",
      "\"We barely made it out alive,\" Amphitrite adds.",
      "\"They chased us all the way to the River Styx.\"",
      "\"It's a good thing they're all afraid of you.\"",
      "Poseidon says.",
      "Hades rubs his temples tiredly.",
      "\"So you're here because you want me to protect you from nymphs?\"",
      "\"Yes!\"",
      "Poseidon claps his hands together shamelessly.",
      "\"It's your mother-in-law's fault in the first place.",
      "No offense.\"",
      "He waves at Persephone.",
      "\"None taken,\" she says.",
      "\"Mother's always been a bit dramatic.\"",
      "Hades snorts into his plate, \"a bit?\" Persephone kicks him under the table.",
      "And thus begins a new tradition.",
      "Persephone returns to the Underworld at the end of summer and Poseidon and Amphitrite come to stay for a month when Demeter freezes the rivers.",
      "But of course wherever Poseidon's concerned things always manage to become unnecessarily difficult to deal with.",
      "\"The ferry is blocked again, your majesty,\" Charon sighs.",
      "\"By nymphs.\"",
      "Hades storms into the guest chambers that Poseidon had converted into a games room because, \"It's so dreadfully boring down here\" and, \"Imagine the fun we'll have, brother!\"",

      "\"Poseidon!\"",
      "\"Hello, have you finished working already?\"",
      "\"No, do you want to why?\" Hades grinds the sentence through clenched teeth as he stalks to Poseidon slowly.",
      "Poseidon gulps and inches away.",
      "\"Can't say I'm interested.\"",
      "Hades grabs his collar before he can escape.",
      "\"Your nymphs are blocking the entrance again!\"",
      "he yells in Poseidon's face.",
      "\"Fix it!\"",
      "\"I can't go out there!\"",
      "Poseidon's voice is high and boyish, panicked.",

      "\"Go or I will make you go.\"",
      "\"Please Hades, you can make them leave.",
      "Just growl at them like last time.",
      "Don't make me go, brother, please.\"",
      "Poseidon face has transformed to one of a pleading child and Hades bites back a heavy sigh because he knows he doesn't have it in him to force his little brother into the fray.",
      "He releases Poseidon's collar, runs a hand through his tangled hair, and readies himself to battle the lovesick nymphs.",
      "Whoever says Hades isn't a saint has clearly never spent time with Poseidon.",
      "It's raining again.",
      "She loves the rain; the smell of it as it washes the world clean; the sound of it splashing, playing, like a child's hurried steps as he runs to his parents, like heartbeats.",
      "She loves the rain, a pure, unconditional love.",
      "She loves to dance in it, let it sit in her hair and slide across her skin.",
      "She used to love him like she loves the rain.",
      "He wishes she still did.",
      "It's raining again.",
      "He sits on the uncovered balcony and lets the rain wash him and hopes maybe now he'll be clean enough for her.",
      "He lets the rain drown him and thinks maybe when he opens his eyes she'll be there.",
      "He's drenched and shivering and the cold seeps into his ears and his nose and his fingernails.",
      "It crawls up his veins and sits in the hollow ribcage where his heart used to be, his heart that he tried to rip out and serve to her on a silver platter but it was too late and she was gone so he shredded it instead, tore it up because it was useless anyways.",
      "And he can't even spare a moment to care because he's unable to stop watching the rain.",
      "Every drop is a pretty sparkle in her eye, glowing, captivating.",
      "He's mesmerised.",
      "Downstairs he hears his children calling, \"Come inside father it's much too cold\" \"Aren't you bored out there by yourself?\" Not bored, not with the lovely raindrops dancing before his eyes, perhaps a little lonely though.",
      "Definitely lonely.",
      "His children don't understand, \"Isn't this what you wanted?",
      "You're free.\"",
      "He supposes he did, once upon a time, when she still loved him but he was too self-involved to love her back, when her jealousy consumed her and he would leave her for days to seek comfort from another.",
      "He didn't realise then how stifling freedom could be, how much it would drain from his soul and how it would gnaw on his sanity until there was nothing left but bits of bloodied flesh that only she could heal.",
      "But she's not here anymore and he knows he can't blame her for it but he does because he misses her so much and she doesn't love him anymore.",
      "And she's been gone for so long he thinks she must have forgotten him, an unsavory memory, faded and ripped at the corners.",
      "But he will never forget her or the way she smiled when she was truly, truly happy or how she loved the rain.",
      "And he's sure she must be watching the sky now, wherever she is, because it's raining again.",
      "So he draws lightning, stark, white, bright across black clouds and hopes she sees him and hopes, maybe, she'll remember.",
      "There are a lot of things Athena dislikes about Ares.",
      "She has a list of them, long and detailed and peppered with notes of her personal grievances with the only person who can make her lose her usual prudence.",
      "At the very top of this list is his utter lack of respect for rules.",
      "She's confronted him many a time, listing reasons and citing examples, but she may as well have been lecturing a sack of rocks so stubborn was he.",

    "text": "Contrary to his brother's beliefs he does visit earth. Of course it's only when his duties allow it, and only for a few moments, (if only to feel the sun on his back for a few spare moments). It is in one of these instances that he sees her: the goddesses of spring. Swathed in pink she wades in the grass, ignorant of his presence as she collects flowers and holds them in her skirts. He opens his mouth to call out to her; to alert her of his presence, but then her hair flashes in the sun: kissed by fire. His voice catches in his throat. When she finally sees him, he sees as her cheeks pale, and watches as she looks back at the path she had taken. Perhaps she was looking for Arya, or one of her nymph companions? '' Please,'' he finally calls out, '' I mean you no harm.'' He sees her fingers tremble as she grips her skirts tighter and takes small steps toward him. He smiled. What a brave girl- not many immortals, or mortals for that matter, would venture near him. '' Hello.'' She says. The goddess carefully sits next to him, wary not to crush the flowers that lay across her lap. '' Good day, my lady Sansa.'' His voice is soft, as to not startle the poor thing. ''Good day lord Jon.'' Her voice is equally soft. He could practically feel her trembling. This goddess may be beautiful, but she was nothing more than a girl, and he thought her mother must have raised her as docile as a doe. She does not meet his eyes, this gentle rose that Catelyn has groomed in her fields, and with a sigh he realizes that she would probably not talk to him. '' Excuse me, my lady I have my duties to attend to.'' With a quick move he sweeps up a hand and kisses it. He briefly sees her eyes widen, but it is not enough to not make him go, for he spies Arya's wolves running up the path. It would not do to been seen by the huntress, less she tell Catelyn that she spotted the lord of the Underworld with her daughter. When he visits the upper world again she is there. It seems as if she has not moved from the very spot, but he knows she must have. She could not be waiting for him, surely? The thought makes his heart clench. He thinks of turning back, but how foolish would that be- the king of the Underworld turned away by a mere maid- how his brother's would laugh. Jon sighs before sitting himself next to her, determined to enjoy his time spent on earth. '' Hello my lady Sansa.'' Sansa stops humming and the half finished garland is placed on her lap. She graces him with a small smile. '' Hello Lord Jon.'' He wishes he could find the right words in which to speak to her, but for all her kindness she is still a mystery to him. A warm hand touches his. He almost reels back, but he sees then the pleading look in her eyes. '' My mother forbids it...but perhaps you could tell me about the time before you ruled- about the Targaeryns?'' He shudders at the name and feels the warmth of her hand leave his. For just a few moments he is lost in his memories of that time- fiery and dark things without rest. It makes him weary. '' Those are not pleasant tales.'' He murmurs. '' No one else will tell me, and I no longer wish to be ignorant.'' Her voice is not soft anymore, but determined- determined to face him. '' Very well.'' Day after day he comes to earth to tell tales to Sansa under the shade of an Olive tree. They start with the tales of his father- of the Targaeryns. Then they dissolve into tales of Ghost as a pup. He tells her of the souls Sam has ferried: the young, the old, kings, heroes- he tells her the tales they have told him. He cannot explain the feeling that comes over him when he makes her laugh. Jon starts to dread leaving her- starts to miss the warmth of her when he sits upon his throne. Sansa gives him an Asphodel flower, '' to plant in your meadows, '' she tells him. He looks at the long stemmed flower and thinks of the graying meadows where the dead roam, and no light reaches. ''I don't think it-'' ''It will grow.'' He plants the flower himself and watches in amazement as the once barren fields sprout stem after stem of the wild flower. In return he gives her a rose: a thing made of Sapphires and Peridots, twisted with silver. ''It's lovely.'' She tells him, and he can feel his cheeks redden when she gives him a kiss on the cheek, and twists the ornament in her hair. The truth of it is that she falls into his kingdom- tumbles really, and when he feels her enter he rushes to her. He does not find her reaching and crying out to her mother, but instead, she is calmly waiting for him, clutching a Daffodil in her hand. '' I fell.'' She says simply. He helps her from where she sits. '' Are you hurt?'' He touches the side of her face with gentle fingers. Icy orbs meet his as she leans into his touch- her hand coming to curl around his own until she intertwines their fingers. '' No, I am quite unscathed.'' She insists that he show her his kingdom. So he leads her by the hand and shows her his quiet kingdom, always aware of how she takes everything in. Soon, she lets go of his hand and starts to weave herself among the meadows- making the souls dance long forgotten steps, as she twirls among them. Jon's breathe hitches when she smiles, and he reminds himself that she cannot stay here- he must give her back. With each passing day he reminds himself, but then it is so easy to forget. Sansa makes it so easy to forget. She charms Sam and reduces Ghost to a puppy, and everyday he thinks himself a little more in love her. Rickon comes to him, the fluttering of his wings echoing in the throne room, '' Catelyn is distraught Jon- nothing grows now that she has made it winter.'' Rickon's eyes meet Sansa's and then flick back to Jon's. '' She must return. Your brother commands it'' Jon sighs, his shoulders hunched, '' Very well.'' He does not meet her eyes as Rickon holds out his hand expectantly. He does not see the tears that gather in her eyes. ''Please,'' he hears her plead, '' may I just stay one more day?'' Jon's hands clench at he stares disbelievingly at the woman before him. Why was she doing this? Could she really- he mentally shakes himself from his thoughts and watches as Rickon grins. '' I suppose your mother can wait another day.'' Sansa straightens and smiles sweetly, '' Thank you.'' '' Do you want me to go?'' Sansa cups his cheeks, her eyes searching for an answer. He wants to say yes. He wants to tell her to leave- to leave him alone, and to never return to this place because she does not deserve this place. She is light and air, spring and warmth- she does not deserve such a dismal existence. ''No.'' Lips brush his as he gathers her to him, and he thinks that this is his most selfish act. '' Thank you.'' Her words are no more than a whisper- warm and inviting, even as she plucks the fruit from his palm. She is spring personified: hair copper and fire even in the darkness of the Underworld, with lips and cheeks pink, and skin sun kissed from her days in her mother's fields. A smile graces her features as she eats one seed after the other: six in all. With fingers and lips stained scarlet she pulls him into a kiss- her eyes now full and bright. She does not even realize when the pomegranate tumbles from her hand onto her dress- staining the ivory garment with red. Catelyn is less than pleased with him. He can ignore her though, as long as Sansa returns to him- as long as she greets him with a smile and a kiss: clothed in an amethyst gown and an iron crown encrusted with rubies, flowers trailing behind her. That is all he desires.",

    "text": "Of all the things Persephone misses, it is the sun she misses most. In the misty darkness of the Underworld, she cannot trace bright Helios's journey across the sky, cannot feel the warm touch of his rays upon her skin. She does not regret her choice, the moment when she grasped an outstretched hand and followed Hades into his shadowed kingdom, but she is a being of Spring, and she yearns for the sun. She does not tell Hades. She loves him, loves his twilight realm, and for them she would sacrifice even the sun. But all the love in her heart cannot deny her bone-deep need for light and warmth. Day by day, it gnaws at her, a vicious cold that takes root in her chest and settles heavy in her bones. She grows pale and thin, her body racked with shivers. She is a flower, withering away in the darkness. Until one night, Hades stretches out his hand once more and leads her down an unfamiliar hall. At last they stop before a dark room, and his hand comes up to cup her cheek. \"Persephone,\" he says softly, \"my Spring. You are so cold.\" Hades is her quiet suitor, the man who fell in love with a nameless, barefoot goddess tending wildflowers in an empty field. Innocent. His love for her she does not doubt, but it has always been chaste. Now, she stands before the darkness of his bedchamber, and does not hesitate. She grasps his hand and lets him lead her into the room. The flowing folds of her chiton part easily at his touch. He undresses her with quiet reverence, his hands sparking small fires where they brush her chilled skin. She shivers, and it is not from the cold. When she stands naked before him, he bears her gently down to the bed and settles himself between her thighs. Heat flares to life deep in her belly, an ember burning against the cold, and she gasps. He kisses her then, lips warm against hers and the warmth spreads like fire through her veins. She opens her mouth beneath his with a soft cry and returns his kiss. Her world narrowing to the feel of mouths and lips and tongue, she clings to him, lets the heat he stokes in her chase away the cold. An eternity later, he pulls away from her. She moans in protest, wanting more, until his fingers skim across her breast, ghost along the curve of her hip, and the fire building beneath her skin blazes at his touch. She arches into the contact, her hips bucking against his, and everything changes. There is no more lazy kissing, no more gentle touches, just the fierce pressure of his mouth on her lips, her jaw, her breast, just the sudden movement of his hips, just the hard length of him pressing against the throbbing pulse between her legs as he pushes slowly into her. She cries out as they move together, the heat building inside her unbearable, a sun trapped inside her skin, devouring her, white-hot and burning and oh-- Tangled together in the darkness of the bedchamber, Hades teaches her of a different kind of fire. She lies warm in his arms, and has no more need of the sun.",

    "text": "The bar was dark, and smelt of sweat and vomit. It was an above average bar, to say the least. The stools even looked like they had red cushions on them; a faded, dirty-in-a-stained-sort-of-way, but cushions none the less. Even so, the messenger decided to stand rather than sit when he ordered his drink. In all honesty, he never used to drink so much, when he was younger, but the Gods could be petty and annoying, and sometimes it was just fun to get shit-faced and have fun with a couple of mortals. Men, women, didn't really matter. It was all about the fun, really. The 70's were well and truly a god-send. However the clothing he was forced to wear definitely made him feel like an arse. There were far too many colours. Or too few. Take the women who sat beside him for instance. Her hair was unnaturally straight, and all black. Her eyes were surrounded with black, and her lips were coloured in the black. Black skirt, black shirt, black boots. Black, black, black. He knew that somewhere behind all the blackness was a woman searching for an identity. Perhaps once the all black get up went out of fashion she'd find it, but somehow he doubted that. She had the look on her as someone who would wander this earth for as long as she lived. His kind of woman. She caught him staring and just grimaced before looking back at her own glass. Everyone else may have thought it to be vodka with the faces she was pulling, but he knew water when he saw it. Also the actress. Maybe he'd marry this woman. Yes, in the next century perhaps, when she was a little more his age. He took another swig of his whiskey before he turned so that his whole body was facing her. She turned to look at him, and merely raised her eyebrow expectantly, boredom written across her face. \"You know it's hard to talk to a pretty girl like you when you look at me like I'm about to fail,\" he said, and smiled warily. He didn't know if he even had the energy to play this game with her. But he would try. He didn't like beautiful women to be lonely. \"And yet that hasn't seemed to deter you, old man,\" she replied cheekily, and went back to sipping her water. \"Most women would have asked if I really thought they were pretty,\" he said quickly. He knew the question was on her lips, but she was far too spirited to make it easy for him. \"Most men would only talk to me because they some weird kink.\" \"Clever girl. I hope that comes from observation and not experience, though.\" \"Why? D'you want me to be your perfect little virgin?\" \"God, no. I'd just hate for your sweet heart to be hardened by the perverse nature of this world.\" \"If you really believe that then you should stop talking to me.\" Hermes sighed. This woman sparked a fire within him. Not a sexual fire - though that was part of it - but a fire to fight back. She was clever and quick and just sarcastic enough for him to find her humorous. God, he wanted her. \"I understand,\" he said after a moment, and turned back to the bar and ordered another drink. He wasn't the type to push anyone, and he could tell that she would keep pushing til he shut his mouth, \"sorry to bother you, by the way.\" \"What?\" she asked, a little shocked at how easy he acquiesced to her request. \"I can understand if you want to be left alone. Most of the time I want to be left alone, trust me. I've got a big family, and they are all arseholes,\" he said, and downed his drink, \"but sometimes it's nice to be around like-minded people, you know?\" \"Yeah,\" she replied softly. \"Like you, for instance. No one will ever believe that you and I have anything in common, and on first impression, we don't. But if you really wanted to be left alone tonight, you wouldn't have acknowledged me at all.\" She had nothing to say to that and took another sip of her water. Hermes watched as her little pink tongue swiped across her black upper lip and he marvelled at the sudden contrast in colour. \"You wear all that dark make up, all the dark clothing, just so that no one will look at you. Just so that they'll leave you alone. But I know that under all that darkness there is a rose just waiting for someone to shine the sun on its petals so that it may bloom, bright and beautiful for all the world to see.\" He had gotten more impassioned by his speech than he meant to, and he coughed a little so that he could regain his composure. \"Sorry, I just let myself rattle,\" he said chuckling and looked down at his watch, \"And I have to deliver something in a few hours, but I don't see why I can't do it now.\" He pulled out a few bills from his pocket and placed them on the bar, smiling at the bartender, before making to leave. The woman's hand gripping onto his arm stopped him though. He looked up at her wide eyes and couldn't help the puzzled expression that slipped onto his face. Even more puzzling was when she hopped off the seat, cradled his head in her hands and kissed him for she was worth. The kiss was heated and eager and desperate. She managed to slip a soft whine somewhere in there as well - one which he'd barely heard over the loud music. \"Do you wanna have sex?\" she asked the second she'd stopped kissing him. He could barely formulate a reply, but she seemed to get his answer when she down to see what was digging into her stomach at this close proximity. Then he was dragged out of the bar and into this pick-up truck which seemed to belong to her. She drove them to the outskirts of town, in a secluded part of the forest, and for a moment he thought that she might be some sort of psycho killer. He wasn't all that worried - he couldn't actually get hurt - but it would put a damper on the erection that was being rubbed through his denim jeans by this woman. He still didn't know her name - though somehow he didn't think she cared that much. The next few moments were spent trying to get in the best position to have sex in a truck, whilst also trying to get his jeans down to her ankles and her panties anywhere but where they were. It was a little awkward, until she would ask him to tell her about the flower she was. \"A rose,\" he groaned when she finally impaled herself on her, \"a rose just waiting to be seen, to be touched.\" \"Yes, touch me,\" she whimpered and began riding him in earnest as he reached up underneath her shirt and bar to fondle her breast. And such soft breasts they were. \"It just need sunshine, just needs to be nurtured,\" he couldn't help but groan between his speech as she clenched her inner walls, \"Oh, and when it blooms it's - ah - it's so magical how it happens. To see it happen.\" Her panting became more rapid as did her thrusts against him. If she kept squeezing him like she was, this night would end very soon, and he didn't want that. His one hand left her breast, and instead he spread it over her abdomen so that his thumb brushed against her clit. She cried out, digging her fingernails into his shoulders, making him hiss from the sensations. She couldn't really hurt him, not unless he wanted her too. \"You just wanna bloom, don't you baby? You just want everyone to see how perfect you are?\" he rasped out. \"Yeah, yeah, just like that!\" He knew she was barely listening anymore, but it seemed to work. She came, cussing and shuddering. He came soon after, not even try to stop anymore, and thrust up into her with as much restraint as he could, scared she might hit her head on the roof. She rode out the waves slowly; a long lazy smile graced her lips. The black makeup was now smudged and dripping down her face with sweat, but she had yet to notice. He sat up slowly and held her to him for moment, before removing his shirt to begin wiping some of the smudges off. She just laughed at his attempts of gentleness, and they not so easily manoeuvred themselves back to their previous seats. He watched her, amazed at how different she looked as she wiped away all her make up with his shirt. She was still that same fiery woman from the bar, but at least now he could see her pale complexion and her rose petal lips. \"You really do need a bit of sunlight in your life, dear,\" he said, smiling broadly. She only shook her head and chuckled, and made to give him back his shirt. \"No, keep it, please. May you look at it and think of me often,\" he said quickly, \"Very, very often.\" She laughed again at the lecherous wink he threw at her, and started the car. When she looked back to ask him for his name, he was gone. She had heard no door, no shuffling. He was just simply gone. She looked down at his shirt and brought it up to her nose to sniff gingerly. Yes, she certainly would think of him often; very, very often.",
    "sentences": [
      "The bar was dark, and smelt of sweat and vomit.",
      "It was an above average bar, to say the least.",
      "The stools even looked like they had red cushions on them; a faded, dirty-in-a-stained-sort-of-way, but cushions none the less.",
      "Even so, the messenger decided to stand rather than sit when he ordered his drink.",
      "In all honesty, he never used to drink so much, when he was younger, but the Gods could be petty and annoying, and sometimes it was just fun to get shit-faced and have fun with a couple of mortals.",
      "Men, women, didn't really matter.",
      "It was all about the fun, really.",
      "The 70's were well and truly a god-send.",
      "However the clothing he was forced to wear definitely made him feel like an arse.",
      "There were far too many colours.",
      "Or too few.",
      "Take the women who sat beside him for instance.",
      "Her hair was unnaturally straight, and all black.",
      "Her eyes were surrounded with black, and her lips were coloured in the black.",
      "Black skirt, black shirt, black boots.",
      "Black, black, black.",
      "He knew that somewhere behind all the blackness was a woman searching for an identity.",
      "Perhaps once the all black get up went out of fashion she'd find it, but somehow he doubted that.",
      "She had the look on her as someone who would wander this earth for as long as she lived.",
      "His kind of woman.",
      "She caught him staring and just grimaced before looking back at her own glass.",
      "Everyone else may have thought it to be vodka with the faces she was pulling, but he knew water when he saw it.",
      "Also the actress.",
      "Maybe he'd marry this woman.",
      "Yes, in the next century perhaps, when she was a little more his age.",
      "He took another swig of his whiskey before he turned so that his whole body was facing her.",
      "She turned to look at him, and merely raised her eyebrow expectantly, boredom written across her face.",
      "\"You know it's hard to talk to a pretty girl like you when you look at me like I'm about to fail,\" he said, and smiled warily.",
      "He didn't know if he even had the energy to play this game with her.",
      "But he would try.",
      "He didn't like beautiful women to be lonely.",
      "\"And yet that hasn't seemed to deter you, old man,\" she replied cheekily, and went back to sipping her water.",
      "\"Most women would have asked if I really thought they were pretty,\" he said quickly.",
      "He knew the question was on her lips, but she was far too spirited to make it easy for him.",
      "\"Most men would only talk to me because they some weird kink.\"",
      "\"Clever girl.",
      "I hope that comes from observation and not experience, though.\"",
      "\"Why?",
      "D'you want me to be your perfect little virgin?\"",
      "\"God, no. I'd just hate for your sweet heart to be hardened by the perverse nature of this world.\"",
      "\"If you really believe that then you should stop talking to me.\"",
      "Hermes sighed.",
      "This woman sparked a fire within him.",
      "Not a sexual fire - though that was part of it - but a fire to fight back.",
      "She was clever and quick and just sarcastic enough for him to find her humorous.",
      "God, he wanted her.",
      "\"I understand,\" he said after a moment, and turned back to the bar and ordered another drink.",
      "He wasn't the type to push anyone, and he could tell that she would keep pushing til he shut his mouth, \"sorry to bother you, by the way.\"",
      "\"What?\" she asked, a little shocked at how easy he acquiesced to her request.",
      "\"I can understand if you want to be left alone.",
      "Most of the time I want to be left alone, trust me.",
      "I've got a big family, and they are all arseholes,\" he said, and downed his drink, \"but sometimes it's nice to be around like-minded people, you know?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" she replied softly.",
      "\"Like you, for instance.",
      "No one will ever believe that you and I have anything in common, and on first impression, we don't.",
      "But if you really wanted to be left alone tonight, you wouldn't have acknowledged me at all.\"",
      "She had nothing to say to that and took another sip of her water.",
      "Hermes watched as her little pink tongue swiped across her black upper lip and he marvelled at the sudden contrast in colour.",
      "\"You wear all that dark make up, all the dark clothing, just so that no one will look at you.",
      "Just so that they'll leave you alone.",
      "But I know that under all that darkness there is a rose just waiting for someone to shine the sun on its petals so that it may bloom, bright and beautiful for all the world to see.\"",
      "He had gotten more impassioned by his speech than he meant to, and he coughed a little so that he could regain his composure.",
      "\"Sorry, I just let myself rattle,\" he said chuckling and looked down at his watch, \"And I have to deliver something in a few hours, but I don't see why I can't do it now.\"",
      "He pulled out a few bills from his pocket and placed them on the bar, smiling at the bartender, before making to leave.",
      "The woman's hand gripping onto his arm stopped him though.",
      "He looked up at her wide eyes and couldn't help the puzzled expression that slipped onto his face.",
      "Even more puzzling was when she hopped off the seat, cradled his head in her hands and kissed him for she was worth.",
      "The kiss was heated and eager and desperate.",
      "She managed to slip a soft whine somewhere in there as well - one which he'd barely heard over the loud music.",
      "\"Do you wanna have sex?\" she asked the second she'd stopped kissing him.",
      "He could barely formulate a reply, but she seemed to get his answer when she down to see what was digging into her stomach at this close proximity.",
      "Then he was dragged out of the bar and into this pick-up truck which seemed to belong to her.",
      "She drove them to the outskirts of town, in a secluded part of the forest, and for a moment he thought that she might be some sort of psycho killer.",
      "He wasn't all that worried - he couldn't actually get hurt - but it would put a damper on the erection that was being rubbed through his denim jeans by this woman.",
      "He still didn't know her name - though somehow he didn't think she cared that much.",
      "The next few moments were spent trying to get in the best position to have sex in a truck, whilst also trying to get his jeans down to her ankles and her panties anywhere but where they were.",

    "text": "Even as you stare wide-eyed from disbelief, memories of your time spent with the god flash before your eyes like an old silent movie. You remember with unbelievable clarity when he appeared by your window, like something out of a dream. Had you known that it was not a dream, then perhaps your actions might have been more modest. As it happened, when he turned his lust filled gaze upon you, you could not help yourself but invite him to your bed. The god, Dionysus, was not as you expected. Or perhaps he was. His figure was lean and toned; pale skin taut across his muscles. Golden ringlets framed his smooth, unblemished face and his bright, child-like grin made your heart paced madly. The God of Madness he was, after all. Maybe when others ask you of the night that he held you in his arms as trembled from the sensations that racked your body. Oh, how his soft lips made you gasp. They were like rose petals ghosting over your skin, unlocking some wanton creature from the very pit of your tainted soul. Is that what you are now? A tainted woman? If that night had been a dream, then you would still be a clean, virtuous girl - and if it had not, did that somehow spoil the beauty of your emerald eyes? Did it crack your creamy complexion? Could others see what you had done? Did the truth shine from you like some satanic glow? All these thoughts go through your head as you see him lying naked in your bed. It had not been a dream, of this you a certain. The blush stained your cheeks and your neck, and you see how his eyes flit across you, tracking the movement of your blood. You ask him what he's doing here, in your bed chambers He says nothing but smiles and laughs melodically. Even something so simple as laughter drenches up memories of him, chuckling at your bashfulness, your inexperience. And then his hands, roaming across your body, calming your nerves yet heating your skin. \"I came to see you, my dear,\" he purrs out, and his eyes twinkle with mischief, \"I promised you I would.\" It is night time, and everyone in the house is asleep. Everyone but you. You could not sleep for fear of having sinful dreams yet again, and so wandered about trying not to think about how you gave up something that was declared to be precious to a complete stranger. \"Yes,\" you whisper out and shut the door behind you. When you do nothing but stand there, staring at him in fear, his easy grin fails and concern fills his face. He stands up to walk towards you, and you gasp in naive surprise as his erection bobs slightly. In an instant, very much like magic, he is suddenly clothed in a pale white loin cloth. You still see his arousal as clear as day, but your fear ebbs somewhat when you cannot actually see his arousal. \"I thought this was what you wanted, my darling?\" he whispered and placed soft, gentle hand on your arms. Your eyes close as the god's heat sinks into your skin like a calming balm, and you cannot help but sigh as the cold begins to leave your body. \"I thought I had dreamt it all,\" you say softly, suddenly afraid to open your eyes. What you did was sinful, and if you looked into his eyes you knew you would do it again and again and forever if he would allow it. And he would allow it. \"You had dreamt it, my dear,\" he said, chuckling slightly. \"But then how are you here if it was but a dream?\" You feel him tilt your head up and your eyelids slowly lift and you find yourself staring into his angelic blue eyes. His mouth is so close to your own, and you feel your body heat as he bites his lip playfully. \"Because I came to you in your dream, darling. I heard you cry out for me. Cry out for love and attention. I heard your wishes to fly away from this place.\" As he spoke softly to you, he began to place soft, chaste kisses on your face, but never on your lips. \"I came to you because you called, my love,\" a kiss on the chin, \"I will always come when you call, my dear,\" a kiss underneath the ear, \"Forever, my darling.\" He began to kiss you down your neck, and you felt your heart beat frantically as you leant into him. You didn't mean to encourage him, but every time he kissed you, strange warmth would seep into your skin, and you just needed to feel warm all over. \"I do wish to fly away,\" you whispered without thinking. He hummed against your throat as his hands rub soothing circles against your back. You bit your own lip this time, trying not to let the unladylike sounds escape your body. \"Do you my darling?\" he asks and begins to unbutton the front of your long heavy dress. \"Yes,\" you gasp when his fingers brush against your exposed skin. \"You can fly away with me, my love, come with me to the house of the Gods, and you and I can live together eternally.\" \"Yes,\" you gasp again, your eyes closing as his hands float over your breasts fleetingly before he nudges the sleeves of your dress off your shoulders. Cool air caresses your skin and your nipples harden from the cold. Dionysus takes advantage of your surprise and begins to knead pull at your breasts before latching onto one nipple, making you gasp and groan as he rolls it between his teeth. He stops for a moment and you blush when you whine out of disappointment. He only smirks before wrapping his arms around your bare back and leading you towards your bed in the corner of your room. \"You can come with me to Mount Olympus, my love,\" he says again as he lays you down, \"But it does not come without cost.\" The words sink in slowly, like a poison, as he continues his ministrations on your breast. You arch your back up to him, and the noises you make only encourage him further as he bites the flesh of a breast, leaving his mark. \"What cost?\" you asked breathily, and bit your lip again as his hands start to wander down south of your body. \"You can never see your family again,\" he begins, and starts to kiss you further and further down to your stomach, lavishing in the soft skin he finds there, \"You can never return to the realm of mortals, for you will be immortal.\" His hands now rest at your thighs, and he seemed to be massaging the tensed muscles there. His mouth ghost just above the curls at the apex of your legs and you shudder out gasping breaths as his hands massage down your legs and back up to your thighs. \"What else is there?\" you asked softly. You know that it is no mean feat to change what is mortal to immortal. \"For you to become immortal as I am, then you must endure a trial of my choosing. Though the God of Madness I may be, this trial shall not be easy,\" he said loud enough for you to hear over the blood rushing in your ears. \"I will drive you insane, my love. I will push the limits of your mind until your feel your very conscious thoughts expanding and bursting from your skull. You shall see the world as I see it, for a moment, and it shall drive you to madness.\" You believe that you are almost half mad already by the way he's touching you; by the way his tongue glides over your heated sex. \"How do I pass this trial?\" \"You must endure this madness, as I endure it always, my love, you need only to hold onto me, and think of me whenever you feel as though you might fail this task.\" His fingers enter you suddenly, and you wince at the intrusion, but you realise quickly that his mouth attached firmly to your clitoris is more than enough recompense. Your fingers thread through his golden curls and thrust up against his mouth as his fingers delve deeper inside you. You might have been concerned about this madness he spoke of, but he was ever so good at distraction that it almost completely left your mind. You feel as though you are on fire with the way his tongue laps and sucks at your sex, and your groan wantonly as you feel as you are approaching something. Your heart thuds loudly in your chest and your breath leaves your throat in short sharp shallow gasps for air. Is this the madness he had spoken about? Is that what he was leading you towards? You can't imagine anything bad coming from this; pleasure fills your body, and you squeeze your eyes tightly realising that you are heading towards the edge of a cliff. Whether this leads to madness or not, you could care less, it just felt so good, you couldn't stop yourself. \"Yes, my love,\" he purrs, lifting his head to watch you as you come undone. His roughly thumbs your clitoris and you cry out as it pushes you over the edge. You buck up against him, and you hear him chuckle as his hands grip your thighs, forcing you to be still as waves of pleasure wash over you. He kisses you languidly, spending a few moments on your neglected breasts as you come down from your high. \"Was that the madness you spoke of, Dionysus?\" you ask, and you hear him chuckle again. It would seem not. \"No, my beloved, you shall know when the real madness begins.\" He kisses you up along your neck again, and you smile as the familiar sensation of strange warmth seeps into your skin once more. \"You are so warm, Dionysus.\" \"That is because I am a God, my darling. Do you wish to feel more heat?\" he asks you and gazes into your eyes, a soft uncertain smile gracing his moist lips. You lean up to kiss his lips, surprising him and yourself, before he deepens the kiss. You allow his tongue to enter your mouth, and he explores it slowly, teasingly. Images of your apparent dream the night before flit before your eyes as you remember a similar muscle that had entered you as well. You whimper unintentionally as the same heat you felt before spreads across your stomach. You wish to feel all the warmth, and all the fire he could give to you. You were greedy, and you wanted his heat in the most carnal of ways. You are sure that his loin cloth disappeared just as he'd made it appear, for now he was as nude as you, and he was thrusting the length of his erection against your clitoris causing you to let loose the most sinful sounds from your lips. \"I think you are, indeed, ready for my heat, my love,\" he whispers, and pushes two fingers inside of you as if to prove this. They slide easily inside you, and he massages your inner walls making you moan again. You no longer care if you sound like some wanton whore; you just want him to continue what he was doing. There was a moment of complete silence, save for you heavy breathing and his, as he guided his member to you dripping entrance. He kisses you softly and you feel as though everything around you has suddenly frozen; you and he were both completely still. \"I am so sorry, my dearest,\" he whispers, and then with a sudden jerk he is fully sheathed inside you, and you cry out from the burn that the flows from where your bodies are joined. And suddenly you don't feel the pain any more. It comes quickly and suddenly and leaves, and an entirely different sensation fills your body. You try and open your eyes but all you see is blackness, and you worry that this is madness Dionysus had spoke of before. \"I cannot see,\" you whimper and grab a hold of his arms, as if to anchor yourself to this world. \"Fear not, my love,\" he bites out. His voice is tight and hoarse, and he does not move at all as you feel your own body adjust to the God's girth. \"Just don't - ah - don't move, my dear.\" When you hear his voice catch, you almost feel powerful. Rather, you would feel powerful if you did not feel so confused. Instead of blackness, colours began to drip into your line of sight. They were bright luminescent colours that seemed full of life. You gasped when you looked up at Dionysus and saw him for what he truly was. He shone a glorious golden colour, and his eyes were bluer than the sea. You could see the very breath that passed through his lips - so bright it was. He seemed the clean the very air around him, and when you looked down you saw how you began to glow as well. He leant down and kissed you again, and you felt the same strange warmth again. He began move, slowly, back and forth, creating a most wonderful friction. You could see how everywhere he touched you, his golden essence would sparkle like distant stars and soak into your own skin. The colours became brighter, almost blindingly so, and the fused together all at once and disappeared as though they were never there. It became chaotic, and you knew if you stared to long you would begin screaming from sheer terror. \"Do not look away, my beloved,\" he said quickly, and he quickened his pace inside you. You felt the familiar heat you had felt before, and you could more easily feel the cliff he was pushing you to. Reds and blues and golden hues begin to swirl in your vision, and for a moment you swore that you could see exactly what he saw. Your mouth slid open in surprise as you yourself, with your own golden light glowing from inside of you. Your hair looked like a halo around your head, and every inch of you was covered with a sheen of perspiration, making the golden colour seem to glitter about you. You looked every bit a goddess of Olympus, and the thought made you choke. Just as suddenly you could see him again, and you felt that red hot coil in your belly, that promise of waves of pleasure build up; Dionysus seemed unlikely to stop any time soon, and you began to feel the pain in your mind he had spoken of. It started at the base of your skull, and it spread around to your temples, and shot through your spine making you buck reflexively. Dionysus groaned on top of you as your gripped him tight with your inner walls, and he began kissing you all over you face again as he thrust into you, whispering husky apologies. The pleasure just kept building and building inside your body, and you wondered if it would ever stop. It was release you wanted; release from your weak and fragile mortal body; release from the dismal life you had lead; you wanted to be one of the immortals that sat atop Olympus and watched the human race waste away. Your head felt as though it was going to explode, and you seemed unable to fall from that edge you had before. The denial of your pleasure was driving you insane, as much as the confusing colours and the reverberating pain in your mind. \"Oh, my dearest love,\" you heard Dionysus grind out. You cried out as you felt yourself slipping away from him, and you began to see the bright, vibrant colours leave you. You lifted yourself up to wrap your arms around his neck, so afraid of losing him, and of losing your chance to fly away. \"Don't let me go,\" you whisper, as everything around you became a chaotic mess of colours and sounds and long deep kisses. \"Just hold onto me,\" he replied reassuringly, but did not slow his pace. The colours became brighter again, and they blind you, and you feel every sensation, whether it be pain or pleasure, to your very core. You hear Dionysus chant your name like a prayer. You don't know when you pass out, only that he roared your name as he released his seed into you, and you felt your soul explode. XXXX You awake in bed, far bigger and softer than your own. You feel Dionysus' arms wrapped around your body, and you are both nude, but underneath velvet soft blankets. You open your eyes and find yourself in a white marble room. \"Where am I?\" you ask and turn to look at your bed partner. \"You are in Olympus, my love,\" Dionysus says easily and brings a hand up to stroke your cheek. \"So, that is how you see the world, Dionysus?\" \"Yes, my dear.\" \"I see why they call you the God of Madness.\" He chuckles at her honesty, and kisses her slowly and lazily. \"And what a fine madness it is.\"",

      "\"How do I pass this trial?\"",
      "\"You must endure this madness, as I endure it always, my love, you need only to hold onto me, and think of me whenever you feel as though you might fail this task.\"",
      "His fingers enter you suddenly, and you wince at the intrusion, but you realise quickly that his mouth attached firmly to your clitoris is more than enough recompense.",
      "Your fingers thread through his golden curls and thrust up against his mouth as his fingers delve deeper inside you.",
      "You might have been concerned about this madness he spoke of, but he was ever so good at distraction that it almost completely left your mind.",
      "You feel as though you are on fire with the way his tongue laps and sucks at your sex, and your groan wantonly as you feel as you are approaching something.",
      "Your heart thuds loudly in your chest and your breath leaves your throat in short sharp shallow gasps for air.",
      "Is this the madness he had spoken about?",
      "Is that what he was leading you towards?",
      "You can't imagine anything bad coming from this; pleasure fills your body, and you squeeze your eyes tightly realising that you are heading towards the edge of a cliff.",
      "Whether this leads to madness or not, you could care less, it just felt so good, you couldn't stop yourself.",
      "\"Yes, my love,\" he purrs, lifting his head to watch you as you come undone.",
      "His roughly thumbs your clitoris and you cry out as it pushes you over the edge.",
      "You buck up against him, and you hear him chuckle as his hands grip your thighs, forcing you to be still as waves of pleasure wash over you.",
      "He kisses you languidly, spending a few moments on your neglected breasts as you come down from your high.",
      "\"Was that the madness you spoke of, Dionysus?\" you ask, and you hear him chuckle again.",
      "It would seem not.",
      "\"No, my beloved, you shall know when the real madness begins.\"",
      "He kisses you up along your neck again, and you smile as the familiar sensation of strange warmth seeps into your skin once more.",
      "\"You are so warm, Dionysus.\"",
      "\"That is because I am a God, my darling.",
      "Do you wish to feel more heat?\" he asks you and gazes into your eyes, a soft uncertain smile gracing his moist lips.",
      "You lean up to kiss his lips, surprising him and yourself, before he deepens the kiss.",
      "You allow his tongue to enter your mouth, and he explores it slowly, teasingly.",
      "Images of your apparent dream the night before flit before your eyes as you remember a similar muscle that had entered you as well.",
      "You whimper unintentionally as the same heat you felt before spreads across your stomach.",
      "You wish to feel all the warmth, and all the fire he could give to you.",
      "You were greedy, and you wanted his heat in the most carnal of ways.",
      "You are sure that his loin cloth disappeared just as he'd made it appear, for now he was as nude as you, and he was thrusting the length of his erection against your clitoris causing you to let loose the most sinful sounds from your lips.",
      "\"I think you are, indeed, ready for my heat, my love,\" he whispers, and pushes two fingers inside of you as if to prove this.",
      "They slide easily inside you, and he massages your inner walls making you moan again.",
      "You no longer care if you sound like some wanton whore; you just want him to continue what he was doing.",
      "There was a moment of complete silence, save for you heavy breathing and his, as he guided his member to you dripping entrance.",
      "He kisses you softly and you feel as though everything around you has suddenly frozen; you and he were both completely still.",
      "\"I am so sorry, my dearest,\" he whispers, and then with a sudden jerk he is fully sheathed inside you, and you cry out from the burn that the flows from where your bodies are joined.",
      "And suddenly you don't feel the pain any more.",
      "It comes quickly and suddenly and leaves, and an entirely different sensation fills your body.",
      "You try and open your eyes but all you see is blackness, and you worry that this is madness Dionysus had spoke of before.",
      "\"I cannot see,\" you whimper and grab a hold of his arms, as if to anchor yourself to this world.",
      "\"Fear not, my love,\" he bites out.",
      "His voice is tight and hoarse, and he does not move at all as you feel your own body adjust to the God's girth.",
      "\"Just don't - ah - don't move, my dear.\"",
      "When you hear his voice catch, you almost feel powerful.",
      "Rather, you would feel powerful if you did not feel so confused.",
      "Instead of blackness, colours began to drip into your line of sight.",
      "They were bright luminescent colours that seemed full of life.",
      "You gasped when you looked up at Dionysus and saw him for what he truly was.",
      "He shone a glorious golden colour, and his eyes were bluer than the sea.",
      "You could see the very breath that passed through his lips - so bright it was.",
      "He seemed the clean the very air around him, and when you looked down you saw how you began to glow as well.",
      "He leant down and kissed you again, and you felt the same strange warmth again.",
      "He began move, slowly, back and forth, creating a most wonderful friction.",
      "You could see how everywhere he touched you, his golden essence would sparkle like distant stars and soak into your own skin.",
      "The colours became brighter, almost blindingly so, and the fused together all at once and disappeared as though they were never there.",
      "It became chaotic, and you knew if you stared to long you would begin screaming from sheer terror.",
      "\"Do not look away, my beloved,\" he said quickly, and he quickened his pace inside you.",
      "You felt the familiar heat you had felt before, and you could more easily feel the cliff he was pushing you to.",
      "Reds and blues and golden hues begin to swirl in your vision, and for a moment you swore that you could see exactly what he saw.",
      "Your mouth slid open in surprise as you yourself, with your own golden light glowing from inside of you.",
      "Your hair looked like a halo around your head, and every inch of you was covered with a sheen of perspiration, making the golden colour seem to glitter about you.",
      "You looked every bit a goddess of Olympus, and the thought made you choke.",
      "Just as suddenly you could see him again, and you felt that red hot coil in your belly, that promise of waves of pleasure build up; Dionysus seemed unlikely to stop any time soon, and you began to feel the pain in your mind he had spoken of.",
      "It started at the base of your skull, and it spread around to your temples, and shot through your spine making you buck reflexively.",
      "Dionysus groaned on top of you as your gripped him tight with your inner walls, and he began kissing you all over you face again as he thrust into you, whispering husky apologies.",
      "The pleasure just kept building and building inside your body, and you wondered if it would ever stop.",
      "It was release you wanted; release from your weak and fragile mortal body; release from the dismal life you had lead; you wanted to be one of the immortals that sat atop Olympus and watched the human race waste away.",
      "Your head felt as though it was going to explode, and you seemed unable to fall from that edge you had before.",
      "The denial of your pleasure was driving you insane, as much as the confusing colours and the reverberating pain in your mind.",
      "\"Oh, my dearest love,\" you heard Dionysus grind out.",
      "You cried out as you felt yourself slipping away from him, and you began to see the bright, vibrant colours leave you.",
      "You lifted yourself up to wrap your arms around his neck, so afraid of losing him, and of losing your chance to fly away.",
      "\"Don't let me go,\" you whisper, as everything around you became a chaotic mess of colours and sounds and long deep kisses.",
      "\"Just hold onto me,\" he replied reassuringly, but did not slow his pace.",
      "The colours became brighter again, and they blind you, and you feel every sensation, whether it be pain or pleasure, to your very core.",
      "You hear Dionysus chant your name like a prayer.",
      "You don't know when you pass out, only that he roared your name as he released his seed into you, and you felt your soul explode.",
      "XXXX You awake in bed, far bigger and softer than your own.",
      "You feel Dionysus' arms wrapped around your body, and you are both nude, but underneath velvet soft blankets.",
      "You open your eyes and find yourself in a white marble room.",
      "\"Where am I?\" you ask and turn to look at your bed partner.",
      "\"You are in Olympus, my love,\" Dionysus says easily and brings a hand up to stroke your cheek.",
      "\"So, that is how you see the world, Dionysus?\"",
      "\"Yes, my dear.\"",
      "\"I see why they call you the God of Madness.\"",
      "He chuckles at her honesty, and kisses her slowly and lazily.",
      "\"And what a fine madness it is.\""

    "text": "Demeter thinks that Persephone should be grateful to be brought out of that dark prison of the earth where Hades dragged her. Demeter thinks that Persephone should be glad to become Kore again, to scatter flowers in her wake and dance in her mother's footsteps and be innocent again. Persephone is not grateful. The dark Underworld is not a prison to her; the vast dim plains of the dead hold no horror for her. She is not glad to be Kore again, to watch the flowers bloom at her footsteps, to become again her mother's shadow - she who is Queen of the Dead! She who rules dark Hades himself! She who is more beautiful than Aphrodite, more powerful than Hera, before whose shrines the flowers never die - she should be glad to be a handmaiden again? No, she is not grateful. But there are rules, even for goddesses, and so Persephone puts on her old name again, dances her old steps again, fawns upon her mother as her mother so desires, and speaks no word of complaint. But she waits, eager as a hound upon a leash, until the Equinox - until she can escape. Then, oh, then! Then she goes dancing down the long road to her husband's halls, leaving Kore and flowers and sunlight behind, and rejoices as she passes into darkness. For there at the end of the road is Hades on his pale throne, tall and menacing as he has ever been and ever will be, and he is all Persephone has ever wanted. He chose her, those long years ago, and she chose him, and each year she chooses him again. Each year she kneels before him on his pale throne, and each year he stands and lifts her to her feet and seats her on the throne, and calls his subjects to acclaim their queen. Each year he sits contented at her feet as she greets old friends and learns what has passed in the dark realm in the months gone by. Each year she stands, audiences at last at an end, and leads him through long hallways to their bedchamber. She knows he does not sleep here when she is gone. No; he sleeps in a little chamber near the throne-room, with a bed barely long enough for his frame, for when she is not here he buries himself in his duties and does not wish to sleep. And so this first night home she welcomes him again into their bed with warm kisses and warmer embraces, with murmured words of love so long put aside and now revived. He is not a man of many words, her husband, but she does not need words to know how he has missed her - not when he touches her like she is fragile and precious, kisses her like he needs her more than air. She knows he loves her, and she knows, too, as she twines herself around him like a vine about a tree, clinging to him for dear life, or so it seems, that he knows that she loves him, too. Kore is a virgin, and so it is that every year Persephone offers up her maidenhead to her husband, and every year he takes great care that she shall have no pain in the losing of it; and he is skilled indeed with his long pale fingers and his clever, wordless tongue. Persephone looks forward to this night all through the long sunlit months: to his hands upon her breasts and sides and thighs, to his teeth so gentle and so dangerous upon her throat, to his manhood proud and glorious in her hands, and the hissing breaths between his teeth as she strokes him. And more than all of these, Persephone looks forward to the moment when he comes to rest within her, still as death for long moments save that he cannot stop kissing her, long biting kisses that say Welcome, and I missed you, and I love you so. And then the moment ends and he is moving again, thrusting into her in long sleek movements which make her arch and cry out and rake her nails along his back, and this is what she should be grateful to escape? When they are spent and sated, Persephone curls within her husband's arms and smiles into the darkness, and Hades holds her close and falls into peaceful sleep; and now, at last, Persephone is grateful to be home.",

She shakes off her sunlight name, leaves Kore trailing in the dust like a cast-off snakeskin, and beneath her feet lilies and anemones bloom in the soft earth, and still he waits. It is always her choice. Always, she chooses to cross the great river, to stroke the huge heads of Cerberus who adores her, to stride through the gates and up the wide marble steps to where her husband sits, still as stone and cold as bone. He rises only when she reaches him, when she holds out a slender hand and smiles; and then, and only then, does he rise and clasp her to him. She goes willingly - that is the key to it. Willingly into his arms; willingly into his bed. Willingly, she undresses, and willingly draws him down with her in a tangle of pale limbs and kisses. He is a considerate lover, which might surprise those who judge him by the examples of his brothers; but he is neither Zeus nor Poseidon: he has no liking for unwilling women, nor for boys snatched all unwary from their homes, and indeed no eyes for any woman but Persephone. She is beautiful, laid out upon their bed, as pale and delicate-seeming as one of the lilies which follows her footsteps, as elegant and as glorious. He loves her whole-heartedly, and it is the joy and comfort of his years that she returns his love. He is careful, therefore, to lavish love upon her in any way he can, and this is one: to touch her, gently and sweetly, in all the places which best please her; to kiss her, hard and joyous, on lips and breasts and wide-spread thighs, and up between them until she cries out in sudden pleasure; to rise above her, pale as his marble throne, and sink into her - And though this is his kingdom, his palace, his bed, it is only at these moments, as his wife shakes in pleasure beneath him and cries out his name, that Hades truly feels he is home.",

    "text": "She lives alone and that's how she likes it. The river borders her land on two sides; little better than a creek, but it's a line and no one crosses it. The road makes up the third boundary, far enough away that most days she doesn't so much as hear a car. She has three old hounds and a neighbor woman that sells off some of her produce to her so she never has to go into town. It's like a kingdom of her own. It's enough. At the height of summer, the boy comes tripping into her property. She doesn't see him at first, just hears the dogs baying through the open kitchen window. It's not their joyful, hunting cry; it sounds like rage, so she puts on her hat and picks up her rifle. The dry ground cracks under her boots as she follows the sound. She slips through the last stand of trees and sees the boy standing on a rock on the near bank of the river. The hounds have surrounded him, jaws snapping near his bare feet. He flinches, arms flailing, ready to fall. \"Dog!\" she hollers, and three heads turn. One by one they trot over to her, standing clustered around her legs with tongues lolling. \"You named all of them 'Dog'?\" the boy stammers. \"I didn't name them anything.\" The boy steps gingerly down from the rock and she takes her first proper look at him. His hair is bleached blond by the sun; his skin a rich tan that's undercut by paler flashes from beneath his shirt cuffs. He has a man's length of bone, a man's jaw, but there's still a little puppy fat clinging to his cheeks. Pleasing enough, if you're looking to be pleased. \"Miss...It's Miss Hedda, right?\" the boy asks. She nods. \"You're Dee's boy, I suppose.\" Her neighbor has mentioned having a son, bits of conversation dropped off with the preserves and the last tomatoes of the season. \"Yes, ma'am. Percy, ma'am.\" \"I was under the impression you were still a child.\" Dee has never called him anything but 'my baby' or 'my little boy.' Hedda had pictured a toddler at best. Percy's mouth twists into something that is trying to be a smile. \"Aren't we all still children in our parent's eyes?\" he muses, trying for witty and coming out much too honest. \"I wouldn't know,\" she replies. \"My brother emptied both barrels of a shotgun into my daddy when I was small, and my mamma wasn't much help even before that.\" The boy's jaw drops and Hedda remembers why she never attempts small talk. \"I don't get many visitors,\" she adds, as if that needed mentioning. \"You want something to eat?\" \"No, ma'am,\" the boy stammers, \"but I'd be grateful for a cool drink.\" She leads him back to the house and pours him a tall glass of lemonade. He drinks it in silence, sitting at her kitchen table, grass green eyes flicking over to where she's leaning against the counter with a glass of her own. When he's finished, he thanks her and leaves. The dogs don't even lift their heads to watch him walk out the door. Hedda figures she'll never see him again. When the boy shows up again the following week, Hedda reasons it's hardly the first time she's been wrong. The dogs see nothing to report, given that Hedda allowed him in before, so they don't make a sound until he's already on the front porch. She answers the door in a faded sundress, her long dark hair falling out of its bun. Percy offers a shy smile. \"I thought I might get another glass of that lemonade?\" he says. \"If it's not too much trouble.\" \"No,\" Hedda blurts, then shakes herself before his expression can finish falling. \"It's not. Too much trouble, I mean.\" This time, she sits at the table with him. The boy makes idle conversation about the weather and Hedda manages to reply; it's less awkward than before, but still confusing. When Hedda stands up to fetch the pitcher, she turns back halfway to the counter. \"What are you doing here?\" she asks. \"And if you say one word about lemonade, boy, I'm getting my gun.\" Percy flushes, red crawling up his neck beneath his tan. \"I...My mamma thinks I'm a child and treats me like one. It's like she's afraid to let me out into the world. My only friends are my cousins and I'm lucky to see them once a year. I don't really know anybody I'm not kin to and I thought...\" He scrubs a hand through his hair. \"Ma'am, I'm just really tired of being alone. It's not a feeling I want to get used to and I'm afraid that I could.\" Hedda is quiet for a long moment. \"Yeah,\" she says at last, voice hoarse. \"I understand that.\" The boy's visits become more frequent as the summer draws to a close. Sometimes he arrives with dirt still under his nails from working on the farm. Hedda doesn't ask what he tells his mother about where he goes. She doesn't particularly want to know. Hedda makes batch after batch of lemonade and loans him books; most of her collection is so worn, the titles have faded from the spines. She has to pick them out for him. They talk long into the evenings about the books, about all the places he wants to go when he finally breaks away from the farm. \"I don't know that I could leave,\" Hedda confesses one night. \"This is my land. I...\" Her heart pounds at the thought. She reaches for her glass, a tremor running through her fingers. Percy catches her hand in his. \"I'll go,\" he says gently. \"And then when I get back, I'll tell you all about it.\" Hedda laughs, gives his hand a squeeze. \"Alright, then.\" In the fall, she goes hunting. She's still out when Percy comes for his visit, so he wanders further into her property to find her. By the time he reaches her, she's nearly finished field dressing a deer. Percy takes one look at the carcass and promptly turns a little green. Hedda sighs and gestures with her knife to a clean patch of grass. \"Sit down before you fall down,\" she says. \"Put your head between your knees.\" Percy does as instructed; by the time he gets his breath back, Hedda is cleaning her knives. \"What are you gonna do with all that?\" he asks, standing back up. \"Most of this I'll freeze, a little I'll cook today, but some is at its best fresh.\" Her knife glides through the deer's heart, carving it into thin slices like fruit. \"Here,\" she says, holding out a piece. He bends down and eats it right out of her hand. She feels his lips brush her fingers and shivers. He chews, swallows hard. She watches his throat work and thinks about running her fingers down it. \"It's good,\" he murmurs. \"Help me get this home,\" she says. When the deer is safely strung up in her shed and her knives put away, Hedda turns to thank him and falls silent. There's blood left on his mouth from the deer heart, a flash of color on his still pale face. \"What?\" he asks. Hedda lays her hands on his shoulders, drags one thumb in a heavy line along his collarbone. His eyes are wide, his breath short like that first day in summer, as if her hounds were at his heels again. She bends down slowly. He doesn't pull away when she kisses him, just parts his lips, maybe in shock, but Hedda presses the advantage. She coaxes his mouth further open, lets her tongue flicker inside when she hears him moan. The boy tastes like spring. Taking him into her bed shouldn't be this easy. She should feel guilty or at least conflicted, but she feels only elated. He's a man in the eyes of the law and he wants to be here; that's good enough for her. They keep kissing all the way into her house and up the stairs, shedding clothes behind them like leaves. When she has him naked before her, she puts her mouth on all the places where his farmer's tan bleeds into fishbelly white; lips and teeth tracing the boundary. She feels him twitch under her palms, hears his breath stop, pushes him down onto the mattress. They curl together on their sides; she lets his hands wander, lets someone else really touch her for the first time in years and years. She pulls him over on top of her, one leg curling high around his hip. Percy moans. She reaches down to guide him into her, feels his cock twitch in her grasp and knows he won't last long. She doesn't care. They have plenty of time. His arms tremble beside her face as he pushes inside. She turns her head, mouths at the tendons of his wrist as he settles. At the first roll of his hips, he collapses over her, shivering again. \"I can't,\" he half-snarls into the curve of her neck. \"I'm gonna--\" \"Then do it, darling,\" she purrs against his ear. \"I want to see.\" A blush creeps over his neck and she wants to worry that skin with her teeth, but then she won't be able to see his face. He thrusts twice more and then orgasm hits him like a knife to the back; she watches the shock and relief sweep over his face. She locks her ankles in the small of his back as he keeps trying to move inside her. She pushes the hair back from his face, kisses his forehead and cheek and mouth and his mouth and his mouth. She frowns at the ache when he slides out, but laughs, back arching, when he keeps crawling down her body, pushing her legs further apart with his shoulders. Outside the window, the first snow comes early. The boy knows nothing of women, is insatiable in his curiosity. Hedda feels blessed to have such an eager student. He loves the taste of her, will eat her out for an hour at a time, but can never last when she gets her mouth on him. He likes her above him, her hands pressing down on his shoulders while his own dig bruises into her waist. They'll kiss goodbye for half an hour at the door before slowly pulling apart; Percy trudging off into the chill night, Hedda watching him go. She wanders her property while he's gone, singing to herself, gathering pomegranates from gnarled trees before the frost takes them. They were the only thing she could ever get to grow here. One night, Percy walks home still eating one and that's how the trouble starts. Dee never exactly makes her displeasure known. She just stops making her deliveries. Hedda has enough canned goods to last, if she's careful, and more than enough meat. If she were a different person, she'd march over to Dee's house and tell her that her son is a man grown who can spend his time how he likes. She'd tell her that she loves him. But she's not that person, so she piles more quilts on the bed, builds up the fire. She is prepared for a long cold winter when the knock comes at her door. Percy is standing there with snow caked up to his knees, clutching a duffle bag. \"Would you mind some company, ma'am?\" She grabs him by the lapels of his coat and hauls him inside. As spring gets closer, their fucking turns desperate. They end up on the floor as often as anything, banging scrapes and bruises into each other like lovers' tokens. \"I won't go home,\" Percy gasps. \"Yes, you will. I'm not a goddamn thief, stealing people's children.\" Hedda winds her hand tight in his hair, bends his head back until she can sink her teeth into his throat. Percy cries out and she feels his hips twist. \"Don't you come yet,\" she hisses against his skin. \"Don't you fucking dare.\" \"Yes, ma'am,\" he breathes. The words slide liquid hot down her spine. She grinds down onto him, teeth bared. He slips a hand between them, fingers so much more delicate against her than she wants, and she comes with a sob. He strokes his hands up and down her spine, soothing, slows the roll of his hips until she thinks he'll never get off. He does, though, with a full-body shudder, his arms tightening around her until it hurts. It takes Hedda a long time to realize she's crying. Percy leaves for home the next morning. Warm days come and Percy does not. Neither does Dee. Hedda chews on the last of winter's deer jerky and considers her options. It takes her three days to work up the nerve. She puts on the best dress she has left and polishes her boots. She picks out her hat with the broadest brim and sets off toward town. To her surprise, they still remember her there, or at least her family name. Apparently her brother has done quite well for himself; looks like he's a shoo-in for governor. Hedda decides not to mention the shotgun. Instead, she says only that she lost touch with Zebulon some years back, but she's pleased to hear how well he is. Do send her love if he should come around; in the meantime, might she get some help with her shopping? The grocer drives her back out to her house in his truck; the back is full of her purchases, mostly food but with a few bags of new clothes and some kibble for the dogs. He helps her unload everything onto the porch; she dismisses his offer to help take things inside with a smile and the honest admission that she doesn't know where it's all going. In the end, organizing everything occupies the rest of the day and into the night. She falls into bed pleasantly worn out and sleeps without dreaming. Hedda takes trips into town once a month to stock up on necessities. She has no interest in making friends, but she can be friendly and the people are friendly in return. She wonders if Dee has told them about how she spent last winter; if they do know, no one seems inclined to judge. They're hardly hiding their sons everytime she walks into a room, and that's good enough for Hedda. The smell of Percy on her pillows and sheets fades to nothing. Hedda is drinking her coffee, looking out the window at the frost on the trees, when the hounds take up a cry. They charge off toward the river, baying. Hedda drops her mug, leaving shattered porcelain on the kitchen floor as she runs after them. She's ten steps out the door before she realizes she isn't wearing shoes, five more steps before she realizes she won't turn back to get them. She charges through trees, out of breath and limping. Percy is standing on the bank of the river, his duffle at his feet, the hounds swarming around him with wide doggy grins. \"My momma's gone south for the winter,\" he says, the corner of his mouth tugging up in a smile. Hedda flips the tangle of her hair out of her face. \"And she let you stay behind?\" \"No, ma'am. I just told her I wasn't going.\" Percy's smile widens. \"That is, if you'll have me?\" \"You fool boy,\" she says. \"I will always have you.\" Percy laughs. She pushes her way through the hounds and shoves him down on the riverbank. He keeps laughing, right up until she settles astride his hips, and then he goes very, very still. Hedda digs her fingers into the cold earth beside his head. \"I will always have you,\" she whispers into his mouth. He whispers back, \"Yes, ma'am.\"",

      "She has to pick them out for him.",
      "They talk long into the evenings about the books, about all the places he wants to go when he finally breaks away from the farm.",
      "\"I don't know that I could leave,\" Hedda confesses one night.",
      "\"This is my land.",
      "I...\" Her heart pounds at the thought.",
      "She reaches for her glass, a tremor running through her fingers.",
      "Percy catches her hand in his.",
      "\"I'll go,\" he says gently.",
      "\"And then when I get back, I'll tell you all about it.\"",
      "Hedda laughs, gives his hand a squeeze.",
      "\"Alright, then.\"",
      "In the fall, she goes hunting.",
      "She's still out when Percy comes for his visit, so he wanders further into her property to find her.",
      "By the time he reaches her, she's nearly finished field dressing a deer.",
      "Percy takes one look at the carcass and promptly turns a little green.",
      "Hedda sighs and gestures with her knife to a clean patch of grass.",
      "\"Sit down before you fall down,\" she says.",
      "\"Put your head between your knees.\"",
      "Percy does as instructed; by the time he gets his breath back, Hedda is cleaning her knives.",
      "\"What are you gonna do with all that?\" he asks, standing back up.",
      "\"Most of this I'll freeze, a little I'll cook today, but some is at its best fresh.\"",
      "Her knife glides through the deer's heart, carving it into thin slices like fruit.",
      "\"Here,\" she says, holding out a piece.",
      "He bends down and eats it right out of her hand.",
      "She feels his lips brush her fingers and shivers.",
      "He chews, swallows hard.",
      "She watches his throat work and thinks about running her fingers down it.",
      "\"It's good,\" he murmurs.",
      "\"Help me get this home,\" she says.",
      "When the deer is safely strung up in her shed and her knives put away, Hedda turns to thank him and falls silent.",
      "There's blood left on his mouth from the deer heart, a flash of color on his still pale face.",
      "\"What?\" he asks.",
      "Hedda lays her hands on his shoulders, drags one thumb in a heavy line along his collarbone.",
      "His eyes are wide, his breath short like that first day in summer, as if her hounds were at his heels again.",
      "She bends down slowly.",
      "He doesn't pull away when she kisses him, just parts his lips, maybe in shock, but Hedda presses the advantage.",
      "She coaxes his mouth further open, lets her tongue flicker inside when she hears him moan.",
      "The boy tastes like spring.",
      "Taking him into her bed shouldn't be this easy.",
      "She should feel guilty or at least conflicted, but she feels only elated.",
      "He's a man in the eyes of the law and he wants to be here; that's good enough for her.",
      "They keep kissing all the way into her house and up the stairs, shedding clothes behind them like leaves.",
      "When she has him naked before her, she puts her mouth on all the places where his farmer's tan bleeds into fishbelly white; lips and teeth tracing the boundary.",
      "She feels him twitch under her palms, hears his breath stop, pushes him down onto the mattress.",
      "They curl together on their sides; she lets his hands wander, lets someone else really touch her for the first time in years and years.",
      "She pulls him over on top of her, one leg curling high around his hip.",
      "Percy moans.",
      "She reaches down to guide him into her, feels his cock twitch in her grasp and knows he won't last long.",
      "She doesn't care.",
      "They have plenty of time.",
      "His arms tremble beside her face as he pushes inside.",
      "She turns her head, mouths at the tendons of his wrist as he settles.",
      "At the first roll of his hips, he collapses over her, shivering again.",
      "\"I can't,\" he half-snarls into the curve of her neck.",
      "\"I'm gonna--\" \"Then do it, darling,\" she purrs against his ear.",
      "\"I want to see.\"",
      "A blush creeps over his neck and she wants to worry that skin with her teeth, but then she won't be able to see his face.",
      "He thrusts twice more and then orgasm hits him like a knife to the back; she watches the shock and relief sweep over his face.",
      "She locks her ankles in the small of his back as he keeps trying to move inside her.",
      "She pushes the hair back from his face, kisses his forehead and cheek and mouth and his mouth and his mouth.",
      "She frowns at the ache when he slides out, but laughs, back arching, when he keeps crawling down her body, pushing her legs further apart with his shoulders.",
      "Outside the window, the first snow comes early.",
      "The boy knows nothing of women, is insatiable in his curiosity.",
      "Hedda feels blessed to have such an eager student.",
      "He loves the taste of her, will eat her out for an hour at a time, but can never last when she gets her mouth on him.",
      "He likes her above him, her hands pressing down on his shoulders while his own dig bruises into her waist.",
      "They'll kiss goodbye for half an hour at the door before slowly pulling apart; Percy trudging off into the chill night, Hedda watching him go.",
      "She wanders her property while he's gone, singing to herself, gathering pomegranates from gnarled trees before the frost takes them.",
      "They were the only thing she could ever get to grow here.",
      "One night, Percy walks home still eating one and that's how the trouble starts.",
      "Dee never exactly makes her displeasure known.",
      "She just stops making her deliveries.",
      "Hedda has enough canned goods to last, if she's careful, and more than enough meat.",
      "If she were a different person, she'd march over to Dee's house and tell her that her son is a man grown who can spend his time how he likes.",
      "She'd tell her that she loves him.",
      "But she's not that person, so she piles more quilts on the bed, builds up the fire.",
      "She is prepared for a long cold winter when the knock comes at her door.",
      "Percy is standing there with snow caked up to his knees, clutching a duffle bag.",
      "\"Would you mind some company, ma'am?\"",
      "She grabs him by the lapels of his coat and hauls him inside.",
      "As spring gets closer, their fucking turns desperate.",
      "They end up on the floor as often as anything, banging scrapes and bruises into each other like lovers' tokens.",
      "\"I won't go home,\" Percy gasps.",
      "\"Yes, you will.",
      "I'm not a goddamn thief, stealing people's children.\"",
      "Hedda winds her hand tight in his hair, bends his head back until she can sink her teeth into his throat.",
      "Percy cries out and she feels his hips twist.",
      "\"Don't you come yet,\" she hisses against his skin.",
      "\"Don't you fucking dare.\"",
      "\"Yes, ma'am,\" he breathes.",
      "The words slide liquid hot down her spine.",
      "She grinds down onto him, teeth bared.",
      "He slips a hand between them, fingers so much more delicate against her than she wants, and she comes with a sob.",
      "He strokes his hands up and down her spine, soothing, slows the roll of his hips until she thinks he'll never get off.",
      "He does, though, with a full-body shudder, his arms tightening around her until it hurts.",
      "It takes Hedda a long time to realize she's crying.",
      "Percy leaves for home the next morning.",
      "Warm days come and Percy does not.",
      "Neither does Dee.",
      "Hedda chews on the last of winter's deer jerky and considers her options.",
      "It takes her three days to work up the nerve.",
      "She puts on the best dress she has left and polishes her boots.",
      "She picks out her hat with the broadest brim and sets off toward town.",
      "To her surprise, they still remember her there, or at least her family name.",
      "Apparently her brother has done quite well for himself; looks like he's a shoo-in for governor.",
      "Hedda decides not to mention the shotgun.",
      "Instead, she says only that she lost touch with Zebulon some years back, but she's pleased to hear how well he is.",
      "Do send her love if he should come around; in the meantime, might she get some help with her shopping?",
      "The grocer drives her back out to her house in his truck; the back is full of her purchases, mostly food but with a few bags of new clothes and some kibble for the dogs.",
      "He helps her unload everything onto the porch; she dismisses his offer to help take things inside with a smile and the honest admission that she doesn't know where it's all going.",
      "In the end, organizing everything occupies the rest of the day and into the night.",
      "She falls into bed pleasantly worn out and sleeps without dreaming.",
      "Hedda takes trips into town once a month to stock up on necessities.",
      "She has no interest in making friends, but she can be friendly and the people are friendly in return.",
      "She wonders if Dee has told them about how she spent last winter; if they do know, no one seems inclined to judge.",
      "They're hardly hiding their sons everytime she walks into a room, and that's good enough for Hedda.",
      "The smell of Percy on her pillows and sheets fades to nothing.",
      "Hedda is drinking her coffee, looking out the window at the frost on the trees, when the hounds take up a cry.",
      "They charge off toward the river, baying.",
      "Hedda drops her mug, leaving shattered porcelain on the kitchen floor as she runs after them.",
      "She's ten steps out the door before she realizes she isn't wearing shoes, five more steps before she realizes she won't turn back to get them.",
      "She charges through trees, out of breath and limping.",
      "Percy is standing on the bank of the river, his duffle at his feet, the hounds swarming around him with wide doggy grins.",
      "\"My momma's gone south for the winter,\" he says, the corner of his mouth tugging up in a smile.",
      "Hedda flips the tangle of her hair out of her face.",
      "\"And she let you stay behind?\"",
      "\"No, ma'am.",
      "I just told her I wasn't going.\"",
      "Percy's smile widens.",
      "\"That is, if you'll have me?\"",
      "\"You fool boy,\" she says.",
      "\"I will always have you.\"",
      "Percy laughs.",
      "She pushes her way through the hounds and shoves him down on the riverbank.",
      "He keeps laughing, right up until she settles astride his hips, and then he goes very, very still.",
      "Hedda digs her fingers into the cold earth beside his head.",
      "\"I will always have you,\" she whispers into his mouth.",
      "He whispers back, \"Yes, ma'am.\""

    "text": "Brauron belongs to the Arktoi and Artemis does what she must to keep it that way. The bars are hers and the strip joints are hers and the sheriff is in her pocket. Every other club that wants to run product up or down the coast has to pass through her town and they pay for the privilege. If they think that the only all-female motorcycle club for seven states is going to be a pushover, they are quickly proved wrong. The desert has a wide embrace to welcome the dead. There is a woman in Artemis' bed and she does what she must to keep her there. Kallisto is bright and golden; she smells of gasoline and warm asphalt and everything Artemis loves. Artemis leaves epic poems of her devotion with her teeth on Kallisto's thighs, presses her desire inside on the tip of her tongue. Kallisto sobs and begs, hips rolling, but Artemis doesn't let go. Her love is greedy; Kallisto knew that before she ever kissed her, quick and chaste behind the garage in the fall when the weather was turning. Now it is summer and the sweat stands out on her lover's skin. Artemis laps it from the hollow of her throat, fingers slick and curling. Her life is everything she wanted when she left her father's house. She's afraid it won't last. The trouble starts small. Her father's Olympians are scaring patrons out of Arktoi bars, harassing the staff, driving club profits down. It's petty, no less than she expected from her father but so much milder than she dreamed. It still needs to be dealt with. She still doesn't want to. \"I'll go for you,\" Kallisto says one morning over breakfast. Artemis' head jerks up. \"You're sure?\" \"Of course. If he's half the asshole you've said he is, you don't need to be anywhere near him.\" Kallisto dishes scrambled eggs onto their plates. \"I'm your second; I can speak for you. I'll get it sorted out and be back by dinner.\" She isn't back by dinner. Artemis finds her in the kitchen the next morning, clutching a cup of coffee, eyes bloodshot. Before Artemis can ask what happened, Kallisto walks out. They play a game of avoidance for weeks. Kallisto shows up to club meetings and her shifts at the garage, but she won't sleep in Artemis' bed, won't even meet her eyes. Artemis corners her eventually in the hall bathroom, hunched over the toilet. Kallisto is only dry heaving, nerves and not illness; the source is obvious--a pregnancy test lies forgotten in the sink. Artemis doesn't bother to count the blue lines; her sinking feeling drops all the way through the floor. \"Who was it?\" (She knows already and hates that she knows.) \"Who?\" she howls and Kallisto flinches. Kallisto drags the back of her hand over her mouth, scrubbing away bile. \"It was your father.\" Kallisto tells her what happened in fits and starts. Artemis sits beside her on the bathroom floor, close but not touching, and listens. It's a familiar story. (Artemis remembers Leda, one of the Olympians' women. She got along with everybody, always had a smile and a kind word. Once, after a patching over, she'd been making eyes at a new guy all night. It had been enough to set off Zeus's temper. She remembers watching Zeus throw Leda down on a pool table and fuck her right there in front of everyone; the wings of her swan tattoo flexing along her shoulder blades as she tried to crawl away. Artemis had been twelve.) Eventually, carefully, they move back into Artemis' room. She spoons up behind Kallisto on the bed, slides one hand around to rest on her stomach. This could be her child. The only child she may ever have. \"It's gonna be alright,\" Artemis says. \"We'll make it alright.\" \"Yes,\" Kallisto breathes back. \"We will.\" Artemis is wrist-deep in an engine rebuild when her phone rings. She wipes her hands off, digs her phone out from her pocket. \"What.\" \"Art.\" It's her brother. He's the only one who ever got away with calling her that. (He stayed behind and most days she doesn't blame him. It's not like Daddy was trying to watch him in the shower.) \"Your girl's been here for the last two hours. She's in Dad's office; sounds like they're just talking, but--\" \"Yeah.\" Sometimes talking is dangerous enough. \"Thanks, Apollo. I appreciate it.\" \"Of course, sweetheart. Stay safe, okay?\" She hangs up so she won't have to lie to him. The following night, Artemis and Kallisto go for a ride. (It's something they did more often when the club was young: take just one bike and a blanket and drive out into the desert well past dark. They'd watch the stars and make out like teenagers until it got too cold to stand.) Kallisto wanders in a slow circle after they park, talking about her doctor's appointment and the girls she met in the waiting room. Artemis drops the kickstand, draws her gun from the saddlebag. \"Get on your knees, honey.\" Kallisto glances back, a smile already starting to form. She thinks Artemis is flirting right up until she spots the gun. The blood drains from her face. \"Artemis, please--\" \"Turn the fuck around and get down on your knees.\" She does, slowly, shakily, hands raised. \"Baby, you've got to understand--\" Artemis doesn't want to hear it. \"I understand perfectly. You sold me out.\" \"No, no, that's not true.\" Kallisto risks a peek over her shoulder; her pupils are blown in fear. \"I...I made a deal, yeah, but it's the best thing for all of us. It's going to keep us safe. We just...we just have to get patched over, and then he'll leave us alone.\" \"He'll leave us alone,\" Artemis repeats. \"I should give up my club--my club--because you think he'll keep his word?\" \"You'll lose the club anyway!\" Kallisto screams. The silence after is ringing, lasts for a solid minute before Kallisto adds, \"He's so angry, baby. We have to take his terms. Do you know what he wants to do to us? Do you know what he wants to do to you?\" \"Of course I fucking know!\" (She's known for years, known since he looked up and smiled, one hand pressing bruises into the back of Leda's neck. He did everything but touch her and she thought she was safe. Whatever she does now, it will be war: with her father first, and then whatever's left of the Olympians after. She doesn't care. She wants a war, wants bloodshed and ruin, wants the world to suffer for almost being everything she hoped for. But this could be her child. The only child she may ever have.) \"I did it for you,\" Kallisto is sobbing. \"I did it for us.\" \"I know, baby.\" Artemis pulls the trigger.",

    "text": "Snow crunching beneath his boots, the Lord of the Dead wandered through one of the Underworld's many regions. Truly, the imagination of mortals is astounding, Hades mused. Each time a new Land of the Dead became known to many people, a new, correlating area appeared in the Underworld. At this time, he was traveling through a Place of Punishment: cold, bleak, monotonous, and so very lonely. A flash of colour caught his eyes, and he advanced towards the oddity. When he reached it, his breath hitched in his throat. There on the ground, dressed in filmy summer garments, lay the most stunning young woman he had ever seen in his long life. With skin pale as cream and hair a pooling mass of auburn, the beauty formed an ideal of harmony. White blossoms both twined through her flowing locks and littered the frozen ground around her. Wandering downwards, his gaze stalled on full breasts, which... rose and fell with each breath. The child is alive?! the world-weary god thought in startlement. Immediately, he read the girl's aura; she was a goddess. Kneeling on the ground, he bent over her and extended a worshipful hand. Right before he touched her, she moaned and her lashes fluttered open. \"Mama?\" The young, so very young, woman's eyes refused to focus but nevertheless latched weakly onto his form. \"I know not where she is, little one, but you are safe here,\" Hades' rusty tenor reassured her. \"May I ask your name?\" With a faint smile, she softly answered, \"Persephone,\" before slipping back into sleep. After a moment, the Lord gathered her in his arms and strode towards his personal abode. He had every intention of protecting the girl, discovering exactly how she had managed to appear in his realm, and perhaps learning more about his unexpected, if delightful, guest. Whatever the reason, he claimed responsibility for her until otherwise stated, and with any luck, this whole situation would be settled quickly, peacefully, and with only a small amount of disaster. And perhaps, he thought wistfully, she might even stay. Despite hopes to the contrary, such a lovely young thing would never wish to stay in the Land of the Dead. But it is only a fool's dream...",

    "text": "Olympus in the aftermath of Hera's departure is a battlefield of scorching arguments. Athena is furious, indignant at what she deems the queen's betrayal. \"She is nothing but a selfish wretch seeking attention.\" She demands that Zeus determine proper punishment upon Hera's 'inevitable return'. \"It is the principle of things,\" she says, \"justice.\" \"Where was your justice when Zeus broke his vows to his marriage bed?\" sweet Hebe with her innocent grace spears Athena with a searing glare and hot headed Ares doesn't even bother to hold back a snort of laughter when Athena sputters her answer. \"Zeus is king!\" \"And my mother was his queen.\" The sons and daughters of Hera sit apart from the rest of the gods. They have been called to Olympus and interrogated for days now but none spoke a word against their mother. \"She's not coming back.\" Hephaestus says rising to his feet, \"Please do not look for her.\" And he turns to leave, his siblings trailing after him, they do not look at Zeus. The anticipated chaos in the mortal world never comes, man's constant stream of prayers are being answered swiftly, blessings dealt efficiently. Hera has taken care that the gods could fault her for nothing but her absence upon the throne. Zeus sits alone, bathed in the golden light of his court, back straight, regal, and spends the day weaving apologies in his mind. He knows not what to say to his family divided; half of Olympus has offered him felicitations, Dionysus bringing him a pitcher of his finest brew, the others regard him with silent condemnation, and Zeus cannot bring himself to meet Hestia's look of pity. Iris takes her leave abruptly. \"My place was with her majesty and now it is with her children.\" Hebe waits for her at the foot of the stairs and Ares leads them away under his comforting arms. Hera's children set not a foot upon Olympus though Zeus longs to see them. Please, he prays, to whom he does not know, please. They avoid him as though he is a leper, each closed door, every cold shoulder chewing bits of his heart until it is nothing but a bloody, pulpy mess and he thinks his head might twist off his shoulders if he never sees Hera again. She was thorough with the cleansing of her existence, nowhere could he find any misplaced possession, catch a whiff of her scent. He locks himself inside his room (not theirs anymore, she's gone) and weeps. Hades comes to court once and gives him an indifferent shrug. They sit side by side on the edge of the marble fountain; the king of the underworld has no sympathy for him. \"She had been unhappy for a long time.\" Two summers pass and Hera does not return. Athena's fury has melted into a viscous mire of worry and she urges Zeus to search for her. Don't you think I've tried? He wants to scream, but he can't because he is king and Hera means nothing--except she does, she means everything and he thinks if he says her name out loud he might break in front of them all. He visits Hephaestus, hoping, hoping... They sit across from each other, both broken men, Zeus opens his mouth but Hephaestus speaks first. \"Please stop looking for her.\" His voice is low and gravelly, he is wary of the king. \"Do you know where she is?\" He is hopeful, so, so hopeful. \"No,\" it's an old conversation and Hephaestus is tired of repeating himself, \"but I'd like to think that she is happy.\" Zeus nods, he likes to think so too.",

In the flicker of her torchlight, each wall is identical - hard grey stone carved into the heart of the mountain. Anyone but her would be lost in the twisting tunnels, never again to see the light of day. An army of men could search this forsaken place for a lifetime and never find anything but unyielding stone. No one but her would dare to enter. Right, right, left... The knowledge of the labyrinth's secret was a hard won prize for her; wrested from Daedalus' son Icarus with her words and her mouth and her body. Locked in his tower with his father, he had not seen a woman for years. Even still, he did not give up the secrets of his father's maze easily. Only when she had him on his knees, head in her hands, begging her to be his... only then did he give her what she sought. But she had to know; had to see him for herself. The shame and terror of Crete. The horror of which mothers warn their children in the night, and men fear to mention aloud lest ill omens follow them. Asterion. The minotaur. Her brother.Left, left, straight, right, left... By now she knows the route by heart, stamped indelibly upon her memory by a hundred repetitions. Her heart beats faster in her chest as each twist and turn brings her closer. He knows she is here. She can hear him breathing ahead. He can smell her. He knows her scent; knows the soft whisper of her footfalls on the rough-hewn, granite floor. Not like the panicked scramble of the sacrifices that come to feed him.Right, left, right. She is here. She stands in the doorway, looking into the darkness of the cavernous chamber. Her torch's light cannot pierce the deep darkness of this place, the heart of the labyrinth. Along the walls, piles of bones, picked clean, lie scattered haphazardly. Slowly, she steps inside the chamber. He's here. She can feel him watching her. She trembles with need. It has been so long. Only in the dark of the new moon does she feel safe attempting to enter here without being seen. Being caught would mean certain death. \"Brother...\" she says, without fear in her voice, \"I'm here.\" His breathing is close now, and louder. She can feel the force of it stirring the air. She can smell him approach, dank and musty, but not unpleasant. With a snort he emerges from the darkness, his massive frame looming over her. Thick, copperish hair covers the muscles of his body. His breathing is hard and fast, belying his excitement. He moves towards her cautiously. She places the torch in a metal holder on the wall and waits patiently for him to approach. \"Have you missed me?\" she asks, the ghost of a smile crossing her lips. He does not understand her, but it pleases her to imagine he does. He leans down, his bovine nose sniffing and snuffling at her, pressing against the bare skin of her neck, taking in her scent. Her hand reaches out to him and he flinches only slightly. She traces her fingers over the hard bulges of his muscular arms. There is a fresh wound there. Most likely a lucky blow by some recent victim, now no more than carrion bones. She continues upwards over the fur of his neck and up further still to his face. She pets him gently, the thick fur soft beneath her fingers. Her hand runs over the smooth bone of his horns, up to the sharpened tips. He presses against her, forcing her backward. He's growing impatient. His thick, swelling erection pushes against the thin fabric of her nightgown, warm against her stomach. \"So forceful...\" she says with a smile, \"...so strong. You did miss me, brother.\" His cock grows harder and her hand reaches down to stroke it. He huffs and pushes against her, but she knows he will not force her. Not until she allows it. \"I missed you,\" she whispers. His hands grasp her hips, pulling her into him, his cock caught between them. It is fully swollen now, and it juts up obscenely, the tip of it rubbing against her breasts. She looks up into his milky, bloodshot eyes. \"Fuck me...\" she whispers. This he understands. The response is immediate, the change in his demeanor uncanny. He roars savagely and shoves her back. With immense strength he lifts her lithe frame, shoving her against the wall. She gasps as the breath is knocked from her lungs, and before she has a chance to catch it he is crushing her, shoving his heavy, hirsute body against her porcelain skin. She feels herself being lifted higher. Harsh, quick thrusts of his giant cock probe at the front of her gown. With no effort at all he spreads her legs wide. Her mind reels with his power as she manages to reach down and lift her dress, revealing her slick cunt in the faint torchlight. Within a moment he has found her entrance, and within another he is forcing himself into her. There is pain, agonizing pain. His thick shaft was not made for her, not made for any mortal woman; only a goddess could possibly withstand his might and size without fear of pain and blood. But there is pleasure, too, indescribable and deep, welling up inside her as his massive cock invades her body, thrusting into her over and over again. His rage is insatiable as he forces himself on her, and she goes limp in his arms. She knows that trying to direct his primal lust would be like trying to steer a hurricane. It was a lesson she learned the hard way. Explaining the broken bones to her father had been tricky. Now she is content to be used, buffeted about by animal instincts out of her control. His rutting lasts for an eternity, thrusting over and over inside of her channel, slick with her own blood and juices. She grinds her hips against him as best she can, trying to take all of him inside of her, though she knows it would never be possible. Finally he roars out his triumph into the echoing labyrinth as his seed spills out, filling the emptiness inside of her. She screams with him, lost in her own animal needs, clawing at the thick skin of his hide like a wild thing. As his monstrous semen bathes her womb she climaxes, her vision going black as the new moon, her consciousness all but fading. Afterwards he sleeps. He is always tired after fucking her. She lies next to him, sore and spent on the cold, hard floor. Her hand rests on his side, feeling the powerful rise and fall of his chest as he breathes. \"Brother...\" she says aloud, and he does not stir. \"Our time is ending.\" She shivers. The chill of the dank labyrinth is only partially at fault. \"A man has come to Knossos. He is strong and wise. His name is Theseus.\" She lowers her head. \"I love him...\" she whispers. It is the first time she has admitted it to herself. The first time she has said it out loud. \"We were never meant to be. He will kill you, and I will help him. It was written in the stars, long ago.\" She knows it is true. She has read the signs and consulted the oracle. There is no other way. She knows better than to defy the will of fate. That way leads only to death and madness. She will not share the fate of Oedipus. \"For what it's worth... I'm sorry.\" Carefully, quietly, she stands on shaky legs. Warm come dries against her thighs. She takes the torch from the wall and looks down at her brother, her lover, her god, one final time. \"I love you, brother,\" she says. She turns and leaves, and once again the only sound that echoes through the labyrinth is the steady breathing of a sleeping beast.",

    "text": "Hades could smell growth in her hair as he kissed her neck and took her crown of gold from her dark braided hair. She leaned back into him as his hands worked into her hair, loosening it so it fell down her back like soil upon a new grave. Today had been long, many new deaths from Greeks fighting Greeks, he was sick of seeing the young. They had never truly been young, they were forever but he could feel her starting to reach up towards the sun, away from him. Persephone, his queen turned to kiss him undoing the clasps on his robe as he unfastened the clasps of golden wheat that held her chiton until they were naked before each other. He never tired of her beauty, the way she held life within her, reminding all that looked upon her that light and dark were both needed. Her kiss still tasted of pomegranate after all these years and she stroked him as he grew hard at the sight of her and her want of him. As he took a breath to speak, she kissed him again, hard enough that he thought he would fall at her touch that never ceased.. When he was against the foot of the bed, she whispered into his ear, \"Don't speak of tomorrow. There is only tonight.\" He groaned, he could never forget that tomorrow meant she returned to the sun and the growing world once more, but she could make him forget. She laughed at his groan before pushing him farther back onto the bed, letting her hair run over him as she kissed and teased him. After all these centuries, she knew every part of him and how to show that she loves him and chooses to be his wife. He lost track of how many times he came at her touch, at her lips, inside her. Nights in the Underworld could stretch out as long as he wished them to, but even this night must end with the calling of the sun.",

    "text": "Persephone was depressed, and Hades had no idea how to fix her. The goddess he had fallen in love with had been a beautiful, laughing maiden who loved playing with her companions - as his queen, he had envisioned her brightness magnified tenfold in the darkness of the underworld, not dimmed almost to nothingness. She had remained in the rooms he had prepared for her - temporary rooms, of course, she would share his before too long - and refused to come out when he summoned her. The situation was growing dire. Demeter was throwing a tantrum of epic proportions up on the surface, so no doubt Zeus would cave under the pressure soon and demand that Hades return his rightfully-stolen bride. He needed to have secured her place in the underworld before that happened, but how was he supposed to do that when the woman wouldn't so much as look at him? What did maiden goddesses like, anyways? Hades tried flowers, first. He ordered a few of his dead servants to go and pick bouquets of asphodels from the meadows, and sent them in with the meals that Persephone never touched. The maids reported that she'd taken one look at them and curled up on her bed, sobbing, for the rest of the evening. Jewelry was next, as precious gems covered abounded in the underworld. Hades himself selected the finest that his miners brought him, and had rubies set into the eye sockets of a fine diamond skull pendant, the twin of the necklace he himself wore. That one he took to Persephone himself, only to have it flung rudely into his helmet of invisibility. It took three days to get the dent out. He was lounging on his throne, at his complete wits' end - and still disgruntled about the helmet dent besides - when Hecate walked in with a basket of squirming, three-headed newborn hellhound pups. Though very soon they would be colossal and slavering, with many rows of deadly sharp teeth, they were still harmless as of yet. And perhaps, Hades thought, something that a goddess would like as a present? He remembered when he had been presented with Cerberus, when he'd taken over the underworld. It had been a good feeling, and the queen of the underworld should have her own hound. Perhaps it would make her feel as if she belonged. Transferring a small, chesnut-colored bitch pup to her own basket, Hades had Hecate deliver the present to Persephone, making sure that she knew the present was from him, no matter that Hecate was the hound-mistress of the underworld and had given him the idea in the first place. A month later, Hades caught the two goddesses walking in the courtyard, the considerably-larger hellpup tight to Persephone's heels. The girl had deigned to leave her rooms, and was actually smiling! Hades felt like his plans were finally coming to fruition, and approached Persephone with a pomegranate and uncharacteristically sweet words organizing themselves in his mind. Before he could manage to say anything, however, the bitch snarled and charged him, a hundred or so pounds of solid muscle landing squarely on his chest. Three heads bared teeth mere inches from his nose, and Hades was so shocked that anything in his kingdom would dare attack him that he just laid there and stared. Lovely musical laughter, the likes he had not heard since last autumn, echoed off the stone walls and ceiling. Looking past the hellhound and his own wounded pride, Persephone stood laughing, her mouth curled up in a cruel grin, eyes flashing in defiance. \"Oh, Hades. If a queen of the underworld is what you wanted, that should have been what you expected to get.\"",

XI Her conversation with Hephaestus is full of pain and regret and he is still so very angry, but relents and folds himself into his mother's tearful embrace.

    "text": "Bare feet walked softly through the soft grass, past the vast amount of flowers in various colours, carrying they owner with silent steps towards a small forest hidden in a small valley. Stars glistered like a million diamonds on the dark blue velvet of the night sky. There was no sound except the warm spring wind gliding through the lush grass, white marble ruins. The figure stopped for a few minutes, gazing up at the sky with emerald green eyes, listening to the wind before continuing they way towards the valley. The nearer the valley become one could even more clearly notice a faint melody mixed into the breeze sweeping through the paradise granted only for few. Soon the meadows become a forest filled with the melody of a lyre as the ancient trees opened into a clearing in which's middle a lake sparkled, like a mirror reflecting the stars and moon. \"Shouldn't you be in bed already? You know that if you appear tired tomorrow will you only be fretted over.\" said a smooth, deep voice which drew a soft smile on pale rose coloured lips. \"I went to your room to make sure that you don't have any nightmares and found your empty so I went to look for you.\" come the honest reply as the figure neared the one sitting on a rock by the lake, the moon's light only highlighting his long silver hair and matching coloured eyes. There was a chuckle before silver and emerald gazed into each other. \"I wanted for you to spend a night in your own bed, without needing to come to mine and taking care of my problems.\" he replied placing the lyre on the ground as the other reached him, soft hands gently cupping his face, they gazes never leaving that of the other. \"You have deled with those nightmares since the Age of Myth yourself, not telling anyone or asking for they help.\" come the stern voice filled with both worry and gentleness. It was so familiar to a voice he had heard in the past, the voice of a mortal princess he had adored, but wasn't allowed to have even in her death, but now if one would make him choose between the two of them, he knew whom he would choose. \"That didn't stop you from finding out.\" he grumbled, arms wrapped around the small waist, pulling the slender body against himself so that his head was resting on the other's heart which beat in a gentle, calming rhythm as long fingers played with his hair. Sometimes was it kind of hard to fully believe that this slender, fragile body belonged to a man instead of a woman and that truly how much strength lay hidden behind the merciful, pure nature for the man he was holding in his arms had truly the purest soul he had ever encountered. \"True and I'm glad that I did.\" was the gently reply before the hands withdrew from the silver strains and instead wrapping themselves around his shoulders and a small part of his neck, they hold protective, but still gentle. \"Every creature needs sometime to rely on someone else to be there for them no matter if they are mortal or divine, so this goes for you to Thanatos.\" he could only smile at the determined tone with which the other had said these words. \"You are nosy Saint of Athena.\" the God of Death said before pulling the emerald haired male into his lap, gently kissing the pale rose coloured lips. \"Though this is one of your traits which are an usual attribute for those dedicated to the Gods.\" he said smirking at the beautiful creature that had stepped into his life and this time he had made sure that nothing could come between them as he had claimed the others innocence on this very shore in Elysium. Thus according to ancient law if a God or Goddess should claim a mortal's innocence in Elysium out of love, after the virginal blood creates a new flower type as proof of that feeling, has the divinity a right to claim that person as they immortal consort. Though till now had no one knowledge about what he had done in the time the Saint lived at the Twin Temples to fulfil the contract which request that he lives from spring till the start of fall in the Underworld to serve as a councillor for Lord Hades. \"And here I thought that you thought that it was one of my charms.\" the young saint laughed while cuddling closer to the God, not fearing that the other was a personification of death itself or his dislike against mortals, he knew why that was and to be truthful, they are making good progress with that one. \"I think that would take us all night and even though I love gazing at mother's work I don't want for you to get into trouble with your sister in the morning, not to mention Lord Hades.\" Thanatos said with a small sigh, he knew that he was kind of acting out of character, but he couldn't help it if near the other, only a single touch was enough to calm his rage. \"It is fine, she is with your brother\" he replied with a knowing smirk and Thanatos could not do anything other then to return it, during the eighteenth century was he ready to grab Pandora push her into a room then grab his twin, throw him in the same room an lock the door telling Hypnos to man up and decide already what he wants. The only ground he didn't do it and endured his brother's annoying confusion about if he should act on his interest in the mortal woman or to try discharging the feelings because of his brother, - in all honesty, he would not have cared if Hypnos would have picked the former-, was because he feared if it worked to well then he would need to do the whole finding Hades-sama and making everything ready for the Holly War alone. He now kind of knew that he had made the right decision, those two constantly disappeared together at nights seeing how Pandora lived in the Twin Temples whenever her \"little brother\" was here. His thoughts were interrupted by soft, warm lips pressing against his cold ones, well he was the personification of death and corpses don't exactly count as warm, but that never seemed to bother his lover. \"Shun.\" he tried again, even if Pandora would be half asleep tomorrow when they need to appear in the throne room that didn't mean that Lord Hades would not question why his former host looked tired, the Lord of the Underworld had developed a deep attachment to his last host. \"We won't stay long I promise, it is just that I'm back here since nearly a month and beside laying in your arms in the nights is it as if you are avoiding me.\" his tone held a little sadness in it mixed with a tint of fear. This was kind of the main ground Shun had come out here to the lake, he was worried that he had done something to displease the God or the worse scenario about which he didn't dare thinking was that he had seen him as a replacement for Andromeda whose cloth he wore and was now discharging him after realizing that he was noting like the young woman who first managed to touch the heart of Death. \"Shun\" Thanatos said as he gently pushed the other away, noticing the pain in those lovely emerald eyes but he only grabbed one of the other's hands an placed a small flower into it. The flower had diamond shaped light pink petals trimmed with silver, the soft petals formed a star like shape. \"You remember what I said about this flower?\" Thanatos inquired as a small blush appeared on his lover's cheeks when he nodded, his eyes on the flower. \"You said that this was the result of...\" his cheeks reddened even further as memories about that night from two years ago come to him, the gentle creases, heated touches, hungry kisses under the starry night sky. Thanatos only smirked at the other's embarrassment, easily reading his thoughts from his eyes, it pleased him that they first night together as lovers meant so much to him mate. Reaching out he gently pulled the other against his body, pressing a gentle kiss on his forehead and lips. \"These flowers are proff of me claiming you as mine and I intend to not let anyone your overprotective and annoying older brother in the front\" at this Shun couldn't help himself then to giggle as he remembered how Ikki had argued with the God when he come to pick up Shun for the first time to fulfil his part of the peace treaty\" that I wish to have you at my side for all eternity. I'm sorry if I may have given you the impression that I have lost interest in you, it is only that I was kind of stunned that I have met another person who could touch my heart and make me love them even more then anyone other before them.\" at hearing those words Shun looked up, his eyes wide and innocent as they gazed up into silver ones which could be cold and cutting like steel, but this time they were warm like liquid silver as they gazed down at him. \"You heard me Shun, if one of the other Gods would ever give me a chance to have Andromeda at my side I would decline without hesitation, because you are the one who holds my heart now in they hands, true a part of is will be forever with her, but you are my lover, the one I chose to be my mate and consort.\" the God of Death finished before kissing his mate while gently whipping away the tears of happiness staining the soft cheeks. The two of them could stay for ten more minutes before heading back to the temples and going to bed to get some sleep, beside that had Thanatos still five months to find ways for the two of them to be alone so that he could make up for neglecting his lover. He will certainly not mind the making up part that was for sure, as for being left alone, well he could ask Shun get Pandora to try out her new bikini in her bedroom why he gets his brother in there with a trick, that would certainly eliminate the problem of they siblings bothering them. Though for now was it time to enjoy the fact that he was holding his young lover as they shared a deep kiss with another. Owari",

    "text": "They sang of you, from Thrace to Crete. They sing of you still, but with laughter, now: the girl who challenged a goddess. The girl who was tossed from the arms of Athena to scuttle in corners and frighten children, that proud, headstrong thing. The songs have it wrong. - You were proud, yes. You will admit that. But how could you not be proud? The nymphs themselves stopped their play to come watch you weave. The people in your village would stare, too, as thread bent like sunlight in your hands. Arachne, they whispered, awe weighing down their words. The best mortal weaver in our land. In the world! You tucked their words inside you with pleasure. In time, the watchers came from farther and farther, nobles and kings and even emperors who murmured that you were almost as skilled as the goddess Athena herself. By then your pride had swollen, a poisonous, bloated thing nestled inside your mind, and you laughed. Almost? I am better than anyone. - She stood there, grey-eyed and olive-skinned, her dark hair curling over her shoulders, and your mouth went dry. Your heartbeat fluttered beneath the fragile skin of your throat, and desire flamed dry and hot in your belly. Cruel Aphrodite, you thought, to strike me now! You wanted to sit at her feet like a cat. You ached to put your head on her knee, to do whatever she asked. You would have been hers for a single word. She offered only a hard-eyed look, and said, \"A contest, mortal?\" - They say it was pride that drove you to weave a prettier tapestry than hers, and mock the gods. You know better. It was love. You wanted to give her the best, a thing that no one else could. Your reward: eight legs.",

    "text": "Anteros lies on the grass and soaks in the remains of pale sunlight while they argue inside his mother's palace. Even out here in the garden with the sea wind combating with their voices, he can hear everything just fine. \"I didn't send you down there to fall in love,\" Aphrodite yells. Even though she is angry, her words sound like honey. \"Your brother is bad enough,\" Ares, the accompanying hornet's nest, \"Why even bother with her? A mortal, Eros! They're all vain, they're useless objects.\"Anteros sits up to look out at the ocean and his toga falls a little loose on bronze shoulders. The waves are in an angry white fit, but here in the long blades of grass, Anteros has no reason to worry about the tossing and turning of other gods. It's not that he doesn't care about Eros' sudden interest in this girl, Psyche. It's just that he knows better than to expect anything from his brother. Besides, how can the dispute go anywhere when Ares is a hypocrite? When Aphrodite is so beautiful in her envy? As for his brother, Eros is Eros. Eros. \"You're just jealous. Both of you,\" he says, amused as always, \"You're getting possessive, so of course I have an interest in her.\" They're talking in circles. Such is the way with Love, Rage, and Beauty. If Ares is allowed to sneak off with Achilles, why should Eros be denied a pretty and simple girl? Aphrodite only protests because she sent Eros to do her dirty work and he got other ideas. Psyche is rumored to be beautiful, as beautiful as the goddess, but what does that really matter? Aphrodite knows that mortals all eventually wither, they all die. Anteros is beginning to believe Ares' influence has made his mother crave blood. As he did with Eros, as Anteros was unable to provide save with copper skin and endless, endless wine. For this reason, though, Anteros believes also that it will pass like the waves pulling away from the white shores. The lull of angry dialogue is lost to the sigh of the ocean now that the afternoon brings the tide closer. Anteros wonders for a fleeting moment what it would be like to have real arguments. The kind that mortals deal with. He has heard of clever hero kings who battle with the ocean gods, but because they are clever they know to flee. Abandoning dignity is supposedly better than to take arms against a sea of troubles, or so those clever kings might say. In the meantime, though, Anteros is only here in Aphrodite's garden with a craving for a king of his own. Not for blood, but something too similar; a dead ruler's caress. In the winter, though, he can only want what he cannot have. This is why he avoids seeing Psyche. It's bad enough that Eros describes the Spring in her eyes and the flowers in her hair, Anteros doesn't want to have to see the blush on her white skin and think of something freshly blooming. He doesn't need to draw any more similarities. At least she is mortal. At least she must face the reasons that Eros might have to leave her. Reasons that all have pouting lips, perfect bones, and ichor in their veins. Anteros might even be among those reasons. He doesn't realize Love is in the garden until he casts a long shadow across his thighs and face. Anteros can only smile up at him through gold curls. \"You're not angry, are you Anteros?\" This is not asked in concern. It's purely for the sake of redundancy, Love's only flaw. \"I know better,\" Anteros yawns. Love cuts an inviting silhouette out of the sky. His hair is disheveled, his cheeks flush with the rare experience of an argument. Even though Anteros is tired and bitter, he finds himself wondering at what it would feel like to stand and reach possessively at those curls. Grab that jaw and pull him into a forceful kiss for once. \"I know better than to bother. Complaining about what you do only serves to encourage you to do it,\" Anteros says, \"I think I ought to know, after all, I'm the same way.\"Eros crouches beside his brother in the grass. He leans forward just enough for his breath to ghost against Anteros' ear. \"I think you're my favorite.\" \"Doubtless.\" Anteros kisses his brother's neck and sucks at the thin layer pale skin. There is a lack of pretense in the way he trails his lips down to his collarbone and how Eros groans softly. They fall against the grass, Anteros' arms on either side of Eros' head. Love grins up at his almost twin just before they kiss, tongues fighting against each other. Anteros feels his brother's legs lock around his hips and he grinds against him through too much cloth. Why does Eros even bother to wear anything at all, especially this flimsy white robe? He finds himself fumbling with the tie. Eros is fighting with his brother's toga. There is the sound of ripping cloth followed by Anteros' dull realization that there are tatters of useless material on his body now. Eros wriggles the rest of the way out of the robe and they crash into another kiss, nude in the soft grass. Anteros resumes his trail of licks and starts pulling up skin at Love's hips. He laps at Eros's inner thighs, the base of his already hard cock. It swells under his tongue. Anteros swallows Love's wet cock, feels the head slam against the back of his throat with the relentless and harsh buck of hips. Eros' fingers tangle into his brother's hair, pulling him down on his cock. When he glances down, Love sees his thick cock slide in and out of Anteros' lush lips while he jacks himself off in time with Eros' thrusts. \"Faster,\" he croaks just as Anteros licks up pearls of precum. To his disbelief, his brother's pace instead becomes maddeningly slow. He licks a long, careful stripe from the base of Eros' slick cock to its engorged head so that Eros is almost painfully aware of how fucking good it feels. \"Anteros, come on,\" Eros whines, almost begs. Anteros slides up his brother's body, making their cocks grind against each other. \"You'll come,\" he bites at Eros' neck. Love groans. \"And then it will be over. You'll abandon me, like you do with her.\" Anteros licks his cheek. His fingers wrap around Eros' cock and the love god mumbles something incoherent, but angry. \"What do - y-yes, there, do that again- you want, Ant-ah- Anteros?\" He demands just as Anteros twists his wrist. \"What do you want?\" Anteros seems to consider the question for a moment. He spreads his legs a little more, straddling Eros so that his brother's cock, wet with his own saliva, is pressing against his taint.He leans forward and kisses Eros so long that Love wonders if this is even a kiss. Then his lips are at the shell of Love's ear. \"Fuck me.\" Eros can barely scrape three letters together to make a faint syllable. \"Yes.\" He reaches up, a hand tracing from the nape of Anteros' gold neck to the small of his back, then to his entrance. There isn't any oil out here, but Anteros doesn't seem to care. He leans into the fingers and soon Eros is pushing one, then two fingers inside of him. \"So tight,\" Eros almost sounds like he is laughing through his gasp. So the roles even out, because Anteros won't let them completely switch. Not now, even as those fingers scissor inside of him and his breaths start getting ragged. Anteros closes his eyes, moaning when Eros adds a third finger. He rocks his hips, fucking himself on Love's fingers. Eros very slowly pulls his fingers out, eliciting a complaining groan from the god above him. He strokes his already wet cock and guides it against Anteros as he spreads his legs for Eros. Love's cock slides inside of him and Anteros' head rolls back. He bucks his hips once and cries out at the sensation. Eros begins to move beneath him and they are both breathing so hard, so fast. Anteros tries to kiss Eros again, but he can barely keep his eyes open through the sweat and the feeling, the ecstasy of Eros pounding into him. It's because they fit together, were made for each other. Eros pumps his cock just a little faster and Anteros' hand flies to his own. Love's brother manages to get a kiss this time and they sigh into each other's mouths. Solid white and nothing else suddenly floods both gods' visions and Eros loses in spite of himself. He comes hard inside Anteros, whose lips are suddenly against his neck. He bites at Love's collarbone and the feeling of hot seed pumping inside of him is too much. His body goes taut as he comes and then collapses on top of Eros without any energy or muscle left in his entire being. Together they lay there cavernous, not truly sated. Neither of them dares to admit it aloud, but Anteros allows himself to wish he were somewhere else. He goes down to the ocean to be alone. At first, he is only greeted by the waves and Anteros eagerly falls into the ocean's grasp. Bathing in sea water may not be as good as the springs of water inside, or the shallow pools scented with juniper, but Anteros doesn't want to have to interact with servants or guests, or worse--Eros a second time. His now tattered excuses for clothing still lay upon the grass in the garden, out of his mind or concern. Visitors of Aphrodite very rarely even care about her sons, let alone him. He is at best a confusion to the rest of the world as they search to see his brother in him. When they can't, they move on. It's for this reason that Anteros is startled when he sees a figure staring at him from the boulders in the garden. From this distance, though, he might look like his brother or even just one of the gold-skinned concubines Aphrodite has invented to live in her domain. He swallows salt water and turns back around to finish his bath unheeded by some voyeur. What does Anteros care? He still is who he is. Being wanted almost feels nice, almost. It might if he didn't loathe everyone here. When he comes up to the shore to dry off in the afternoon sun, the figure is gone. That night, Anteros goes to bed alone as he has done for the past three weeks of winter. Even the luxury of his canopy bed and the thousands of hyacinth flowers can't reconcile the fact that he is unattended. Again. He's asleep within minutes and dreams of the hunt, of the underground, of fire. He dreams he's covered in blood. Anteros wakes covered in sweat. He sits up shakily and tries his best to recover from the images that polluted his sleep. His breath is loud and he doesn't understand why his heart won't shut up, beat after beat until blood pounds against his eardrums. His mouth is dry. A familiar situation, almost a fond memory if the sting of what he can't have would go away. Anteros knows someone else is in the room. He glares into the dark, but through the fine fabric of the canopy it's impossible to know where the other god is, the moonlight refuses to look his way. Anteros still knows he's there; the only Olympian that could make him dream of blood on his tongue and want it, want it so fucking much. \"Ares, get out of my room. Eros is on the other side of the palace.\" His voice sounds like a rasp in his own ears. Anteros searches his bedside for a drink and finds his pitcher turned over. The wine has been spilling over the edge of the bed for some time now, if the stain on the marble is any indication. \"He left to be with her tonight.\" Anteros can't see him, but he can feel him. His room is usually full of easy night breeze and sweet nectar, but not tonight. Amber swirls and nearly suffocates him. It's hot; he's awake but still sweating as if the dreams hadn't stopped and he's still inside those fiery pits, clawing at the enemies he will never have. \"Then my mother. Or is she bored of you, too?\" \"No, I'm the one bored of her.\" That's a lie. No one ever gets bored of Beauty, not unless they have Ecstasy waiting in their bed. Ares doesn't, so why not go back to her? What is he doing here? Anteros finally sees him, standing in the corner by the doorway. There isn't any leather armor distorting his dark figure, but having a nude god in his room isn't much better than if Ares had been dressed for the battles his body is so clearly intended. Ares is still Ares. He tempts the idea of standing, but really? How even are the odds if he stands up to fight against War? At least this way maybe he can act like he isn't threatened. \"You don't believe me? Do you think your mother could really close her slut thighs to anyone? Let alone a god.\" \"If my brother can, why not her?\" he challenges as a reminder that just because he hasn't done anything yet does not mean he wants Ares' company. He's still bitter about before, about how Ares gets to have Eros when he doesn't. The fact that right now neither of them have him does not mean he feels an inkling of kinship with the war god. \"Go back to your own palace, Ares, and stay out of my head.\" Ares laughs. \"I didn't do that on purpose, you were already craving death,\" he says lowly and takes a step into the room. \"I just happen to be the next best thing. You already wanted it.\" Anteros reconsiders he decision to remain in the bed. He reaches at his bedside, completely knocking over the amphora of wine so that it shatters into a million porcelain shards. His fingers wrap around the object he was searching for; the club. \"Get out, Ares. This isn't some metaphorical toy like with Eros. You come near me, this is going to smash your head in.\"Ares, of course, walks further into the room. His knees touch the edge of the bed. Anteros inches up from the sheets as War brushes his fingers against the silk where his feet once were. \"You could have called the guards by now, if you wanted me gone,\" he says, \"but you don't and you won't.\" Anteros had not until now considered that Ares is being influenced by Love just as his mother was influenced by War. He knows exactly what he's doing. The love god can't stop picturing exactly what Ares wants him to as he strokes the sheets. Except that Anteros knows better, know it would be nothing like that. Not with Ares. \"You are not the next best thing, Ares. Get out of my room.\" He sounds desperate, he's supposed to sound angry. \"You're right, I'm not.\" He advances up the bed and Anteros is dismally aware of the fact that he wears nothing under the pooled silk sheets. \"I'm am the best thing, because you can't get to him. Not with your morals.\" Ares leans forward, reaches out to Anteros and the love god panics. He tries to swing the golden club at War, but is greeted with nothing but air. Air all around him and then a vice grip, a shift in weight on the bed. Anteros tenses, and after a moment understands that Ares is now kneeling behind him, pressed against him with an arm wrapped around his chest. It only takes one giant warrior arm to restrain him. When Anteros tries to struggle, his bare back meets Ares' chest and he shivers. What exactly it is that makes him shudder, however, he won't consider. War's breath is hot on the nape of his neck. Anteros drops the club. \"Come on, Anteros. Turn into smoke if that's what you want, I can't stop you,\" he dares. The sheets are slipping off of Anteros' thighs. He can feel the outline of Ares' hard cock underneath the cloth. \"You aren't him,\" Anteros hisses and in response, Ares grinds against him with urgency and violence Anteros wants to go on and go on. War drags his teeth along his shoulder. He bites back a sound he refuses to make for Ares' benefit. \"He'd never do anything like this.\" \"That's the point, Anteros. He wouldn't and it's what you want. It's what no one can give you,\" Ares says and licks a stripe around the shell of the love god's ear. Anteros swears. Did his brother tell War all his secrets? How does he know? His own cock starts to grow and thicken. \"It's what no one can give you but me.\" War's free arm travels down Anteros' body and wraps around his stiffening cock for emphasis. He's losing. Anteros is losing to Ares of all people. The god licks his lips and attempts to gain some courage despite having the warrior of all warriors holding him against his hard, immortal body. He could crush him without a second thought and Anteros isn't sure how that knowledge doesn't have him paralyzed. Another quaking breath escapes his parted lips when Ares pulls a little at his cock. \"I'm not him either, Ares.\" He inhales again, tries not to moan. \"I can't be my brother. What are you getting out of this?\"Ares' response comes in the form of the war god developing a slow, steady rhythm to jerking Anteros off. The love god answers his own question with a low, shaky inhale. \"You don't give yourself enough credit, Anteros,\" War says and perhaps from anyone else that might actually be a compliment. From Ares, though, Anteros doesn't trust it, especially not when the god's hand moves lower to massage his ballsack. Without considering what he's doing, Anteros lets his head go back against Ares' shoulder. War's body is hot against his bare, sweat slick skin, almost enough so that Anteros thinks he could burn him. It's so different, nothing like Hades. He barely acknowledges that Ares has let his other arm drop. He can run, if he wants to. He doesn't. Instead, he turns his shoulders to look War in the eye. God, he can see the fire there and the bloodlust. The destruction that Ares will always crave and that Anteros can feel on his tongue. It's addictive and too late to get away. In those eyes Anteros can see something else, too, something that will make this worth it. The power to destroy anything, even a memory and the ghost of a touch he's missed long enough. The promise that Ares can erase that need in him, make it spill out of him with the dark magic that is a murder. To do that, though, it can't be easy. It has to hurt just as much as any other sacrificial rite. \"Well?\" Anteros blinks and realizes that Ares has dropped his hand while he was waiting for--what? A reply? Permission? \"Hurry up, Ares, I don't have all night.\" Ares grunts and shoves him down the bed, crawling over Anteros before he can try to regain his position. War holds him down with one giant fist clasped over his shoulder, pressing him into the sheets while his other arm travels back down Anteros' struggling form. The love god refuses to submit to this level, but that's too bad because Ares is Ares. A wolf and an alpha male. His hand latches on to Anteros' hips and pulls him up so that the fair-haired immortal is forced on his knees, hands gripping the edge of the bed. Somewhere in the back of Anteros' mind, he realizes challenging War is not the best of ideas. Then Ares starts kissing him. First his neck, his shoulders next. Anteros' mouth opens when War starts lapping down the small of his back. Love's brother tries to take advantage of Ares' distraction and sit up or flip over, but Ares is there against him in a flash. Anteros drags his teeth over his lower lip when he feels the war god's cock pressing against his thigh, when he hears Ares panting into his ear. Then he starts talking. \"Come on, slut\", he says. Anteros feels his lips move down his neck, Ares pauses at his shoulder and drags his teeth there. He bites and Anteros cries out as he feels the blood drip down his back. \"You can do better than that. Beg.\" \"Who s-says you, ah, deserve better than that?\" His eyes shut when Ares starts lapping up the blood, he feels the war god's tongue dart into the freshly made wound. His fingers curl tighter into the sheets, twisting them as he searches for purchase. \"Stop struggling,\" Ares growls above him. Anteros feels something cool and flat against his back--a knife. \"I'll slit your throat.\" \"I'll heal.\" The knife slides down his back, then back up. Ares doesn't cut him, not yet, but Anteros wants him to. He needs that hollow, uncomplicated pain. War starts rocking his whole body in time with the knife, so that when it nearly scrapes his shoulder, Ares' cock slides against his entrance. Anteros doesn't feel like waiting and War doesn't know the meaning of patience, but he does know torture. Love's almost twin spreads his legs a little and hears Ares chuckle behind him. \"Like I said, a concubine at best.\" Nothing like anyone else he's ever been with, ever will be with. The knife presses against his spine and Anteros inhales sharply as it finally makes a cut. Slowly, too slowly Ares pulls the blade down. He can feel the war god's cock pressing between his thighs, too, and then against his entrance. The blade stays against his spine, still cutting into his flesh. The searing pain and overwhelming sensation of blood threatens to surpass his sense of self-respect. He moans Ares' name and doesn't have the concentration to hate himself for it. \"F-fuck.\" The only even slightly intelligible things that Anteros can manage are ragged, panted phrases. \"Fuck me, Ares, come on...\"War grinds against him, but doesn't press in any further. Anteros tries to raise his hips and feels himself open more to the night air. The demeaning position makes him feel like an offering about to be torn apart. Anteros wouldn't fight that kind of fate right now, if only Ares would just fuck him already. Instead, the blade disappears in a swift movement and then reappears in front of Anteros' lips. His own blood drips from it, close enough to smell and almost taste. At first, he thinks Ares will try to cut his face and he pulls away. There is a delicious sensation of his body pressed further against Ares, but still the war god won't move. He does, however, groan and Anteros smirks when he ears War moan his name. \"Lick it clean, Anteros.\" A rush goes through his body and though he didn't think it possible, his cock swells more. Precum leaks out when he leans forward and presses his tongue to the cool metal. Part of him is still demanding he that not obey Ares' orders, Ares who he can't stand, who stole from him- but the blood tastes delicious. The liquid is hot in his mouth and Ares doesn't even need to whisper for him to swallow, he does it just to feel the coppery liquid slide down his throat. Ares grinds against Anteros again, though he holds the knife steady. Anteros realizes the god's cock is already oiled and would hate his confidence if it didn't feel so amazing. The knife now clean and his lips stained with blood, he tries again. \"Fuck me, Ares.\" For emphasis, he reaches down and strokes himself, barely keeping balanced with his other arm. \"Do it, no preparation, just do it.\"War stares down at the sight in front of him. Anteros, usually slim and resolute in his virginal beauty pleasuring himself as the blood on his back dries. He licks his lips when Anteros does, unable to get enough of his own blood. He can't wait anymore. War drops the knife and angles his body, hips pressed against Anteros' tight ass and thrusts inside him.Anteros cries out, nearly howls at the sudden pain. It's what he wanted, practically begged for, but the rush of Ares forcing his way inside still leaves him rendered speechless. His moans are wet from blood and saliva and he can't even consider keeping quiet when Ares pushes the remaining inches of his cock inside. One of War's arms wraps around him to keep him steady. Ares groans into Anteros' ear and together they fill the room with the sound of skin against skin and pleasured, animalistic moans. Ares doesn't wait for the love god to adjust, he pulls out again and rams back in with a force bound to leave a mark. When Anteros cries out in shock, he doesn't bother to conceal his dark laughter. Anteros' throat is already dry again from panting. Fucking someone you hate, he realizes, is complicated. Every time he feels good, Ares laughs and he hates it. Every time he squeezes his ass and rocks back in time with Ares' thrust, the war god has to take a shallow gasp. It's tug and pull, winning and losing over and over again. He jerks himself off and bites his tongue to keep from gasping Ares' name again. The war god is unrelenting. Once Anteros is accustomed to the timing of his thrusts, Ares picks a new angle and fucks him even harder. The arm around Anteros' chest pulls him close enough to bruise, maybe even break ribs. Anteros just presses closer, riding the strokes as Ares pounds deeper and deeper into his ass. Ares sucks air in and Anteros can feel it, can feel how the thrusts stop having a rhythm altogether. It's too much, knowing how close Ares is. Anteros comes into his hand, followed shortly by Ares. The hot seed spills out onto his thighs and fills him in a way that Anteros has never loved as much as he does now. War pulls out of him slowly, letting him feel every inch as it leaves his body. Anteros knows he lost, but doesn't care. This will never happen again and Ares would be a fool to tell anyone. With semen and blood drying on his skin, Anteros feels spent, utterly used, but the hollowness is gone. \"God, you really are just a slut,\" War laughs, \"Worse than your brother. At least he doesn't pretend.\" He's too tired to argue, but Anteros forces himself to sit up from the stained sheets and spit in Ares' face. The war god doesn't flinch. He calmly wipes his face, eyes trained on Anteros. \"I think it's time everyone knew what you're really like,\" he says. Anteros tries to think of a protest, still too angry for it to be a plea but suddenly there is a sting in his stomach. Ares is grinning at him and Anteros looks down, confused to see the war god's arm extended into his gut. It takes a slow, painful moment to register that the knife is in War's hand again. The blade has disappeared into his stomach. \"Wh-\" \"Better take you somewhere to get healed,\" Ares chuckles. Anteros doesn't understand, but their surroundings blur and rush by, changing shape. The war god vanishes, along with the knife though the wound remains. Anteros holds his bare stomach and feels the blood seep through his fingers. He knows he's on a temple floor, but his vision is red at the edges when he tries to understand which one. Anteros feels blood bubble up in his mouth as he collapses back down. It's in a shaky breath that he smells it; a narcotic compound just as his head falls against the black marble, he knows what dark, underground tunnel he is passing out in. Ares abandoned him in the Necromanteion, temple of Hades and Persephone.",

      "He's losing.",
      "Anteros is losing to Ares of all people.",
      "The god licks his lips and attempts to gain some courage despite having the warrior of all warriors holding him against his hard, immortal body.",
      "He could crush him without a second thought and Anteros isn't sure how that knowledge doesn't have him paralyzed.",
      "Another quaking breath escapes his parted lips when Ares pulls a little at his cock.",
      "\"I'm not him either, Ares.\"",
      "He inhales again, tries not to moan.",
      "\"I can't be my brother.",
      "What are you getting out of this?\"Ares' response comes in the form of the war god developing a slow, steady rhythm to jerking Anteros off.",
      "The love god answers his own question with a low, shaky inhale.",
      "\"You don't give yourself enough credit, Anteros,\" War says and perhaps from anyone else that might actually be a compliment.",
      "From Ares, though, Anteros doesn't trust it, especially not when the god's hand moves lower to massage his ballsack.",
      "Without considering what he's doing, Anteros lets his head go back against Ares' shoulder.",
      "War's body is hot against his bare, sweat slick skin, almost enough so that Anteros thinks he could burn him.",
      "It's so different, nothing like Hades.",
      "He barely acknowledges that Ares has let his other arm drop.",
      "He can run, if he wants to.",
      "He doesn't.",
      "Instead, he turns his shoulders to look War in the eye.",
      "God, he can see the fire there and the bloodlust.",
      "The destruction that Ares will always crave and that Anteros can feel on his tongue.",
      "It's addictive and too late to get away.",
      "In those eyes Anteros can see something else, too, something that will make this worth it.",
      "The power to destroy anything, even a memory and the ghost of a touch he's missed long enough.",
      "The promise that Ares can erase that need in him, make it spill out of him with the dark magic that is a murder.",
      "To do that, though, it can't be easy.",
      "It has to hurt just as much as any other sacrificial rite.",
      "\"Well?\" Anteros blinks and realizes that Ares has dropped his hand while he was waiting for--what?",
      "A reply?",
      "Permission?",
      "\"Hurry up, Ares, I don't have all night.\"",
      "Ares grunts and shoves him down the bed, crawling over Anteros before he can try to regain his position.",
      "War holds him down with one giant fist clasped over his shoulder, pressing him into the sheets while his other arm travels back down Anteros' struggling form.",
      "The love god refuses to submit to this level, but that's too bad because Ares is Ares.",
      "A wolf and an alpha male.",
      "His hand latches on to Anteros' hips and pulls him up so that the fair-haired immortal is forced on his knees, hands gripping the edge of the bed.",
      "Somewhere in the back of Anteros' mind, he realizes challenging War is not the best of ideas.",
      "Then Ares starts kissing him.",
      "First his neck, his shoulders next.",
      "Anteros' mouth opens when War starts lapping down the small of his back.",
      "Love's brother tries to take advantage of Ares' distraction and sit up or flip over, but Ares is there against him in a flash.",
      "Anteros drags his teeth over his lower lip when he feels the war god's cock pressing against his thigh, when he hears Ares panting into his ear.",
      "Then he starts talking.",
      "\"Come on, slut\", he says.",
      "Anteros feels his lips move down his neck, Ares pauses at his shoulder and drags his teeth there.",
      "He bites and Anteros cries out as he feels the blood drip down his back.",
      "\"You can do better than that.",
      "Beg.\"",
      "\"Who s-says you, ah, deserve better than that?\"",
      "His eyes shut when Ares starts lapping up the blood, he feels the war god's tongue dart into the freshly made wound.",
      "His fingers curl tighter into the sheets, twisting them as he searches for purchase.",
      "\"Stop struggling,\" Ares growls above him.",
      "Anteros feels something cool and flat against his back--a knife.",
      "\"I'll slit your throat.\"",
      "\"I'll heal.\"",
      "The knife slides down his back, then back up.",
      "Ares doesn't cut him, not yet, but Anteros wants him to.",
      "He needs that hollow, uncomplicated pain.",
      "War starts rocking his whole body in time with the knife, so that when it nearly scrapes his shoulder, Ares' cock slides against his entrance.",
      "Anteros doesn't feel like waiting and War doesn't know the meaning of patience, but he does know torture.",
      "Love's almost twin spreads his legs a little and hears Ares chuckle behind him.",
      "\"Like I said, a concubine at best.\"",
      "Nothing like anyone else he's ever been with, ever will be with.",
      "The knife presses against his spine and Anteros inhales sharply as it finally makes a cut.",
      "Slowly, too slowly Ares pulls the blade down.",
      "He can feel the war god's cock pressing between his thighs, too, and then against his entrance.",
      "The blade stays against his spine, still cutting into his flesh.",
      "The searing pain and overwhelming sensation of blood threatens to surpass his sense of self-respect.",
      "He moans Ares' name and doesn't have the concentration to hate himself for it.",
      "\"F-fuck.\"",
      "The only even slightly intelligible things that Anteros can manage are ragged, panted phrases.",
      "\"Fuck me, Ares, come on...\"War grinds against him, but doesn't press in any further.",
      "Anteros tries to raise his hips and feels himself open more to the night air.",
      "The demeaning position makes him feel like an offering about to be torn apart.",
      "Anteros wouldn't fight that kind of fate right now, if only Ares would just fuck him already.",
      "Instead, the blade disappears in a swift movement and then reappears in front of Anteros' lips.",
      "His own blood drips from it, close enough to smell and almost taste.",
      "At first, he thinks Ares will try to cut his face and he pulls away.",
      "There is a delicious sensation of his body pressed further against Ares, but still the war god won't move.",
      "He does, however, groan and Anteros smirks when he ears War moan his name.",
      "\"Lick it clean, Anteros.\"",
      "A rush goes through his body and though he didn't think it possible, his cock swells more.",
      "Precum leaks out when he leans forward and presses his tongue to the cool metal.",
      "Part of him is still demanding he that not obey Ares' orders, Ares who he can't stand, who stole from him-",
      "but the blood tastes delicious.",
      "The liquid is hot in his mouth and Ares doesn't even need to whisper for him to swallow, he does it just to feel the coppery liquid slide down his throat.",
      "Ares grinds against Anteros again, though he holds the knife steady.",
      "Anteros realizes the god's cock is already oiled and would hate his confidence if it didn't feel so amazing.",
      "The knife now clean and his lips stained with blood, he tries again.",
      "\"Fuck me, Ares.\"",
      "For emphasis, he reaches down and strokes himself, barely keeping balanced with his other arm.",
      "\"Do it, no preparation, just do it.\"War stares down at the sight in front of him.",
      "Anteros, usually slim and resolute in his virginal beauty pleasuring himself as the blood on his back dries.",
      "He licks his lips when Anteros does, unable to get enough of his own blood.",
      "He can't wait anymore.",
      "War drops the knife and angles his body, hips pressed against Anteros' tight ass and thrusts inside him.Anteros cries out, nearly howls at the sudden pain.",
      "It's what he wanted, practically begged for, but the rush of Ares forcing his way inside still leaves him rendered speechless.",
      "His moans are wet from blood and saliva and he can't even consider keeping quiet when Ares pushes the remaining inches of his cock inside.",
      "One of War's arms wraps around him to keep him steady.",
      "Ares groans into Anteros' ear and together they fill the room with the sound of skin against skin and pleasured, animalistic moans.",
      "Ares doesn't wait for the love god to adjust, he pulls out again and rams back in with a force bound to leave a mark.",
      "When Anteros cries out in shock, he doesn't bother to conceal his dark laughter.",
      "Anteros' throat is already dry again from panting.",
      "Fucking someone you hate, he realizes, is complicated.",
      "Every time he feels good, Ares laughs and he hates it.",
      "Every time he squeezes his ass and rocks back in time with Ares' thrust, the war god has to take a shallow gasp.",
      "It's tug and pull, winning and losing over and over again.",
      "He jerks himself off and bites his tongue to keep from gasping Ares' name again.",
      "The war god is unrelenting.",
      "Once Anteros is accustomed to the timing of his thrusts, Ares picks a new angle and fucks him even harder.",
      "The arm around Anteros' chest pulls him close enough to bruise, maybe even break ribs.",
      "Anteros just presses closer, riding the strokes as Ares pounds deeper and deeper into his ass.",
      "Ares sucks air in and Anteros can feel it, can feel how the thrusts stop having a rhythm altogether.",
      "It's too much, knowing how close Ares is.",
      "Anteros comes into his hand, followed shortly by Ares.",
      "The hot seed spills out onto his thighs and fills him in a way that Anteros has never loved as much as he does now.",
      "War pulls out of him slowly, letting him feel every inch as it leaves his body.",
      "Anteros knows he lost, but doesn't care.",
      "This will never happen again and Ares would be a fool to tell anyone.",
      "With semen and blood drying on his skin, Anteros feels spent, utterly used, but the hollowness is gone.",
      "\"God, you really are just a slut,\" War laughs, \"Worse than your brother.",
      "At least he doesn't pretend.\"",
      "He's too tired to argue, but Anteros forces himself to sit up from the stained sheets and spit in Ares' face.",
      "The war god doesn't flinch.",
      "He calmly wipes his face, eyes trained on Anteros.",
      "\"I think it's time everyone knew what you're really like,\" he says.",
      "Anteros tries to think of a protest, still too angry for it to be a plea but suddenly there is a sting in his stomach.",
      "Ares is grinning at him and Anteros looks down, confused to see the war god's arm extended into his gut.",
      "It takes a slow, painful moment to register that the knife is in War's hand again.",
      "The blade has disappeared into his stomach.",
      "\"Wh-\" \"Better take you somewhere to get healed,\" Ares chuckles.",
      "Anteros doesn't understand, but their surroundings blur and rush by, changing shape.",
      "The war god vanishes, along with the knife though the wound remains.",
      "Anteros holds his bare stomach and feels the blood seep through his fingers.",
      "He knows he's on a temple floor, but his vision is red at the edges when he tries to understand which one.",
      "Anteros feels blood bubble up in his mouth as he collapses back down.",
      "It's in a shaky breath that he smells it; a narcotic compound just as his head falls against the black marble, he knows what dark, underground tunnel he is passing out in.",
      "Ares abandoned him in the Necromanteion, temple of Hades and Persephone."

    "text": "It's a few weeks after the Ides of March and Eros says the fountain is full of wine. An invitation. I follow him out into the moonlit garden without a word. Under Selene's pale glow, my brother's skin becomes a series of silver shimmers that move too quickly for my eyes to follow. I settle on the stone bench surrounding the fountain, legs tucked under me. Eros steps on to the space beside me, but goes on past until he is sinking in the fountain's wine. The rich smell spills over my senses and on to his thighs. Eros' white tunic floats up and then it's off and I can see his body stain with that dark color. Eros is watching me watch him. He grins. As if it's some new victory to see me surrender to him so easily. As if I am capable of doing anything else. I lean forward just enough for my own clothing to get damp in the fountain. Eros reaches out, his fingers grasp on the soaked fabric. Something catches in my throat. We're moving faster than usual. If this is Eros' apology for the bronze god asleep in his bed (what was once our bed), then I want to enjoy it more. I pull away before he can get a good grip. I know myself well enough, and him too. If he undresses me now, everything will be over long before all the stars appear in the sky. It will give Eros time to sneak back to Ares and I'm not letting that happen. Not tonight, when the fountain's filled with wine for us. \"How did it get here?\" I ask, dipping my hand into the tainted water. My fingertips come away sticky and I try not to notice the irritation lined in my brother's brow. He almost looks anxious. \"Dionysus. He told me to try dripping blood in here. Ichor turns sea-come to wine,\" he says with his usual laugh, \"It'll be gone by morning, though.\" Normally, the fountain is filled with ocean water- a reminder of Aphrodite's purity. She started out so clean in the sea foam, but I don't believe she's been that for a long time. Eros likes to joke about how the froth tastes like cold come. My brother lifts up a dripping white hand so I can see the new and rare scar running across his palm. Eros' blood. He lets his arm drop only to cup his hands together, raising the wine to my mouth. It's instinct more so than even desire that brings my parted lips to him. The wine splashes against the roof of my mouth and for a delicious moment Eros has the tips of his fingers in my mouth. I suck off the last drops of wine. It tastes sweeter than I'm used to, hot from his body and addictive. Eros keeps feeding it to me. Somewhere between the sixth and the seventh handful I crash into the pool with him. Eros lets the eighth drizzle on to my chest and chin. \"Does it taste good?\" he asks softly. Even if I could think of a reply, Eros doesn't give me a chance. His hand presses against my shoulder through the wet cloth, leaning me back so I float. He kisses my throat's wine-stained skin and I feel his tongue swirl, lapping up the sweet drink. Eros is sucking at my skin, too lightly to bruise but still enough for a sensuous heat to build between my legs. I try to bite back a moan, but Eros hears it anyway, probably sees it fighting my chest, and laughs. With anyone else, this would make me feel pathetic except that there is no one else. \"Your skin's so hot already,\" Eros says against my collarbone, \"Makes the wine taste even better.\" Actually, everything is warmer than usual. With soft edges that should only come with drunkenness. Even for me- even with him, this is happening too fast. Seven handfuls of wine are hardly enough to let this happen. What did Eros' blood do to me?I don't even notice his hands exploring me, separating my thighs until I am quaking under his expert touch. Eros' fingers wrap around my cock and I lose my breath. His skin is cool against mine, magnifying the sensations. Eros's fingers rubbing along the head... another moan and he squeezes his approval. My eyes close without my permission. I let him take over completely, his hands controlling me like I'm some kind of instrument. He flicks my swollen cock and I make a noise like Orpheus's golden lyre. \"Eros-,\" I whine. His touch disappears, leaving vapors of heat on my body. \"Let's go for a walk. Clear your head.\" Again with instinct over thought or will, I obey and climb out of the fountain. My tunic is soaked red, but I leave it on in the secret, sick hope that Eros will take it off for me.He walks ahead of me with his usual impish step. I limp behind, trying to calm my body down. We walk and kiss and speak softly for an hour before Eros finally stops in a drying valley. I lay on the grass and he stretches alongside me. Eros kisses my neck and his fingers slowly peel the wet cloth off my body. As I lie naked, he squeezes the wine from the tunic into my open mouth. If the alcohol had me before, I'm drunken waste now. He's kissing me when I drift off. His hands between my legs pull me back into consciousness. I hear myself moan and feel his thumb brush across my balls. Maybe not in that order. I think lips are on my cock, feel the wet heat around me, but I can't be sure and then I'm hearing voices. I hallucinate three slim figures circling us. I must be coming because my head feels even lighter and there's the sensation of air below me, around me. Feels like I could be floating on the sky. I pass out. When I wake, there are accents I don't recognize. I groan, but I'm ignored. My eyes are too heavy to open. \"He fits the description,\" a stranger rasps. \"What about the one who ran off?\" \"Why would Love have dark hair like that?\" Eros. \"This one was on his back anyway. Drunk on come, probably.\" They laugh and I think I blush but then I'm fading back into dark. The warmth of poisoned wine is replaced by an impossible chill. I try to hide from it, go back to sleep but end up shivering instead. My eyes open with some resistance.Upon looking around, I immediately regret not sinking back into dreams. I'm on a bed with only cloth, maybe crude sheets about my legs. Wherever here is, it's cold. The air is heavy with an inescapable smoke that passes though me like freezing wind trapped in my chest. I don't recognize a thing, but there's a familiarly of this situation that frightens me. There's a shiver down my back, scraping against my mind until I remember.Eros. He's abandoned me. Again. I have my guesses about where I am now. Eros makes enemies just by breathing. Maybe he amused himself with making a nymph love an ugly mortal and her river god father has me locked up in his underwater prison. Or Zeus doesn't appreciate my brother's constant harassing of Ganymede, cupbearer and whore. I suppose Zeus would know better than to give Eros a chance to slip through the cracks of a capture. It's too cold for Olympia, anyway. This place is underground, damp and smoke filled. The Underworld? My heart starts skipping because I think I am right. This is my fault, then, so maybe Eros abandoning me is fair. Choosing Thanatos for one of the three tasks was my idea. This might be Hypnos' palace. I imagine I smell an undertone of poppies through all the smoke and trying to avoid panic is becoming difficult, impossible. Something pumps blood up into my throat and I wonder if I can choke on my own heart as the door opens. It isn't Hypnos. I almost wish it were. There are certain gods that you know by looking at them. It doesn't matter that I have never seen a statue of him, nor that the only times I heard his name were in a story my mother told. Back then, I was fascinated, but Eros warned me that he is a tyrant, how he eats men's hearts whole. Hades. The hell god is not what I expect. Unlike his brothers who I have met by trailing my mother, Hades is slim with narrow shoulders. The shape of his skull is defined under ashen skin and I almost can see the sinews of individual muscles from his neck to chest. Hades has a soft expression, but it doesn't comfort me. If anyone can kill an immortal, it's Hades. This doesn't bode well for his captive and that is what I suppose I am. A prisoner with seven handfuls of Love's poison in my veins. \"You are not Eros,\" he says and it's an accusation. As if we can be blamed for not being our brothers- let alone fix it. \"Did he think he could dance his way out? Trick me by bringing his twin?\" Hades spits out the last word. We're not twins; I'm littered with flaws Love will never have, but I don't dare contradict Hades. I haven't been given permission to speak. Hades looks down, directly at me and for a moment anger flickers across his face, but it's gone and it doesn't matter because he's staring at me. I turn away and press into the headboard. Why is everything so cold here? Even the air with all that ash is making me shiver. \"Anteros.\" My body tenses hearing the hell god speak my name. \"I'm not going to hurt you, Anteros,\" his voice is gentler now, as if Hades can be soothing. I don't trust him. I keep my gaze fixed in front of me because I'm too scared to move. Out of the corner of my vision, I see he is stepping further into the little stone room. \"Look at me?\" It's a question, an invitation and I don't want to, but my eyes move anyway. Hades stands at the foot of the bed. He's wearing a scholar's robe, but it is stained black. I think he is smiling under those gaunt features, but that makes it even worse. \"I'm sorry I frightened you. Your brother... frustrates me,\" he says. I'm sorry. It is odd that Death is the first person to ever apologize to me outright? Especially when he has done nothing and Love everything. I nod. \"He frustrates most people.\" It's easy to talk about Eros, even with a hell god. I find myself relaxing in spite of Hades being so close. \"But not you,\" he clarifies. \"Not me.\" I want to ask what Eros did to warrant his attempted capture, but knowing my brother, maybe I don't have to. Maybe I don't really want to know the details. \"You don't seem surprised. Did you know he was going to do this?\" Hades asks. I shake my head. \"He's done something like this before... though he didn't try to poison me last time.\" \"You're not angry with him.\" I can hear the disgust tucked under his concern. Because of who I am and what my brother is, I've learned to detect it in people. They think I can fight him; they don't understand. \"Well, I'm not getting hurt. Why bother being angry with him?\" Hades just sighs. At least he doesn't try to argue or comprehend. Death moves on. \"Who knew Love could poison?\" he almost laughs, \"Do you need a drink?\" I hesitate. There is another story, more like gossip, I heard from Aphrodite. The garden was wilting because Hell had stolen Demeter's daughter- swallowed her whole and kept her there with seven pomegranate seeds. Hades is waiting for an answer, but I can only blurt out something thoughtless. \"The food of the dead,\" I stammer, a whisper I try desperately to call back, demand the words jump back down my throat. I expect him to be angry, but he just laughs. \"Only for pretty girls.\" Somehow, I find myself smiling. If Hades eats men's hearts, I'm safe anyway. Eros ought to know that. The poison has made my throat bone dry, so I agree to the drink and offer of clothing. Maybe not in that order. Hades is letting me stay in the Underworld until I feel better. Trouble is, I've felt alright for a while and certainly well enough to return to Eros' care. At least physically, but I don't think I can really handle seeing my brother just yet. Every time I think about him, there is the jolt of a different kind of poison -still his- that racks my body and sends my head spinning. What's the rush to return to someone who almost had me killed anyway? I should be more concerned about staying down here, I'm sure, but hell's king has been nothing but kind to me. He is soft spoken, but I can sense the power he holds without anything showy to prove it. We've fallen into the habit of walking together through the halls of a dark palace. He tells me about his brothers and the other Olympians, careful to never mention Ares unless to comment on his lack of tact. Mostly he tells me stories that my mother never bothered me with when I was younger. Sometimes we meet the heroes from the legend. Sometimes the villains. There's a lesson, I think, in being shown in person how every mortal ends up in Hades' realm. I tell him- more confess to him about what I see when I go to punish those who have the audacity to scorn love. Sometimes he knows the stories I tell him, says that the lovers still mourn here after death. He is sincere about it, about everything. All that keeps me from completely trusting him is Persephone. I see her walking the halls like a ghost. She gives me strange looks, as though I were my brother armed with those fatal arrows. Like most, she doesn't understand. I've seen something in her, though; when Spring believes no one is watching her, she follows Hades with bright green eyes. \"Is something wrong?\" I've been silent for a few minutes, listening to Hades tell me about the flower lovers. The look Hell gives me... so concerned and out of place. He must know that Hyacinth's blood red petals are worth tears. \"I've been wondering why you tried to catch Eros,\" I admit to the ceiling. There are paintings everywhere, but the most beautiful murals stretch across what would be hell's sky. This corridor is dedicated to Helios. The burnt, golden texture of the ceiling is similar to my own skin, but my eyes will never have the power or fire of the Titan's illustrated expression. I'm trying not to look at Hades. I've been worried about the answer for a while, which is ridiculous. It's not as if the hell god has given any hint to anything but loathing my brother. \"Why do you think I tried?\" Because you are a jealous lover, same as the rest of them. I avoid the question. \"When I first realized I was in the Underworld, I thought it might be Hypnos,\" I admit instead, \"Which would mean I actually deserved it. Endymion was my fault.\" \"What would you want with distracting Hypnos?\" Hades asks, he seems honestly surprised.\"I made a bet with Eros, saying that there were people out there who could never love him,\" I shrugged, \"So there were three people he had to seduce to prove me wrong. Thanatos, Aphrodite, and Ares.\" Hades only nods, but I catch a wince when I say War's name. That was my fault, too. \"I almost picked you, actually. Instead of Ares,\" I add, trying to distract myself. Hades looks me in the eye and for a moment, I can feel the pull of the Fates' strings. Spending time in the Underworld has made me wonder if we're all damned. Even the gods. \"Why didn't you?\" Maybe my subconscious knew I would be jealous when Eros succeeded. After all, even if it was true that Hades ate hearts, he was still fascinating. \"I thought one trip to the Underworld was enough.\" Hades smiles and I don't understand why. \"He came down to the Underworld anyway.\" Oh. That's why he's grinning like that. I shouldn't be surprised. With Eros' track record, I am accustomed to my brother getting everything I want. This is different, though. He called Hades a monster, why would he- \"Not for you what you think, Anteros.\" I relax a fraction, but notice we've stopped walking. I'm standing at the ivory feet of a giant statue of Apollo. \"I asked him to come, as a favor.\"I wince. Why does Hades think this is making things better? We're moving again and I'm thinking about just full out running away. I don't want to hear this. \"What for?\" I croak, to let him know I am listening, to beg him to stop talking about this. He could have just turned me down, it isn't that hard. I'm not my brother. \"I needed him to help me with Persephone. He said I was out of my league,\" Hades says. \"Oh.\" Immediately, I want to apologize, but I can't. I've never been able to undo my brother's work or what he says or else I wouldn't be like this all the time. \"He's... You didn't want to have to steal her away like that?\" \"No. But I didn't think she would love me without help. Who could love Death?\" I have an answer I'm afraid to admit. We stop again, but Hades steps a little closer and now I'm leaning against a column. I like having him near me, the unexpected warmth coming off his body. It doesn't matter that I have nowhere to go because I am suddenly certain I don't want to be anywhere else. \"She could,\" I say, but it's beginning to seem like what I say does not matter. We both know what we're really talking about. \"But you didn't give her a chance. Sometimes you don't need Love's help. Besides, all he can do is hurt her.\" \"Does it seem strange to you? Only the wounded know how to love.\" \"Eros poisons people. Even now, I can feel the venom on my lips from that wine.\" \"So if I wanted to love, I would need that poison, too?\" As always, as with everything, it's more instinct than thought when I answer him with a kiss. There's a relief that spills over me when I realize Hades is kissing me back, that his eyes are closing like that to enjoy it more. It's not about making me disappear. Strong arms pin me against the column and I don't even notice my shoulders beginning to hurt until he apologizes into my mouth. I keep kissing him, but Hades is trying to say something else. I get confident and ignore him for a moment, sucking the tongue that's trying to speak into my mouth. I lap at it and the only sound Hades can compose is a gravelly moan. I own this kiss even as I give him a moment to breathe. I start moving my lips to his cheek, his throat. \"You kiss me like that again,\" he starts, his voice is all gasps and low breaths in my ear, \"You do that again and we won't make it to the bedroom.\" I can feel the reverberations of sound in his throat as I drag my teeth against it. When I look up, Hades' eyes are rolling back with the sensation. \"Then you have a challenge on your hands,\" I say, remembering who I am for the first time in days, weeks, lifetimes. \"I never slow down.\"I'm worse than love; I'm torment. My lips are back on his and Hades' hands are roaming over my body. Warm fingers travelling over my robe, searching around my hips, resting on the small of my back. He's getting more confident, but I am not relinquishing control so easily. Arms around his neck for balance now, I wrap one and then both legs around his waist. The cloth wrapped around me droops down and exposes my legs to the underworld's lack of light. Pressed up against him like this, I can feel Death becoming as hard as I am. His breaths are getting shallow in my ear. Hades' body, once warm and comforting is now transformed to hot and strong against me. All these little movements and calculations are so fucking worth it when he finally grabs underneath me. I groan against him and then our roles are switched. His fingers are digging into my ass, a thumb tracing in circles and pressing against my entrance through the cloth. \"F-fuck,\" is all I can manage at this point. I've forgotten myself to those hands kneading into me and become something obscene. It barely even registers that he's moving us except that luxurious marble is no longer against my back. In a feeble attempt to get Hades to move faster, I try to kiss him again but my eyes are half lidded and his fingers are so close. I graze his cheek instead. Hell just smirks at me. Air rushes around us and the scenery shifts to an extravagant bedroom I have never been in before. Hades rests me on to the edge of the bed and his fingers press an increment further. I groan, but his hand moves away. He is looking down at me, admiring god knows what. Never good with patience, I shrug off my robe. I'm already breathing so hard, I didn't realize it when he was still so close to me. My heart won't slow down. Hades leans over me and I let my body slump so that I'm laying flat on the bed. He starts kissing my neck, slowly and carefully at first but as the kisses travel down my chest they become more urgent. I feel his tongue swirl around my nipple and I curse again. My arms go around him, pulling at his loose tunic until I can see his pale shoulders in the dim light. Hell starts talking to me. \"You have no idea,\" he pauses, slurping at my skin until I moan, \"how long I have wanted to do this.\" \"Nn... Do what?\" Pretending to be coy doesn't work so well when hell himself is licking up and down your body. I hold back another moan. \"Torture me?\" He's going so slowly, no one will believe in us anymore by the time he gets to my cock. My cock which is throbbing and almost painfully hard, building pressure at the head. I watch him slide his tunic all the way off. Finally. Hades' cock is longer than mine, not as thick but so hard it doesn't matter. I want him to fuck me, but I am beginning to fear he won't at this pace. Hades laughs against my stomach. His kisses change direction, so he's going back to towards my parting lips. \"Hades...,\" I try to make it sound like a complaint, but it comes out a moan. \"Touch you, kiss you,\" Hades sucks harder at my collarbone. A weak spot. I buck my hips into his, grind with a delicious speed against his cock and then it's my turn to elicit moans. \"Fuck you into the mattress if you let me.\" My turn to laugh, too. \"You think need to ask permission to fuck a sex god?\" He growls and I nearly come from the sound alone, it's so low. Like having sex with a wolf. His eyes finally are level with mine and I kiss him first, forcing my tongue inside before he has a chance to resist. Hades' mouth is hot inside, even more so than the cock pressing up against my naked thigh. He moans into my mouth when I wrap my legs around him again, pulling him closer. Hell's expression is like nothing I've ever seen before. For a moment, I remember the stories again- the ones about him eating hearts whole. His eyes are almost black now and I don't know if I have a heart to offer, but I'd give it over willingly if I do. His cock is rubbing against my entrance and my head goes back against the sheets. Hades reaches over me for a silver amphora while I kiss his neck. He smiles down at me when he has the pitcher in hand, carefully pouring oil on our legs. The scent of juniper overtakes my senses. Then he's grinding into me again. This time, I feel the head pressing against my taint. \"O-oh god.\" He's pushing in, my mouth stays open but all I can manage are shallow breaths. A few more inches, more moans. One's from him. Hades raises his hips slightly, thrusts again, and he's all the way in. I might have moaned his name, but I can't remember because he doesn't wait. He's pulling out so slowly, thrusts in sharply. Again and again, in and out. There's a fullness in this I have never know before and it feels so fucking good. My gasps turn to moans to lust-dipped sounds. Hades pushes so far inside that I can't think. The king of hell is fucking me and I'm trying to kiss him. My teeth drag along his lower lip, he shoves in further. I can't help myself. \"Harder.\" Hades swears in my ear and goes in faster, harder. Deeper. I choke on my moans. Pressure's building. His cock has gotten even harder, slick with the juniper oil, and I know he's close when he groans into another kiss. This time our tongues meet, mate, maybe they fuck, too. Hades pulls almost all the way out and then slams back into me. \"Anteros.\" I come with him; all I see are flashes of white and then a monstrous red. He's still inside me and we're both panting so hard we'll never get our breath back. Slowly, Hell pulls out and there's come leaking on to my open thighs. Hades slides down the mattress. What the hell is he- oh god. That hot tongue again, lapping against me. Almost inside, then he's there, too, cleaning up all the come. My hand flies up to my mouth, I'm biting on fingers to stop the vulgar sounds I'm making. Hades' tongue darts inside me again, goes even further. My entire body jerks forward. The sensation makes me surrender, I'm moaning louder than I ever have. He's finished too quickly, but Hades returns to my raw lips. When I kiss him, I can taste it. Sea-come. I smirk into his mouth. I don't remember falling asleep, but now I am waking up and Hades has his arm around me. I'm not accustomed to waking up with someone, not anymore. When I look up at him, I see he is already awake. Hades is regal; all sinews of elegant flesh and shaman eyes. He's smiling at me and I don't have to think before I'm smiling, too. We're always together; bathing in extravagant steam-filled rooms, talking for hours while we walk around the palace, living off of ambrosia and each other's company. I don't know how much time has passed. I'm not one to keep track of a good thing when I can just enjoy it.Hades, though, I suppose has been keeping track because there is something extremely deliberate and planned when he finally asks. \"When are you going back to your brother?\" We're lying on the canopy bed again. I'm curled into his side, but now I sit up and sigh. It makes sense, I suppose, that Hades is so aware of time. For selfish reasons, though, I wish that even Hell could forget himself once in a while. All the same, I know I owe him a reply. \"Eros will come down here looking for me eventually. Too prideful to have anyone else do it,\" I say, looking at the wrinkles in our black silk sheets, \"when he does that, I probably... will leave. But I will come back. If you let me.\" Hades shifts on the bed, behind me and out of vision. Then his arms are around my waist. I want to lean back against him, but don't. \"If you want to return, you will always be welcome.\" He's being a lot better about this than I am. I can't even reach for his hand, no matter how much I want to. We still aren't talking about everything we should. \"You say that now, Hades, and I appreciate it. but you don't know if that will really be true,\" I say, \"What if I take longer to come back than you thought I would? Take it as a rejection and are able to move on?\" \"I won't move on from this.\" He kisses my shoulder for emphasis. I shiver, but don't give in. \"You will, you can,\" I insist. Finally, I turn to look at him. Eye to sunken eye, Hell looking at me like he really does believe what he's saying. Maybe he does and I am just not ready for him to. \"I'm not the one you were so desperate to get.\" \"She hates me, Anteros. Besides, this isn't about her anyway. It's about him.\" It is about Persephone, but it's also not my place to say anything. I groan, shaking my head as I fall back into the pillows.Hades crawls over me, caging me with his arms. \"It's not about him, either.\" I sound tired, but I don't remember what that feels like anymore. \"Then what is it about?,\" Hades asks. He's being patient about this. \"You act like you hate him, but you don't.\" I close my eyes. It reminds me of talking about the lovers and the ones I go to punish. This is also a confession, but it's so much worse. \"When we were both very young, my brother stabbed me with his arrows.\" I wait, let it sink in. Hades doesn't say anything and I like not being able to read his expression, so I keep my eyes shut. \"He said that it was the only way to prove I really loved him, because me being made for him wasn't good enough. Said he was too selfish- a person just like him could never love anyone but themselves. So I let him stab me. Ever since then I have never really known if I had a choice.\" The room is still. If I didn't feel his body centimeters from my own, I would think that Hades had left. Perhaps he had finally come to his sense about this whole affair and vanished like he should have done after the first night. \"Eros shouldn't have done that to you.\" I'd almost forgotten I was talking to a hell god, but I hear it now. Hades sounds like the echoes in some wretched eternal pit, the one you're cast into for betraying those to whom you swore yourself. \"No, probably not, but I let him.\" \"Anteros.\" I open my eyes because of the admonishing tone. It doesn't suit Underworld's king. \"You don't have to go back to him at all.\" Hades moves light hair out of my eyes and smiles softly. He understands what no one has ever understood. \"I know. But can you forgive me if I do?\" He leans down and kisses me. My arms wrap around him and I get my answer with a thousand more kisses. When Love appears in the dark realm of hell, he doesn't apologize to me. He just says he was worried and wanted to make sure I wasn't being held down here against my will. I say I'm fine so he spirits me away from the Underworld before I have a chance to say good-bye. Back home, the fountain is still filled with wine, but it tastes like poison to me.",

      "Eros kisses my neck and his fingers slowly peel the wet cloth off my body.",
      "As I lie naked, he squeezes the wine from the tunic into my open mouth.",
      "If the alcohol had me before, I'm drunken waste now.",
      "He's kissing me when I drift off.",
      "His hands between my legs pull me back into consciousness.",
      "I hear myself moan and feel his thumb brush across my balls.",
      "Maybe not in that order.",
      "I think lips are on my cock, feel the wet heat around me, but I can't be sure and then I'm hearing voices.",
      "I hallucinate three slim figures circling us.",
      "I must be coming because my head feels even lighter and there's the sensation of air below me, around me.",
      "Feels like I could be floating on the sky.",
      "I pass out.",
      "When I wake, there are accents I don't recognize.",
      "I groan, but I'm ignored.",
      "My eyes are too heavy to open.",
      "\"He fits the description,\" a stranger rasps.",
      "\"What about the one who ran off?\"",
      "\"Why would Love have dark hair like that?\" Eros.",
      "\"This one was on his back anyway.",
      "Drunk on come, probably.\"",
      "They laugh and I think I blush but then I'm fading back into dark.",
      "The warmth of poisoned wine is replaced by an impossible chill.",
      "I try to hide from it, go back to sleep but end up shivering instead.",
      "My eyes open with some resistance.Upon looking around, I immediately regret not sinking back into dreams.",
      "I'm on a bed with only cloth, maybe crude sheets about my legs.",
      "Wherever here is, it's cold.",
      "The air is heavy with an inescapable smoke that passes though me like freezing wind trapped in my chest.",
      "I don't recognize a thing, but there's a familiarly of this situation that frightens me.",
      "There's a shiver down my back, scraping against my mind until I remember.Eros.",
      "He's abandoned me.",
      "Again.",
      "I have my guesses about where I am now.",
      "Eros makes enemies just by breathing.",
      "Maybe he amused himself with making a nymph love an ugly mortal and her river god father has me locked up in his underwater prison.",
      "Or Zeus doesn't appreciate my brother's constant harassing of Ganymede, cupbearer and whore.",
      "I suppose Zeus would know better than to give Eros a chance to slip through the cracks of a capture.",
      "It's too cold for Olympia, anyway.",
      "This place is underground, damp and smoke filled.",
      "The Underworld?",
      "My heart starts skipping because I think I am right.",
      "This is my fault, then, so maybe Eros abandoning me is fair.",
      "Choosing Thanatos for one of the three tasks was my idea.",
      "This might be Hypnos' palace.",
      "I imagine I smell an undertone of poppies through all the smoke and trying to avoid panic is becoming difficult, impossible.",
      "Something pumps blood up into my throat and I wonder if I can choke on my own heart as the door opens.",
      "It isn't Hypnos.",
      "I almost wish it were.",
      "There are certain gods that you know by looking at them.",
      "It doesn't matter that I have never seen a statue of him, nor that the only times I heard his name were in a story my mother told.",
      "Back then, I was fascinated, but Eros warned me that he is a tyrant, how he eats men's hearts whole.",
      "Hades.",
      "The hell god is not what I expect.",
      "Unlike his brothers who I have met by trailing my mother, Hades is slim with narrow shoulders.",
      "The shape of his skull is defined under ashen skin and I almost can see the sinews of individual muscles from his neck to chest.",
      "Hades has a soft expression, but it doesn't comfort me.",
      "If anyone can kill an immortal, it's Hades.",
      "This doesn't bode well for his captive and that is what I suppose I am.",
      "A prisoner with seven handfuls of Love's poison in my veins.",
      "\"You are not Eros,\" he says and it's an accusation.",
      "As if we can be blamed for not being our brothers- let alone fix it.",
      "\"Did he think he could dance his way out?",
      "Trick me by bringing his twin?\" Hades spits out the last word.",
      "We're not twins; I'm littered with flaws Love will never have, but I don't dare contradict Hades.",
      "I haven't been given permission to speak.",
      "Hades looks down, directly at me and for a moment anger flickers across his face, but it's gone and it doesn't matter because he's staring at me.",
      "I turn away and press into the headboard.",
      "Why is everything so cold here?",
      "Even the air with all that ash is making me shiver.",
      "\"Anteros.\"",
      "My body tenses hearing the hell god speak my name.",
      "\"I'm not going to hurt you, Anteros,\" his voice is gentler now, as if Hades can be soothing.",
      "I don't trust him.",
      "I keep my gaze fixed in front of me because I'm too scared to move.",
      "Out of the corner of my vision, I see he is stepping further into the little stone room.",
      "\"Look at me?\" It's a question, an invitation and I don't want to, but my eyes move anyway.",
      "Hades stands at the foot of the bed.",
      "He's wearing a scholar's robe, but it is stained black.",
      "I think he is smiling under those gaunt features, but that makes it even worse.",
      "\"I'm sorry I frightened you.",
      "Your brother... frustrates me,\" he says.",
      "I'm sorry.",
      "It is odd that Death is the first person to ever apologize to me outright?",
      "Especially when he has done nothing and Love everything.",
      "I nod.",
      "\"He frustrates most people.\"",
      "It's easy to talk about Eros, even with a hell god.",
      "I find myself relaxing in spite of Hades being so close.",
      "\"But not you,\" he clarifies.",
      "\"Not me.\"",
      "I want to ask what Eros did to warrant his attempted capture, but knowing my brother, maybe I don't have to.",
      "Maybe I don't really want to know the details.",
      "\"You don't seem surprised.",
      "Did you know he was going to do this?\" Hades asks.",
      "I shake my head.",
      "\"He's done something like this before... though he didn't try to poison me last time.\"",
      "\"You're not angry with him.\"",
      "I can hear the disgust tucked under his concern.",
      "Because of who I am and what my brother is, I've learned to detect it in people.",
      "They think I can fight him; they don't understand.",
      "\"Well, I'm not getting hurt.",
      "Why bother being angry with him?\" Hades just sighs.",
      "At least he doesn't try to argue or comprehend.",
      "Death moves on.",
      "\"Who knew Love could poison?\" he almost laughs, \"Do you need a drink?\" I hesitate.",
      "There is another story, more like gossip, I heard from Aphrodite.",
      "The garden was wilting because Hell had stolen Demeter's daughter- swallowed her whole and kept her there with seven pomegranate seeds.",
      "Hades is waiting for an answer, but I can only blurt out something thoughtless.",
      "\"The food of the dead,\" I stammer, a whisper I try desperately to call back, demand the words jump back down my throat.",
      "I expect him to be angry, but he just laughs.",
      "\"Only for pretty girls.\"",
      "Somehow, I find myself smiling.",
      "If Hades eats men's hearts, I'm safe anyway.",
      "Eros ought to know that.",
      "The poison has made my throat bone dry, so I agree to the drink and offer of clothing.",
      "Maybe not in that order.",
      "Hades is letting me stay in the Underworld until I feel better.",
      "Trouble is, I've felt alright for a while and certainly well enough to return to Eros' care.",
      "At least physically, but I don't think I can really handle seeing my brother just yet.",
      "Every time I think about him, there is the jolt of a different kind of poison -still his- that racks my body and sends my head spinning.",
      "What's the rush to return to someone who almost had me killed anyway?",
      "I should be more concerned about staying down here, I'm sure, but hell's king has been nothing but kind to me.",
      "He is soft spoken, but I can sense the power he holds without anything showy to prove it.",
      "We've fallen into the habit of walking together through the halls of a dark palace.",
      "He tells me about his brothers and the other Olympians, careful to never mention Ares unless to comment on his lack of tact.",
      "Mostly he tells me stories that my mother never bothered me with when I was younger.",
      "Sometimes we meet the heroes from the legend.",
      "Sometimes the villains.",
      "There's a lesson, I think, in being shown in person how every mortal ends up in Hades' realm.",
      "I tell him-",
      "more confess to him about what I see when I go to punish those who have the audacity to scorn love.",
      "Sometimes he knows the stories I tell him, says that the lovers still mourn here after death.",
      "He is sincere about it, about everything.",
      "All that keeps me from completely trusting him is Persephone.",
      "I see her walking the halls like a ghost.",
      "She gives me strange looks, as though I were my brother armed with those fatal arrows.",
      "Like most, she doesn't understand.",
      "I've seen something in her, though; when Spring believes no one is watching her, she follows Hades with bright green eyes.",
      "\"Is something wrong?\" I've been silent for a few minutes, listening to Hades tell me about the flower lovers.",
      "The look Hell gives me... so concerned and out of place.",
      "He must know that Hyacinth's blood red petals are worth tears.",
      "\"I've been wondering why you tried to catch Eros,\" I admit to the ceiling.",
      "There are paintings everywhere, but the most beautiful murals stretch across what would be hell's sky.",
      "This corridor is dedicated to Helios.",
      "The burnt, golden texture of the ceiling is similar to my own skin, but my eyes will never have the power or fire of the Titan's illustrated expression.",
      "I'm trying not to look at Hades.",
      "I've been worried about the answer for a while, which is ridiculous.",
      "It's not as if the hell god has given any hint to anything but loathing my brother.",
      "\"Why do you think I tried?\"",
      "Because you are a jealous lover, same as the rest of them.",
      "I avoid the question.",
      "\"When I first realized I was in the Underworld, I thought it might be Hypnos,\" I admit instead, \"Which would mean I actually deserved it.",
      "Endymion was my fault.\"",
      "\"What would you want with distracting Hypnos?\" Hades asks, he seems honestly surprised.\"I made a bet with Eros, saying that there were people out there who could never love him,\" I shrugged, \"So there were three people he had to seduce to prove me wrong.",
      "Thanatos, Aphrodite, and Ares.\"",
      "Hades only nods, but I catch a wince when I say War's name.",
      "That was my fault, too.",
      "\"I almost picked you, actually.",
      "Instead of Ares,\" I add, trying to distract myself.",
      "Hades looks me in the eye and for a moment, I can feel the pull of the Fates' strings.",
      "Spending time in the Underworld has made me wonder if we're all damned.",
      "Even the gods.",
      "\"Why didn't you?\"",
      "Maybe my subconscious knew I would be jealous when Eros succeeded.",
      "After all, even if it was true that Hades ate hearts, he was still fascinating.",
      "\"I thought one trip to the Underworld was enough.\"",
      "Hades smiles and I don't understand why.",
      "\"He came down to the Underworld anyway.\"",
      "Oh.",
      "That's why he's grinning like that.",
      "I shouldn't be surprised.",
      "With Eros' track record, I am accustomed to my brother getting everything I want.",
      "This is different, though.",
      "He called Hades a monster, why would he-",
      "\"Not for you what you think, Anteros.\"",
      "I relax a fraction, but notice we've stopped walking.",
      "I'm standing at the ivory feet of a giant statue of Apollo.",
      "\"I asked him to come, as a favor.\"I wince.",
      "Why does Hades think this is making things better?",
      "We're moving again and I'm thinking about just full out running away.",
      "I don't want to hear this.",
      "\"What for?\" I croak, to let him know I am listening, to beg him to stop talking about this.",
      "He could have just turned me down, it isn't that hard.",
      "I'm not my brother.",
      "\"I needed him to help me with Persephone.",
      "He said I was out of my league,\" Hades says.",
      "\"Oh.\"",
      "Immediately, I want to apologize, but I can't.",
      "I've never been able to undo my brother's work or what he says or else I wouldn't be like this all the time.",
      "\"He's...",
      "You didn't want to have to steal her away like that?\" \"No.",
      "But I didn't think she would love me without help.",
      "Who could love Death?\" I have an answer I'm afraid to admit.",
      "We stop again, but Hades steps a little closer and now I'm leaning against a column.",
      "I like having him near me, the unexpected warmth coming off his body.",
      "It doesn't matter that I have nowhere to go because I am suddenly certain I don't want to be anywhere else.",
      "\"She could,\" I say, but it's beginning to seem like what I say does not matter.",
      "We both know what we're really talking about.",
      "\"But you didn't give her a chance.",
      "Sometimes you don't need Love's help.",
      "Besides, all he can do is hurt her.\"",
      "\"Does it seem strange to you?",
      "Only the wounded know how to love.\"",
      "\"Eros poisons people.",
      "Even now, I can feel the venom on my lips from that wine.\"",
      "\"So if I wanted to love, I would need that poison, too?\"",
      "As always, as with everything, it's more instinct than thought when I answer him with a kiss.",
      "There's a relief that spills over me when I realize Hades is kissing me back, that his eyes are closing like that to enjoy it more.",
      "It's not about making me disappear.",
      "Strong arms pin me against the column and I don't even notice my shoulders beginning to hurt until he apologizes into my mouth.",
      "I keep kissing him, but Hades is trying to say something else.",
      "I get confident and ignore him for a moment, sucking the tongue that's trying to speak into my mouth.",
      "I lap at it and the only sound Hades can compose is a gravelly moan.",
      "I own this kiss even as I give him a moment to breathe.",
      "I start moving my lips to his cheek, his throat.",
      "\"You kiss me like that again,\" he starts, his voice is all gasps and low breaths in my ear, \"You do that again and we won't make it to the bedroom.\"",
      "I can feel the reverberations of sound in his throat as I drag my teeth against it.",
      "When I look up, Hades' eyes are rolling back with the sensation.",
      "\"Then you have a challenge on your hands,\" I say, remembering who I am for the first time in days, weeks, lifetimes.",
      "\"I never slow down.\"I'm worse than love; I'm torment.",
      "My lips are back on his and Hades' hands are roaming over my body.",
      "Warm fingers travelling over my robe, searching around my hips, resting on the small of my back.",
      "He's getting more confident, but I am not relinquishing control so easily.",
      "Arms around his neck for balance now, I wrap one and then both legs around his waist.",
      "The cloth wrapped around me droops down and exposes my legs to the underworld's lack of light.",
      "Pressed up against him like this, I can feel Death becoming as hard as I am.",
      "His breaths are getting shallow in my ear.",
      "Hades' body, once warm and comforting is now transformed to hot and strong against me.",
      "All these little movements and calculations are so fucking worth it when he finally grabs underneath me.",
      "I groan against him and then our roles are switched.",
      "His fingers are digging into my ass, a thumb tracing in circles and pressing against my entrance through the cloth.",
      "\"F-fuck,\" is all I can manage at this point.",
      "I've forgotten myself to those hands kneading into me and become something obscene.",
      "It barely even registers that he's moving us except that luxurious marble is no longer against my back.",
      "In a feeble attempt to get Hades to move faster, I try to kiss him again but my eyes are half lidded and his fingers are so close.",
      "I graze his cheek instead.",
      "Hell just smirks at me.",
      "Air rushes around us and the scenery shifts to an extravagant bedroom I have never been in before.",
      "Hades rests me on to the edge of the bed and his fingers press an increment further.",
      "I groan, but his hand moves away.",
      "He is looking down at me, admiring god knows what.",
      "Never good with patience, I shrug off my robe.",
      "I'm already breathing so hard, I didn't realize it when he was still so close to me.",
      "My heart won't slow down.",
      "Hades leans over me and I let my body slump so that I'm laying flat on the bed.",
      "He starts kissing my neck, slowly and carefully at first but as the kisses travel down my chest they become more urgent.",
      "I feel his tongue swirl around my nipple and I curse again.",
      "My arms go around him, pulling at his loose tunic until I can see his pale shoulders in the dim light.",
      "Hell starts talking to me.",
      "\"You have no idea,\" he pauses, slurping at my skin until I moan, \"how long I have wanted to do this.\"",
      "\"Nn... Do what?\"",
      "Pretending to be coy doesn't work so well when hell himself is licking up and down your body.",
      "I hold back another moan.",
      "\"Torture me?\"",
      "He's going so slowly, no one will believe in us anymore by the time he gets to my cock.",
      "My cock which is throbbing and almost painfully hard, building pressure at the head.",
      "I watch him slide his tunic all the way off.",
      "Finally.",
      "Hades' cock is longer than mine, not as thick but so hard it doesn't matter.",
      "I want him to fuck me, but I am beginning to fear he won't at this pace.",
      "Hades laughs against my stomach.",
      "His kisses change direction, so he's going back to towards my parting lips.",
      "\"Hades...,\" I try to make it sound like a complaint, but it comes out a moan.",
      "\"Touch you, kiss you,\" Hades sucks harder at my collarbone.",
      "A weak spot.",
      "I buck my hips into his, grind with a delicious speed against his cock and then it's my turn to elicit moans.",
      "\"Fuck you into the mattress if you let me.\"",
      "My turn to laugh, too.",
      "\"You think need to ask permission to fuck a sex god?\"",
      "He growls and I nearly come from the sound alone, it's so low.",
      "Like having sex with a wolf.",
      "His eyes finally are level with mine and I kiss him first, forcing my tongue inside before he has a chance to resist.",
      "Hades' mouth is hot inside, even more so than the cock pressing up against my naked thigh.",
      "He moans into my mouth when I wrap my legs around him again, pulling him closer.",
      "Hell's expression is like nothing I've ever seen before.",
      "For a moment, I remember the stories again- the ones about him eating hearts whole.",
      "His eyes are almost black now and I don't know if I have a heart to offer, but I'd give it over willingly if I do.",
      "His cock is rubbing against my entrance and my head goes back against the sheets.",
      "Hades reaches over me for a silver amphora while I kiss his neck.",
      "He smiles down at me when he has the pitcher in hand, carefully pouring oil on our legs.",
      "The scent of juniper overtakes my senses.",
      "Then he's grinding into me again.",
      "This time, I feel the head pressing against my taint.",
      "\"O-oh god.\"",
      "He's pushing in, my mouth stays open but all I can manage are shallow breaths.",
      "A few more inches, more moans.",
      "One's from him.",
      "Hades raises his hips slightly, thrusts again, and he's all the way in.",
      "I might have moaned his name, but I can't remember because he doesn't wait.",
      "He's pulling out so slowly, thrusts in sharply.",
      "Again and again, in and out.",
      "There's a fullness in this I have never know before and it feels so fucking good.",
      "My gasps turn to moans to lust-dipped sounds.",
      "Hades pushes so far inside that I can't think.",
      "The king of hell is fucking me and I'm trying to kiss him.",
      "My teeth drag along his lower lip, he shoves in further.",
      "I can't help myself.",
      "\"Harder.\"",
      "Hades swears in my ear and goes in faster, harder.",
      "Deeper.",
      "I choke on my moans.",
      "Pressure's building.",
      "His cock has gotten even harder, slick with the juniper oil, and I know he's close when he groans into another kiss.",
      "This time our tongues meet, mate, maybe they fuck, too.",
      "Hades pulls almost all the way out and then slams back into me.",
      "\"Anteros.\"",
      "I come with him; all I see are flashes of white and then a monstrous red.",
      "He's still inside me and we're both panting so hard we'll never get our breath back.",
      "Slowly, Hell pulls out and there's come leaking on to my open thighs.",
      "Hades slides down the mattress.",
      "What the hell is he-",
      "oh god.",
      "That hot tongue again, lapping against me.",
      "Almost inside, then he's there, too, cleaning up all the come.",
      "My hand flies up to my mouth, I'm biting on fingers to stop the vulgar sounds I'm making.",
      "Hades' tongue darts inside me again, goes even further.",
      "My entire body jerks forward.",
      "The sensation makes me surrender, I'm moaning louder than I ever have.",
      "He's finished too quickly, but Hades returns to my raw lips.",
      "When I kiss him, I can taste it.",
      "Sea-come.",
      "I smirk into his mouth.",
      "I don't remember falling asleep, but now I am waking up and Hades has his arm around me.",
      "I'm not accustomed to waking up with someone, not anymore.",
      "When I look up at him, I see he is already awake.",
      "Hades is regal; all sinews of elegant flesh and shaman eyes.",
      "He's smiling at me and I don't have to think before I'm smiling, too.",
      "We're always together; bathing in extravagant steam-filled rooms, talking for hours while we walk around the palace, living off of ambrosia and each other's company.",
      "I don't know how much time has passed.",
      "I'm not one to keep track of a good thing when I can just enjoy it.Hades, though, I suppose has been keeping track because there is something extremely deliberate and planned when he finally asks.",
      "\"When are you going back to your brother?\" We're lying on the canopy bed again.",
      "I'm curled into his side, but now I sit up and sigh.",
      "It makes sense, I suppose, that Hades is so aware of time.",
      "For selfish reasons, though, I wish that even Hell could forget himself once in a while.",
      "All the same, I know I owe him a reply.",
      "\"Eros will come down here looking for me eventually.",
      "Too prideful to have anyone else do it,\" I say, looking at the wrinkles in our black silk sheets, \"when he does that, I probably... will leave.",
      "But I will come back.",
      "If you let me.\"",
      "Hades shifts on the bed, behind me and out of vision.",
      "Then his arms are around my waist.",
      "I want to lean back against him, but don't.",
      "\"If you want to return, you will always be welcome.\"",
      "He's being a lot better about this than I am.",
      "I can't even reach for his hand, no matter how much I want to.",
      "We still aren't talking about everything we should.",
      "\"You say that now, Hades, and I appreciate it.",
      "but you don't know if that will really be true,\" I say, \"What if I take longer to come back than you thought I would?",
      "Take it as a rejection and are able to move on?\"",
      "\"I won't move on from this.\"",
      "He kisses my shoulder for emphasis.",
      "I shiver, but don't give in.",
      "\"You will, you can,\" I insist.",
      "Finally, I turn to look at him.",
      "Eye to sunken eye, Hell looking at me like he really does believe what he's saying.",
      "Maybe he does and I am just not ready for him to.",
      "\"I'm not the one you were so desperate to get.\"",
      "\"She hates me, Anteros.",
      "Besides, this isn't about her anyway.",

    "text": "\"Not anyone,\" Anteros argues with a light swat from his golden club to his forehead. Eros looks up at his brother lounging on the chaise. \"Yes, anyone,\" he says in an almost serious manner. They've been play-fighting for a while now, which has since fallen to simply play-arguing. Eros extends his hand and pushes the tip of the club back up on to the cushions and Anteros' wrist follows farther, landing on his hip. \"Eros, come off it. You can't seduce anyone. Believe me, I know. Beauty's not enough all the time,\" his brother argues, \"Remember my name. What it means. \" He rolls his eyes. With a strategic and graceful push, Eros slides up from the marble floor and stands, staring down at fair-haired Anteros. \"Yeah? You remember mine. There isn't a single person out there who can resist Love.\" \"Want to bet?\" \"Sure.\" # The deal is on very simple terms; Eros gets bragging rights or Anteros doesn't get blamed when-if his brother's head gets lopped off. The complications are in the list of three people Anteros chose; each one has to give themselves to him willingly. First was Thanatos who is dead to everything and needs no companion but his sleeping twin. He'd been no challenge and it was almost an irritation to spend time construing the plan. Eros knows all about siblings, his mother never shuts her legs to anyone, so he knows the way to get to Death is to distract Sleep. Hypnos mesmerized by the beauty of some shepherd named Endymion left Thanatos bored and horny. Eros had barely appeared in the bedroom and the first task was already almost over. Little to no effort. Second was Aphrodite, something Anteros expected his brother to have an issue with. Eros was more concerned with Love not needing Love, so he disguised himself in his father's skin. It was trickier, because of the acting and lying involved, but still easy enough. Then the last one. Anteros claims that it's to balance everything out; two for love, two for death. Third is Ares. Getting out of Tartarus is easier than sneaking into the palace of Ares, so Eros chooses something public. War is a spectacle anyway; this is what he figures at least now that he's looking around at the statues in the temple. Eros' plan only goes as far as finding Ares. He knows he doesn't need to do anything else. Unlike the first two consorts, Ares will see the shard of beauty Eros is and be cut by it. Simple. The fall of his leather sandals on the marble are the only sounds in the temple. The few priests saw him come in and dipped their heads. They know because they're smart- smart enough to bow to one of the rare gods actually capable of giving a man power. Eros is glad he doesn't have any temples; it'd be embarrassing to have one and let it be this bare. There are statues depicting the god with different weapons and the walls display a story of him founding Thebes. Eros has never bothered to found anything. It's bad enough he's shooting mortals on a daily basis; he doesn't need to watch a whole city of them, too. At the end of the hall there is a black throne. Personally, Eros thinks the decadence of it suits an actual king better- possibly Hades. He flutters right up the steps and falls sideways across the throne, treating it like a chaise back home. Eros already decided that Ares is interested in spectacles, so he's decided to become one. Lazily, he traces his fingers down his chest, brushes against his leg where the cloth of his tunic has fallen down to expose skin. Eros holds himself and eyes one of the statues closest to him. Ares leaning against his spear wearing nothing but a helmet and dark expression. None of the poems ever mention that War is beautiful, perhaps because of the connotation, but he is. The way he stands, he looks like a panther with his sharp jaw and a man with the anger in his eyes and sexless with that flat torso- all of those things all at once. It makes Eros want to tear him apart. He starts to trace himself, pulls at his cock and imagines that statue under him, soft and malleable for him and only him. Eros moans, for himself and for Stone Ares and rocks his hips just enough to thrust a little more into his hand. He's so fucking close already- it's been a while since Eros has tried this himself and his fingers have an expert gift. The image of the god moaning below him, writhing for him makes him all the harder. Eros teases himself, slowing down and making his touches butterfly light. Cool air hits him and he adjusts, shrugging his shoulders until his tunic falls open and off below him. Now naked and on display, white cloth and skin on the garish black throne. Eros closes his eyes and imagines the statue made of flesh, helmet gone and that hot, wet mouth- he bucks his hips- right on him, around him and he takes it, fucks it. Eros is there, but he doesn't let himself come. He bites his lip a little, drags his teeth down on his skin in an euphoric rhythm and he's sofuckinclo- \"What the hell are you doing?\" Eros relaxes and opens his eyes. He's still impossibly hard, but his hands fly up to rest behind his head. He can smell the sweat on himself, the hot semen that leaked out on to his fingertips. Ares stares down at him, broad shouldered and bronze like armor even in just his skin and the cloth around his hips. Love only smiles up at his angry glare, ignoring the big hand resting on a real spear. \"Making an offering.\" Ares' face is suddenly tinted scarlet and Eros smirks up at his handy work. His is cock aching now, but he's acting comfortable. Blonde hair sticks to his neck and he knows he looks inviting. Cool air washes over Eros and he bites back a moan at the teasing sensation against his swollen, sensitive skin. \"Isn't that what you do in temples? Make offerings to gods? Would you like to make one?\" Eros asks sweetly and he gestures towards the heat rising between his legs. The war god is not amused, but Eros catches his eyes flicker over to his cock anyway. He doesn't miss the shift in the Olympian's posture, adjusting to conceal something uncomfortable- sore. Eros moves as well and now he's sitting contentedly in Ares' throne, his legs spread wide enough for him to be still open. It also means Ares has to consciously resist allowing his gaze to travel further down from Eros' face. \"Explain why you think you're entitled to defacing my temple,\" he orders. Ares is a war general, but it doesn't seem to compute that Eros is no solider. If anything, he's a thief. Stealing men's dignity without them so much as missing it. Eros is considering which direction he should move his hips when he finally gets off of the throne, but for now he's letting Ares get a nice view. He rests his arms behind him and leans back, letting his palms support him and putting himself further on display. \"I'm not defacing it,\" he argues and spreads his legs a little more. \"Can you really think of a better offering than ambrosia?\" Ares' eyes tighten into a very handsome glare and the sweet tip of his spear is suddenly pressing against Love's throat. \"Don't think I won't, Eros. I will if I have to. Stop playing games; tell me what you're doing here.\" Eros knows, though, that Ares wants to cut him, so he leans forward and a bit if blood spouts up, a richer color than anything in the whole temple. Eros barely even winces, instead he opens his lips just enough for a moan to spill out as red stains the spear and glides down his chest in bright coppery rivulets. Blood doesn't smell that different from semen and it feels just as hot on his skin. \"You- what-,\" is all he stammers, unintelligible, but Eros still smiles. Ares pulls the spear back, disgusted, horrified, utterly pissed off, and now unable to conceal the faintest shape of a hardon. The blood glides over the god's fingers. He's so tan that the red almost looks like mud. \"Guess you'll have to settle for my blood instead.\" Eros doesn't give Ares a chance to get angry again. He shifts up a little, balancing on just one arm now. His chest touches the war god's, who stands stunned like his statues. Blood smears on both their bodies as Eros reaches up to try and wrap his arm around Ares' shoulder, but he's pushed back with a sudden force. Love feels pain this time. His skull hits the back of the throne when he's thrown against it. Ares isn't don't yet, so it's followed by a rough smack and the blunt end of the spear ramming into his collarbone. Eros bites his lip and his cock just gets impossibly harder and it's irritating the hell out of Ares. The war god shifts his posture and Love glances down at his attacker's legs, unabashed and knowing. When he notices, Ares grunts at him and the spear digs in. Eros looks right back at him and ignores the searing pain coming from his shoulder. \"If you wanted to really hurt me,\" Eros begins in an almost sneer, but he can't conceal pain and his voice has an oracle's rasp, \"If you wanted to really hurt me, you'd have stabbed me by now. Destroyed me with those fists. Beat me 'till I bled. You don't want to hurt Love, you can't.\" Ares roars this time, loud enough for Eros to wince, and forces the spear further. It's going to leave a scar, it's going to draw blood, crush bones and lungs.\"Not letting you get away with dying easy, Eros.\" Love just moans and reaches out again. Feebly, his arm latches on to the one holding the spear. Ares has a gold band on his forearm and Eros latches his fingers under it and the god lets go at the unfamiliar touch. No one caresses War- no one's that crazy. The spear clatters onto the marble, just barely missing Eros' leg on the way down. \"I can read you, Ares,\" he says softly, \"You see?\" Eros' wound has closed up and scarred, and even though his shoulder feels like it's been crushed, he pushes forward until his arm is around Ares' neck. It fucking hurts but he does it anyway- to get a reaction. \"Let go.\" Same war general orders, Eros ignores him and instead pulls his neck and head forward, using the god's breaths as increments of distance. Skin moving against skin is enough for Ares. Every time Eros' fingertips brush against him, a muscle in War's throat jumps up and he moves a little, trying to get away from it. \"Let go, Eros.\" He does, but not because he's told to. With Ares watching, Love brings his hand back down to his cock and relaxes into the throne again. He barely brushes it, but then Ares is trying to avert his eyes. And failing. Eros isn't going to hold out very long, but he doesn't know any other way to speed things up. He throws his head back, but his eyes are still fixed on Ares. \"Want your offering?\" he asks in between two soft moans. He stops, his hand just holding his cock now. \"Come, Ares, sit on your throne,\" Eros invites. \"You're a sick bastard.\" Ares takes a step back, but Eros is quick. His leg reaches out and latches around Ares' waist, pulling him back again. \"Not as bad as you.\" Eros takes advantage of his position, which Ares is too astounded to get out of, and pulls forward more until the war god almost loses his balance. Ares sways, but while he's waving his arms out, he's sneaks a punch right across Love's face. Eros lets go, whimpering a little because he doesn't think quick enough to gasp. He isn't given another chance either, because Ares grabs him by the hair and pulls him up. \"Get out of my temple, Eros. You're fucking lucky I don't have time to torture you correctly,\" Ares spits right into his pretty face and then the war god throws him into the statue from before. Eros sees the firm line of his stone jaw just before he blacks out. # He refuses to lose. Love conquers all; it's a war. Everyone knows that. He just needs a better strategy. Anteros tells him he's being stupid, that the bet's been won already. He doesn't get it. The point is no one rejects Love. Ever. Eros is stretched back on his canopy bed and mulling over possibilities. He knows disguising himself won't work with Ares -too clever with his scheming blood thirsty mind- and more than that, Eros doesn't want to have to conceal himself to win him over. After an hour or so of deliberating and throwing ideas back on to silk sheets, Eros resolves to prove himself to fastidious Ares. He knows he's already worthy, it only will take words now, for once Love will not speak simply sweet nothings. # Ares arrives at Aphrodite's palace under the misguided belief that Eros is capable of feeling rejection, especially on these terms. In actuality, it's a bit flattering. Everyone always tells him that he has his mother's good looks and though he's inclined to disagree because everything is his own, Eros is willing to entertain the belief for now. So when Ares comes trudging in thinking that fucking his mother is going to upset Eros, the god instead takes it to mean that he sought out the next best thing. Eros goes wandering through the halls with his brother flitting by his side and together they happen upon the couple tangled together in the foyer. Aphrodite's white, exposed back being clawed at as only as war god knows how to and Ares thrusting as hard as he can into her. Anteros, hand flying to half shield his eyes, seems more startled than Eros, who only smiles at Ares. If he is trying to be defiant or prove something, he probably shouldn't come right when he sees Eros, the way he is doing now. Ares moans just looking at him, that's all he needs (or so Eros decides). Love wraps an arm around his brother's shoulders and they walk across the room without a word. The only sound in the palace is their mother's soft moans and the slap of skin against skin when they escape the garden. # \"You're not upset?\" Eros shrugs. He's perched in the tallest tree, draped in orchids and with a view of the sea on the top branch. Anteros is looking up at him from a collection of boulders. His brother has lighter skin than him, but here stretched out on the soft bed of moss that has layered over the rocks he almost glows. If Eros squints, he looks more like an idol made of gold shining in the sunlight than a living thing. \"I take it as a compliment. He came out here because he's had a hardon since the day at the temple and he would risk another encounter - or who knows, maybe he wants one- just to get rid of the hot fantasies he's had since then. Meaning he's had them,\" Eros says, all proud of himself. He ignores the skeptical look his brother is giving him. \"At the very least, he felt the need to do something, to prove something.\" \"Yeah, that he's rejecting you,\" Anteros says and shakes his head. Eros climbs down from the tree, careful not to crush the flowers. This garden is a present from Demeter. Everything is has a subtle decadence to it, from the swelling, phallic flowers to the shape of each mound of moss or white crush of water as it strokes the shore. It's perfect in every way for a sex goddess and the best part is the tree, which Eros now leans against. An orchid rests against his cheek and he turns, eyes closed, kissing and then lapping at it. He gets sweet pollen on his tongue and moves to a new flower, sucking on the engorged pistil. \"How could he possibly reject,\" Eros stops to dive his tongue into the center of the flower, \"me? He's only resisting.\" He doesn't realize Anteros has moved off of the rocks until his brother's fingertips rest against his collarbone. Eros does not open his eyes because he trusts him. He just leans back, lips still parted for an orchid. \"I don't know how anyone could,\" Anteros says and his tongue replaces the flower. # Eros knows that Ares can't resist him for very long, especially when he comes back. Neither brother understood then that War intended to make a habit of visiting Aphrodite. The goddess herself likely did not realize it until the fourth time in a month. That was two months ago, during which time Anteros has gotten increasingly more aggressive. Still not enough for Eros, who has taken to craving blood and never getting it. Ares is never around for him, never alone though he often spends the night at their palace. Two months of this dissatisfaction, now it's the Ides of March and it's funny because it's also time for Aphrodite to get bored. Which she does. \"Oh, Eros, he's so awful. Always the same thing; just shoves it in, take what he wants. Awful,\" she sighs to her son, who rests on the chaise with his head in her lap. She idly plays with his hair, almost loving but also cautious. She's always like this; worried she might shatter her gorgeous sons because it's true that love can cut and beauty will kill. \"Are you done with him?\" Eros has been waiting for this to happen and it's a bit difficult to keep from smiling- Aphrodite hasn't figured anything out yet and Ares isn't going to tell her. Out of shame, likely. Eros has yet to lose his confidence. He hasn't told her about the day at the temple yet for this reason, too; he doesn't want any help. \"Hnn, no. Never done, but done for a while. I'm going out- considering the date, I think it's a nice touch to be gone.\" Aphrodite has done this before with other lovers, so Eros is hardly surprised. \"It's a shame, you know. He used to be very interesting; first three or so times. Mostly before you or Anteros were even born. Maybe once a while after, never since.\" # When Ares arrives that day, the palace only offers the sons of its queen holding each other in the garden. Anteros sees War first and tenses with a jealousy Eros recognizes enough to look behind him. Ares is standing at the entrance in his leather armor, glaring at the two of them. Because Eros knows what makes the god envious now, he looks back at his brother and kisses him carefully until Anteros is moaning under his lips. Ares turns red and that same muscle from the day in the temple leaps up in his throat. His skin glistens with the movement and Eros has to consciously make an effort to keep his attention on his brother. Aphrodite is still gone during the night, but Ares stays in her bed anyway. Expecting. Instead, it's Eros who sneaks into the room around midnight. The taste of Anteros still lingers on his lips- not salty like he should be, but sweet and fresh and untouched even though Eros knows that he's not. Eros licks his lips and creeps up to the bed, where the god is asleep. He's naked, which makes this easier. Nothing shifts when Love, feather light as always, climbs on to the sheets. Ares is still asleep when Eros tenderly inches above him. Looking down at him now, Eros remembers the beauty he saw in that statue from before. In person, the feline qualities- predatory but graceful are only more refined. Though he wouldn't call it easy, Eros could just take him right now, but that would defeat the whole purpose. He wants Ares to give himself up, wants him to want it, too. Eros starts with his tongue, kissing Ares' thighs while he sleeps as he tests the water. No reaction, just a light change in the breathing. Eros licks at the smooth skin and moves on until his mouth finds Ares' cock in the moonlight. The god under him makes a sound, some kind of whine-moan hybrid that Eros never expected. It makes him just as hard as he's about to make Ares. He opens up his mouth and takes as much of his cock as he can get, pulling at it with his mouth and tongue. He slurps at it carefully, sucks lightly and then hums around it. Eros can feel the heat start to build and it firms up. By the time Ares starts to stir, Eros is only using his hands, but his cock is wet and slick already. He's kneeling between Ares legs when the war god opens his eyes. \"Fuck! Erosgetoff.\" Eros laughs. \"Only the first one, sorry,\" he says and picks up rhythm. Ares has a big cock, something Eros almost laments now. His pride won't let him give in, though. Ares can fuck him later, but right now everything is going too well as War moans for him. \"Oh g-god,\" Ares tries to bite his lip, but because of who he is, that only makes his cock stiffer. Eros flicks at the head with an index finger and leans down a bit. \"Yeah?,\" he asks with a laugh, and then kisses Ares' swollen cock lightly. He twists his wrist a bit and precum slicks his fingertips. Ares bucks his hips into Love's hand. \"More.\" Triumph. Eros lets go, grinning as Ares growls. \"What the hell? I said more, don't stop. Fucking whore, get back to work.\" Eros rolls his eyes. \"I'm not my mother. You want me? Fine. Lift up your hips for me.\" Ares gives him the stupidest, most confused look Eros has ever seen. Even virgins usually get it within the first five seconds. Eros sighs and starts stroking his own cock, which is already hard from listening to the sounds Ares made. It's when War is staring, salivating at Eros' cock that he gets it. \"No fucking way.\" \"It's the only fucking way.\" Eros, because he's a damn good tease, leans down and breathes on Ares' cock. The war god chokes out a moan. \"Eros...\" Love moves his hands to knead at Ares' inner thighs. War isn't putting up much of a fight, only with words and an angry grunt as Eros' hands move back on to his ass. \"Come on, Ares; just give it to me already.\" Fingers find his entrance and Ares does move up a little. The action is almost surrender, but hardly enough. Eros makes circles around hot flesh a few times and then finally goes in. He's tight, tighter than Eros could have fantasized. Ares grunts and adjusts. Eros goes in slowly, then out fast, in slowly again with another finger. War groans under him. Eros rewards him by lapping at his cock again. \"Fuck, Eros, fuck... you fucking whore.\" \"I don't appreciate the 'whore' comments,\" Eros says and his fingers disappear. Ares all but whimpers for their presence. \"Bloodlust isn't far from actual lust, Ares. I deserve more respect.\" Love turns his attention back to his own cock and leans over Ares, reaching for oil that had been meant for Aphrodite. He slicks himself with it and splashes the remainder on to Ares' thighs. \"Keep going, keep going-please. I'm sorry, you're right.\" Eros considers playfully asking Ares to castrate himself along with this apology, but that would be such a pity. \"I don't think you mean it,\" he says, his voice more throat than air now. Eros strokes at his own cock, making a soft mming noise as he feels the oil spread. \"If want a whore, you can go hire one. Or wait for mother.\" \"Pl-please. God, Eros, please keep going. You're not a whore, you're a god.\" Hm, original enough. Eros rewards him with three rough fingers and a kiss on his thigh. His fingers slide back in easily and this time Ares lifts up his hips for him. Eros doesn't even need to stretch him anymore, now it's just to get the oil inside and watch Ares squirm a little more. The war god writhes and when Eros nips at his chest, he moans loud enough for Love to feel the reverberation. Eros slowly pulls out his fingers and moves up, adjusting. He rubs his cock against Ares until there's oil lathered on everything. Ares whines a little and that's almost enough for Eros to come right then and there, but he doesn't. He shuts him up by putting those fingers in his mouth and doesn't even have to order Ares to suck before the god's lapping at them with a wet, inviting tongue. He leans in close, hands on either side of Ares' head and kisses his ear, sucking at the lobe. \"Beg me for it, Ares,\" he orders, adapting the war general tone from so long ago and pulls his fingers out of his mouth. He drags his teeth expertly across skin and licks his cheek with a lewd grin when Ares moans. \"Don't just make noises, beg me.\" Eros glides his fingertips across Ares' hot skin, creating trails of saliva down his chest, circling nipples without touching them. \"Pl-please, fuc-\" Eros almost lets the hot tip slip inside, but he pulls back again. Ares wets his lips and tries again.\"Please, fuck. Eros. Fuck me. Take me.\" \"I don't think you deserve it, lying to me all this time,\" he says, even as he grinds roughly against him. Ares groans, his eyes roll back in pleasure. \"I- I- I only came here to see you. Always imagined she was you,\" Ares stammers, \"Take me, please. You can use me, I don't care. please.\" \"Why should I?\" He slurps up more of Ares' ear and then lets his wet kisses travel down to his collarbone. \"Nggh god... B-because. Because I want you, please Eros, I want you so much,\" Ares babbles helplessly between wet moans. \"I've wanted you since I saw you... ngh, in the temple. Fuck me.\" So Eros does. He thrusts in as hard as he can and Ares roars in pleasure. There's the slap of them coming together, of Eros fucking him, but mostly it's Ares. He keeps talking, but the majority of it is incoherent except for Eros, Eros, Eros which becomes a raspy, chanted moan with each thrust of hips into hips. Eros pushes in as far as he can go and kisses Ares until War is sucking on his tongue. He pulls almost all the way out, only to slam back in which elicits a cry from the god moaning for him, around him. Heat flows off of them and into each other. Ares wraps his legs around Eros' waist, trying to get more of him inside. Any kind of dignity the god had is lost in the moans. Eros is reaching his limit just as Ares reaches for his own cock, jerking himself off. They don't have to say a thing- Eros thrusts in one more time, harder than ever and Ares cries out and they come together. Hot semen gets all over Ares' stomach and chest, even a little on Eros. With Love still inside him, Ares gingerly licks at the salty fluid on Eros' cheek. He slowly pulls out, gasping softly as some of the come spills out onto the cool sheets. Eros rests against Ares and they fall asleep with vines of orchids growing on the ceiling above them.",

      "Ares turns red and that same muscle from the day in the temple leaps up in his throat.",
      "His skin glistens with the movement and Eros has to consciously make an effort to keep his attention on his brother.",
      "Aphrodite is still gone during the night, but Ares stays in her bed anyway.",
      "Expecting.",
      "Instead, it's Eros who sneaks into the room around midnight.",
      "The taste of Anteros still lingers on his lips- not salty like he should be, but sweet and fresh and untouched even though Eros knows that he's not.",
      "Eros licks his lips and creeps up to the bed, where the god is asleep.",
      "He's naked, which makes this easier.",
      "Nothing shifts when Love, feather light as always, climbs on to the sheets.",
      "Ares is still asleep when Eros tenderly inches above him.",
      "Looking down at him now, Eros remembers the beauty he saw in that statue from before.",
      "In person, the feline qualities- predatory but graceful are only more refined.",
      "Though he wouldn't call it easy, Eros could just take him right now, but that would defeat the whole purpose.",
      "He wants Ares to give himself up, wants him to want it, too.",
      "Eros starts with his tongue, kissing Ares' thighs while he sleeps as he tests the water.",
      "No reaction, just a light change in the breathing.",
      "Eros licks at the smooth skin and moves on until his mouth finds Ares' cock in the moonlight.",
      "The god under him makes a sound, some kind of whine-moan hybrid that Eros never expected.",
      "It makes him just as hard as he's about to make Ares.",
      "He opens up his mouth and takes as much of his cock as he can get, pulling at it with his mouth and tongue.",
      "He slurps at it carefully, sucks lightly and then hums around it.",
      "Eros can feel the heat start to build and it firms up.",
      "By the time Ares starts to stir, Eros is only using his hands, but his cock is wet and slick already.",
      "He's kneeling between Ares legs when the war god opens his eyes.",
      "\"Fuck!",
      "Erosgetoff.\"",
      "Eros laughs.",
      "\"Only the first one, sorry,\" he says and picks up rhythm.",
      "Ares has a big cock, something Eros almost laments now.",
      "His pride won't let him give in, though.",
      "Ares can fuck him later, but right now everything is going too well as War moans for him.",
      "\"Oh g-god,\" Ares tries to bite his lip, but because of who he is, that only makes his cock stiffer.",
      "Eros flicks at the head with an index finger and leans down a bit.",
      "\"Yeah?,\" he asks with a laugh, and then kisses Ares' swollen cock lightly.",
      "He twists his wrist a bit and precum slicks his fingertips.",
      "Ares bucks his hips into Love's hand.",
      "\"More.\"",
      "Triumph.",
      "Eros lets go, grinning as Ares growls.",
      "\"What the hell?",
      "I said more, don't stop.",
      "Fucking whore, get back to work.\"",
      "Eros rolls his eyes.",
      "\"I'm not my mother.",
      "You want me? Fine.",
      "Lift up your hips for me.\"",
      "Ares gives him the stupidest, most confused look Eros has ever seen.",
      "Even virgins usually get it within the first five seconds.",
      "Eros sighs and starts stroking his own cock, which is already hard from listening to the sounds Ares made.",
      "It's when War is staring, salivating at Eros' cock that he gets it.",
      "\"No fucking way.\"",
      "\"It's the only fucking way.\"",
      "Eros, because he's a damn good tease, leans down and breathes on Ares' cock.",
      "The war god chokes out a moan.",
      "\"Eros...\" Love moves his hands to knead at Ares' inner thighs.",
      "War isn't putting up much of a fight, only with words and an angry grunt as Eros' hands move back on to his ass.",
      "\"Come on, Ares; just give it to me already.\"",
      "Fingers find his entrance and Ares does move up a little.",
      "The action is almost surrender, but hardly enough.",
      "Eros makes circles around hot flesh a few times and then finally goes in.",
      "He's tight, tighter than Eros could have fantasized.",
      "Ares grunts and adjusts.",
      "Eros goes in slowly, then out fast, in slowly again with another finger.",
      "War groans under him.",
      "Eros rewards him by lapping at his cock again.",
      "\"Fuck, Eros, fuck...",
      "you fucking whore.\"",
      "\"I don't appreciate the 'whore' comments,\" Eros says and his fingers disappear.",
      "Ares all but whimpers for their presence.",
      "\"Bloodlust isn't far from actual lust, Ares.",
      "I deserve more respect.\"",
      "Love turns his attention back to his own cock and leans over Ares, reaching for oil that had been meant for Aphrodite.",
      "He slicks himself with it and splashes the remainder on to Ares' thighs.",
      "\"Keep going, keep going-please.",
      "I'm sorry, you're right.\"",
      "Eros considers playfully asking Ares to castrate himself along with this apology, but that would be such a pity.",
      "\"I don't think you mean it,\" he says, his voice more throat than air now.",
      "Eros strokes at his own cock, making a soft mming noise as he feels the oil spread.",
      "\"If want a whore, you can go hire one.",
      "Or wait for mother.\"",
      "\"Pl-please.",
      "God, Eros, please keep going.",
      "You're not a whore, you're a god.\"",
      "Hm, original enough.",
      "Eros rewards him with three rough fingers and a kiss on his thigh.",
      "His fingers slide back in easily and this time Ares lifts up his hips for him.",
      "Eros doesn't even need to stretch him anymore, now it's just to get the oil inside and watch Ares squirm a little more.",
      "The war god writhes and when Eros nips at his chest, he moans loud enough for Love to feel the reverberation.",
      "Eros slowly pulls out his fingers and moves up, adjusting.",
      "He rubs his cock against Ares until there's oil lathered on everything.",
      "Ares whines a little and that's almost enough for Eros to come right then and there, but he doesn't.",
      "He shuts him up by putting those fingers in his mouth and doesn't even have to order Ares to suck before the god's lapping at them with a wet, inviting tongue.",
      "He leans in close, hands on either side of Ares' head and kisses his ear, sucking at the lobe.",
      "\"Beg me for it, Ares,\" he orders, adapting the war general tone from so long ago and pulls his fingers out of his mouth.",
      "He drags his teeth expertly across skin and licks his cheek with a lewd grin when Ares moans.",
      "\"Don't just make noises, beg me.\"",
      "Eros glides his fingertips across Ares' hot skin, creating trails of saliva down his chest, circling nipples without touching them.",
      "\"Pl-please, fuc-\" Eros almost lets the hot tip slip inside, but he pulls back again.",
      "Ares wets his lips and tries again.\"Please, fuck.",
      "Eros.",
      "Fuck me.",
      "Take me.\"",
      "\"I don't think you deserve it, lying to me all this time,\" he says, even as he grinds roughly against him.",
      "Ares groans, his eyes roll back in pleasure.",
      "\"I- I- I only came here to see you.",
      "Always imagined she was you,\" Ares stammers, \"Take me, please.",
      "You can use me, I don't care.",
      "please.\"",
      "\"Why should I?\"",
      "He slurps up more of Ares' ear and then lets his wet kisses travel down to his collarbone.",
      "\"Nggh god... B-because.",
      "Because I want you, please Eros, I want you so much,\" Ares babbles helplessly between wet moans.",
      "\"I've wanted you since I saw you... ngh, in the temple.",
      "Fuck me.\"",
      "So Eros does.",
      "He thrusts in as hard as he can and Ares roars in pleasure.",
      "There's the slap of them coming together, of Eros fucking him, but mostly it's Ares.",
      "He keeps talking, but the majority of it is incoherent except for Eros, Eros, Eros which becomes a raspy, chanted moan with each thrust of hips into hips.",
      "Eros pushes in as far as he can go and kisses Ares until War is sucking on his tongue.",
      "He pulls almost all the way out, only to slam back in which elicits a cry from the god moaning for him, around him.",
      "Heat flows off of them and into each other.",
      "Ares wraps his legs around Eros' waist, trying to get more of him inside.",
      "Any kind of dignity the god had is lost in the moans.",
      "Eros is reaching his limit just as Ares reaches for his own cock, jerking himself off.",
      "They don't have to say a thing- Eros thrusts in one more time, harder than ever and Ares cries out and they come together.",
      "Hot semen gets all over Ares' stomach and chest, even a little on Eros.",
      "With Love still inside him, Ares gingerly licks at the salty fluid on Eros' cheek.",
      "He slowly pulls out, gasping softly as some of the come spills out onto the cool sheets.",
      "Eros rests against Ares and they fall asleep with vines of orchids growing on the ceiling above them."

    "text": "Once, the fields were replanted as soon as their bounty was harvested, the boughs of trees always hung heavy with flowers and fruit, and spring and autumn existed always in the same instant. In those days, men took for granted the grace of lady Demeter, but she had no concerns as long as her daughter was with her. When suitors came to pledge their love to the beautiful young goddess, Demeter turned them away, and admitted only the other maiden Olympians to her daughter's company. Persephone was not content remain forever hidden from the world, no matter what her beloved mother's plans were. So after Demeter sent Apollo away, the maiden stole away from her nymphs and went to him as he stood in a bright meadow. The sun god, beautiful even among the peerless Olympians, radiated his pleasure upon seeing her. She smiled at his praises and his smug confidence, and pressed a gentle hand against his chest when he swooped in to claim her lips for his own. \"I have three questions for you, shining Apollo, before I am yours. If I am to defy my mother, I wish to be certain of my choice.\" He laughed. \"Ask them, then. You will not be disappointed.\" \"What color is my hair?\" The sun god wrapped a lock of her long, long hair around a finger, raised it to his lips and kissed it. \"Your hair is the color of the sky at sunset, with the glorious luminance of the sun as it descends into the western sea.\" Persephone only smiled. \"What would I be to you, my lord? What position would I hold in your heart?\" The god of music placed one hand on her waist and a hand against her cheek, leaning in to whisper into her ear, \"You would be my lover, my mistress, my muse. I would compose songs to your beauty and make love to you on a bed of clouds.\" Persephone sighed in pleasure. \"And what, my lord, is my function as a goddess?\" The god of youth moved his hand from her waist to her belly, pressing hard and sliding downwards. \"You are spring, my flower, you are birth and youth and nature.\" Still smiling, Persephone twisted out of Apollo's grasp, her voice filled with poisonous sweetness. \"You are eloquent, it is true, and beautiful. But you see only your own glory reflected in me, my lord. If you love yourself so dearly, I would advise finding yourself a mirror, or perhaps a twin?\" She raised her eyebrows and smiled at his slowly growing fury. \"You think of me as the maiden goddess of birth and youth, yet that is clearly your sister's role. I have heard of your jealousies, of how you murdered Orion, the only man who stirred her to reject her chastity. You would not marry me, because it is Artemis you desire. Be on your way, little brother, I will not be second to any woman in my lover's heart.\" She bounded away, laughing merrily at his shouts, her only pursuers. Next came Hermes, the forever-traveling messenger of the gods. Though he was fleet of foot, she caught him in a wooded grove, stripped nude and kneeling by a pool to drink. He approached her with more deference than Apollo, but there was a light of conquest in his eyes and hunger in his smile. She lowered her lashes and smiled demurely at him. \"I have three questions for you, cunning Hermes, before I am yours. If I am to defy my mother, I wish to be certain of my choice.\" He lounged back on the grass, unconcerned. \"If it is a test of my wits, my lady Kore, you will not find me lacking.\" His smile widened. \"Nor in other areas, unlike my girlish brother Apollo.\" Persephone giggled into her hand and blushed. \"My lord, what color is my hair?\" \"I am no poet, my lady, but to me, your hair is the color of copper veins in the earth, of warm red clay.\" The god of athleticism stretched his arms and arched his back as he spoke, letting the dappled sunlight play over well-sculpted muscles. Persephone averted her eyes but stole an admiring glance every now and again. \"What would I be to you, my lord? What position would I hold in your heart?\" \"You would be my wife, for no other position would suit a daughter of Zeus and Demeter. You would keep my home and be there to welcome me when I return from my duties, to rub my feet and ease my aching heart, and I would see that you were well taken care of.\" The god of commerce and protection smiled and rose to his feet, pacing in circles around her, eyes tracking possessively over her curves. Persephone caught her breath at the intensity of his gaze and lowered her own eyes. \"And what, my lord, is my function as a goddess?\" \"You are the lady of life yet unborn, the untilled but fertile soil. You need only the touch of a god to make you into the goddess you were meant to be, a nurturer to rival the woman who birthed you. I will sow in you a new generation of divinity.\" The god who was Aphrodite's second-favorite lover smiled, the impressive manhood that graced his statues and temples on prominent display. Persephone tilted her head and met his eyes for the first time. She smiled, her voice as cold as the northern winds. \"You err, lord Hermes. I am not the earth. I am not a mortal woman, to dote upon you and be awed by your godliness. I am fully divine, daughter of Zeus and his fourth wife, and I will not bow to the product of some dalliance. And most of all, I am not my mother. Go back to Aphrodite, little brother, for you are not worthy of me.\" Persephone walked away, her head held high, and the forest rose up behind her, her dryads clinging to Hermes, slowing him as he followed until she could no longer hear his pleas. For a long time, there were no suitors. Persephone spent her days picking flowers and avoiding her doting mother, losing herself amongst the babbling of her nymphs. Then, one day, as she bent to pluck a narcissus from the soil, the earth split open in front of her. Clouds gathered in the heavens and a chariot roared out of the chasm, driven by a pale man with black hair. Hades grabbed her wrist and made to pull her into the chariot, but Persephone sought his eyes and bid him wait with all the authority she could muster. To her surprise, he calmed his horses but did not release her. She took a deep breath, and her voice did not waver. \"I have three questions for you, dread Hades, before I am yours. If you are to risk my mother's wrath, I would have you be sure of your choice.\" He regarded her with unblinking colorless eyes. \"Ask them, child, though it will make no difference.\" \"What color is my hair?\" She expected him to react with irritation - the elder Olympians had no patience for the games of the younger - but he merely stayed silent, as if giving the question great thought, and then answered. \"Blood, fresh-spilled.\" She tilted her head and stared at him. \"What would I be to you, my lord? What position would I hold in your heart?\" \"I would make you my queen.\" The answer made her inhale sharply, and widen her eyes. \"Ask your third question, and let us be done with it.\" Persephone leaned in and murmured, letting her voice drop from a girlish soprano to a rich, caressing contralto, \"And what, my lord, is my function as a goddess?\" \"You are rebirth. Through you, the denizens of my realm are given life and allowed to return to the sunlit lands. Through you, death is no prison.\" His regard was steady as he ascribed to her a power unattained by all the other gods of Olympus. \"Now, it is your turn to answer a question - what is my function?\" \"You are the king of the dead, the ruler of the unseen lands.\" Any mortal child knew that much, though they were too afraid to utter his name. He inclined his head, then his mouth split open in a ghastly death's head grin. \"I steal, I snatch, I leave wailing and grief in my wake. But the things I take, I preserve, away from the ravages of wind and age. One beautiful thing next to another looks common. Beauty amongst ugliness is transcendent.\" Finally, Persephone smiled, slow and inviting, and the earth shuddered closed, leaving only a scattered bouquet and warm golden laughter in its wake. The underworld was like nothing she'd ever known. It had nothing of her mother or father in it, no chains made of love and flowers, no ever-watchful clouds. She walked among the dead and they threw themselves at her feet. She was the first breath of life to ever grace the halls of the underworld, and all its denizens turned their faces toward her like flowers to the sun. She thought that the land of the dead would have been dreary, as colorless as it was lifeless, and it did seem that way, at first. But then Persephone started to see glimmers of gold veins in the ceiling, precious gemstones in the walls, reflecting the soft glow of phosphorescent crystals. The palette was dark, but somehow richer than all the bright flowers and trees of her home above. Hades had been right - surrounded by grey and black stone, the merest flash of color was enough to make her want to weep with joy, and notice it in places where she would have never bothered to look before. In the darkness, she could see more clearly than she ever could under the sun. All the while, Hades haunted her footsteps, keeping a silent, respectful distance, and making none of the advances that she would have expected from a brother of Zeus. She asked him about it once, when she could take no more of the heavy hush that suffused the air. The king of the dead looked somewhat amused - for him, anyways, though it was only shown by the barest quirk of his eyebrow. \"My siblings tend to be somewhat predictable - the later they were conceived, the more foolish they are, the more they crave love and companionship, the greater the lengths they will go to obtain it. And Zeus is the youngest of us all.\" Persephone tilted her head at her host-captor-uncle, the second eldest of Cronus and Rhea's brood, save only for wise, solitary Hestia, the forever-virgin lady of home and hearth. \"That would make you almost not a fool at all, then, my lord.\" \"I never said that.\" His grey eyes were distant, unseeing and all-seeing, and Persephone thought of herself and why she was in the underworld at all, and she began to understand. \"Why me, my lord? Why choose me, from all the countless nymphs and maidens and goddesses in the world?\" \"Because death cannot exist without life, and life is meaningless without death.\" The words sank into her mind like a stone cast into still waters, and the ripples bounced against her heart. He was lonely, and she was a goddess without meaning or purpose. Mortal girls wove flower chains for her, but none of them revered her. None of them feared her as she knew they rightfully should. Her presence in the underworld was meant to change both of those things. His quiet voice broke across her thoughts, and she turned to see his bone-white hand held out to her. \"Come. I have something I want to show you.\" It turned out that the underworld wasn't quite as lifeless as she'd believed, either. Hades had brought her down through the earth into the very heart of his kingdom, bypassing the five rivers and not going so deep as to breach the darkness of Tartarus, so all she'd seen was the austere beauty of the central realm where Hades himself resided. After their talk, the first one they'd had since they'd arrived, Hades had hitched his chariot back up to his pale horses and helped her in, the horses' hooves churning the air as easily as they struck solid rock.. They didn't speak as the chariot plunged through the air, but the silence had been lanced and drained of tension, almost companionable by comparison. Slowly, the ground below them began to level out, to be covered by a thin layer of dust that eventually turned into dry dirt, unworthy of being called soil, which puffed up into little clouds when the horses and chariot landed. Rooted in the dirt were flowers, as far as the eye could see, ghostly pale and faintly luminous - asphodels, the flower of death and mourning. Persephone slipped, wordless, from the chariot and walked into the meadow, trailing her fingers along the flowers. They were more translucent, more unearthly than the ones that grew above the ground, but the buds opened when she touched them, alive in a way that little else in the underworld was - alive in a way that responded to her own nature. Here and there, the dead wandered the meadows, looking more peaceful than most she had seen so far. They paid her no heed, and just walked aimlessly amongst the flowers. \"These are the Asphodel Meadows, where reside the dead who were too virtuous for Tartarus, but not righteous enough for Elysium. Here, they drink the waters of oblivion, and find peace, but not joy.\" Persephone turned her head to look at Hades, who, for the first time since she had come to the underworld, wasn't watching her, but was looking out over the meadows with something like sorrow. \"This is the place that I would give to you for your own, so that instead of being trapped here, the souls could be reborn again into life. I would make you queen of all the underworld, but this would be your place, where I held no sway, and could not enter without your word.\" The goddess of life inclined her head and climbed back into the chariot. \"I should like to see the rest, my lord.\" The king of the dead drove his chariot around the borders of the underworld, keeping always one of the great rivers to his left. Rivers of pain and lamentation, hatred and oblivion and liquid flame. Persephone watched with a kind of morbid fascination as human souls were caught in eddies and dashed against the rocks, screaming without needing to pause for breath. \"What did they do, that they are tormented like this?\" \"This realm is not Tartarus, the humans here are not punished for their misdeeds in life. If a soul is caught in the great rivers, it is because they tried to escape, and now they shall serve as an example for others. Eventually, they will wash up on the shore, their wills broken, their humanity forgotten.\" Hades tilted his head at the almost-invisible ghosts that drifted among the more tangible spirits. Persephone recognized the voiceless, faceless servants who had provided for her every want since she had arrived in the underworld. Across the river Phlegethon, a huge cliff rose, black even in the gloom of the underworld. By the light of the burning river, Persephone could just barely make out a path that wound its way up to a cave, set high up the side of the cliff. She waved a hand at it. \"That cave, what is it?\" \"You need not concern yourself with it, for it lies beyond the borders of the underworld.\" Hades's voice became even more distant and forbidding than it normally was, and a spark of rebellion stirred in Persephone's heart. She raised her chin and glared at her companion. \"I will concern myself with whatever I wish. And right now, I wish to know the importance of that cave.\" Anger kindled in his grey eyes, the first flicker of true emotion she'd seen from him yet, and a part of her gloried in the small victory, even though she knew she ought to have been afraid. \"That is the cave of the Moirae, the three goddesses who determine the fates of gods and mortals. They are not to be crossed or trifled with.\" The spinners of fate, the weavers of destiny, the casters of lots - even Zeus feared them. The Moirae would know what Persephone should do, for what purpose she was born, because they were the ones who had determined it. They would be able to tell her whether Hades was right about her powers, and her place at his side, or if he merely sought to trap her in the darkness forever. She shot Hades a sidelong glance. \"I don't intend to cross them, I want to consult them.\" His jaw twitched and tightened in irritation, and he drew the chariot to a stop. \"No.\" Persephone arched her brows and turned to face him. \"You said you would show me your realm.\" \"And that is not a part of my realm, thus I am under no contract to take you there. The Fates are not beings to consult on a whim.\" He lifted the reins as if to snap them, when a soft breath of air stirred his hair on the way to Persephone's ears, three female voices all whispering her name. A shudder rolled through the earth, and stepping stones broke the surface of the burning river. Persephone smiled in triumph and jumped out of the chariot, running towards the river before Hades could stop her. She paused before the stepping stones and gathered her filmy skirts, taking cautious steps onto the the oil-slick stones. The flames of the burning river licked at her ankles, and the rocks scorched the soles of her bare feet, but Persephone gritted her teeth against the pain and refused to look back, pride keeping her head high and her back straight, the whispered voices still urging her forward. Tears of agony rolled down her cheeks and evaporated in the heat. Once or twice she began to slip, leaving flesh stuck to the stones, but she recovered her balance and kept her eyes on the far shore, until finally her blackened, bleeding feet touched moist earth, so unlike the dry dirt of the underworld. She sank to her knees, gasping against the pain, and tilted her head back to take in the colossal height of the cliff before her. It was taller than she had thought, and much more shear - the path that was carved into the side was barely wide enough to stand on, and covered in sharp stones. Without the voice urging her forward, she might have given up and stayed there, crumpled in a heap, but not even a goddess ignores a direct summons from the Fates. With difficulty, Persephone rose to her feet, biting her lip at the pain of it. She put one graceless foot onto the steep path and her legs buckled beneath her. Bladelike obsidian lined the path and gouged her flesh as she pulled herself along on bloody hands and knees, inch by slow inch. Time ceased to flow as she ascended, her immortal body providing endless amounts of blood to mark her passage. After a seeming eternity of crawling, her body and mind numbed by pain and repetition, the stone beneath her hands flattened and smoothed. Feather-light fingers wrapped themselves around her arms, and Persephone found herself pulled, gently, to her feet by a translucent ghost with no face who slowly faded into nothingness before her eyes. A shrivelled old woman, whose voice Persephone recognized as one of the three that had called her here, cackled with glee. \"Unusual to see one of them up here. Seems they've taken something of a liking to you. Why ever could that be, hmm?\" The milky-eyed crone snapped the long, cruel shears in her hand over a piece of thread, and Persephone could have sworn that she heard a scream, somewhere in the distance. The young goddess tried to ignore her aching body and straightened her filthy hair and shredded dress, attempting and failing to find some semblance of her usual grace. She curtsied stiffly. \"It is an honor to meet you, my ladies.\" The seated sister, plump and matronly in a way that Demeter had never been, smiled with a great deal of warmth. \"Oh, my child, you have met us before, and you will meet us again, before the world is through.\" She measured a long, silvery thread and attached it to the small hand-loom on her lap, weaving skillfully. The last sister, a girl of surpassing beauty who teetered on the cusp of womanhood, looked up from her spinning wheel. Her eyes were without white or iris, like polished jet against the rich bronze of her skin. If the crone had the features of the northern barbarians, and the mother of the desert-dwellers to the east, then the maiden was cast in the mold of one of the warriors from beyond the rule of the Pharoah in Egypt. \"You had a question, didn't you?\" Persephone drew a deep, steadying breath into her lungs and nodded. \"What is my purpose? Am I my mother's daughter, or Hades's queen?\" All three Fates spoke at once, their voices blending into one. \"Both.\" The white-haired crone smiled. \"And also neither. You are yourself, girl. Your powers do not come from your mother or your husband, but from within. You have been the ruler of the underworld since long before Zeus spurted you into Demeter's womb, and you will continue to be, regardless of whether you sit the black throne or pick flowers in the sunlight.\" Persephone blinked in confusion. \"Ruler of the underworld? But Hades...\" The middle sister shook her head and smiled, her silvery-grey curls bouncing beneath her veil. \"Hades is the underworld, my child, just as Gaea is the earth. And you are his queen - not by virtue of being his consort, but because you were made to rule him. A marriage between the two of you would be symbolic of you taking up your duties, like the humans who wed king to priestess to show devotion to a goddess.\" The decrepit old woman snorted in derision. \"You've seen what happens when men rule things. Zeus's father and grandfather were tyrants. So when the Olympians came to power, we decided to have a few queens instead. Your mother got stewardship of the earth, you get the underworld, that idiot Hera was supposed to be the Queen of Heaven, but she and Zeus are both convinced that he's in charge.\" She hawked and spat, as if the royal couple's names had left a foul taste in her mouth. \"Hades has just been keeping the throne warm for you. Well, figuratively speaking. I doubt he could keep much of anything warm.\" She grinned, her gums black and toothless. A silence fell as Persephone stood, attempting to take in the crone's words, but it was broken by the girl's soft voice. \"He came to us, you know. He knows that neither he nor the underworld are easy to love, and he didn't want to start out wrong with you. So he came by the same way you did, bloodied and humble, and asked us for answers to your riddles that would please you, though it pains him to leave the underworld for long. The petitioner's route grants but one answer to one question - he owes us favors for the other two.\" \"No god likes to owe a debt, least of all him. I think you should give him a chance. He's rather cold, and not too good with women, but he has been longing for you. I know, I made him that way. Fate is even stronger than Aphrodite, you know.\" The mother smiled rather dreamily, her grey eyes distant. The crone shook her head, mouth twisting in distaste at the sentiment in her sister's voice, but did not comment. Instead, she said, \"You have three choices, girl.\" \"You can leave the underworld forever, and go back to your mother,\" said the maiden, \"You can marry Hades and take up your crown,\" said the mother, \"Or you can kick the stiff bastard out of your castle and rule alone,\" finished the crone with a sharp cackle. \"He spoke truly when he told you what your power was, you know.\" The spinner bent over her wheel, her rich voice almost a murmur. \"You are rebirth, and because of that, you stand with one foot in death and the other in life. It is your nature to feel conflicted, but only you can make your choice.\" Persephone closed her mouth, strangling the request for more advice. She had asked one question and gotten one answer, best not to press further. The older the deity, the more capricious they could be, and there was only one goddess in the universe older than the Fates. Instead, she executed another wobbly curtsy. \"Thank you, daughters of Night, for your wisdom.\" The Moirae had already turned back to their work, dismissing her without words, and Persephone turned with slowly-growing horror to look at the treacherous path that had brought her to the cave. Red flowers bloomed amidst the stones, growing wherever her blood had fallen. The path looked almost inviting, covered as it was with petals that were almost luminescent in their brightness. The flowers would only mask the edges and pitfalls of the obsidian, and the stepping stones that had allowed her to cross the Phlegethon were gone entirely. The fear of the trek back down bore down on her like a weight, nearly driving her again to her knees. She turned to ask the Fates for passage, and damn the debt, when a soft snort of hot breath stirred the hair over one ear. Hades's chariot floated in the air, and its master leaned over, his face drawn with the effort of keeping the chariot aloft beyond the boundaries of the underworld. He extended a hand, and, grateful beyond words, Persephone took it and half-stepped, half-stumbled into the chariot. She watched him as he snapped the reins and smoothly drew away from the cave, back over the burning river and towards his - her? - stone palace, looming in the distance. He was not so ugly as she'd once thought. Gaunt, yes, almost to the point of being skeletal, and bone-pale, but without the heavy beard of his brothers, and with thick, straight black hair that looked almost soft in the half-light. No doubt feeling her eyes on him, Hades flicked a glance her direction. \"I sought to keep you from taking that road to save you the pain of it. I am sorry I did not succeed.\" Warmth mixed with irritation flooded her, and she wasn't sure which one was stronger, so she just huffed and looked out at the underworld spread out beneath her. \"It was my choice, though a warning might have been nice.\" Her statement met with only silence. His motives might have been admirable, but Persephone had always been willful, always rebellious. To forbid her from something was the fastest way to drive her to it. After all, she hadn't started interviewing suitors until her mother had hidden her away from anything vaguely resembling a male. She sighed, and they passed most of the way to the palace before she spoke again. \"The ladies, they said I was born to rule here. And that they gave you the answers to my riddles.\" Hades stared out at nothing for long enough that Persephone began to wonder if he was just ignoring her, but eventually he spoke. \"I did not want to have to take you against your will. If I answered right, then you would come of your own accord, and you would not hate me for bringing you here.\" \"But you would have taken me anyway, regardless of how I'd reacted to your answers.\" \"Yes.\" No hesitation in his voice, nor remorse. Persephone tilted her head in thought. \"Why?\" \"Because you belong here. Because you were made for me, and I for you. Because the Fates have decreed it.\" Persephone sighed and looked down at her hands, the cuts sealed and healing slowly. The scars would fade in time, where they wouldn't on human hands. In time, she would have nothing but her memory to tell the tale of her trial. What would her mother say, if she knew? She would wail, most likely, and rage and vow vengeance against he who permitted her to injure herself this way. Demeter would have swooped in and snatched her off the stepping stones of the Phlegethon without a second's thought, for her own good, of course. Hades, though he sought to keep her from choosing, at least let her go through with her choice once she'd made it. It was a poor freedom, but better than any that love had ever afforded her. \"My mother loves me. Do you love me, Hades?\" He looked at her, long and searching, until finally, grudgingly, as if he had pulled out his own liver and served it to her on a bed of leafy greens: \"I need you, Persephone. Is that not enough?\" She turned away, and would not meet his eyes. Only the Fates yet knew the answer to that particular riddle. Persephone knelt in the Asphodel Meadows, digging up a few of the luminous flowers to be transplanted into pots, to brighten up her drafty stone bedroom, and perhaps to take with her when, or if, she returned to the surface. The ghosts paid her no heed and just drifted along, as if they were unconsciously giving her a wide berth. Hades was in his castle, holding court, and she had slipped out the back door and made her way alone, if one could ever be alone in a place that was teeming with human souls. She had just extricated the root system of one of the smaller plants when the flowers to her right rustled and then abruptly stopped. Persephone glanced up, and found herself eye-to-eye with the shade of a small girl, who was staring at her with slightly vacant eyes. The girl said nothing, but that was more acknowledgement of the goddess's presence than she had previously received, and to be honest, she craved female companionship. Persephone smiled in a way that she hoped was reassuring, and lifted a hand in a wave. \"Hello there.\" \"Hello.\" Her voice was wispy, and her face was still expressionless, but Persephone was heartened by the response. \"What's your name, little one?\" The girl just blinked. \"Name?\" \"Yes. What are you called?\" A brief flicker of confusion passed over her face, and then disappeared into emptiness again. \"I am called nothing. No one calls me.\" The girl turned her head and wandered off, her steps light but aimless. Persephone had known that the souls in the Asphodel Meadows had drank of the river Lethe, which induces them to forget their lives, but she had not known that it stripped from them even their names. The girl in front of her was empty, and she would wander the meadow until the end of time, without even the memories of her short life to occupy her. This was what passed for peace in Hades. This was the best that those who were not blessed by a god would ever achieve after their death. Persephone finished embedding the asphodel she had uprooted into the pot as she thought. She had been selfish, thinking only of her own place in the world. The deathless gods rarely gave more than a passing thought to the mortals who worshipped them, and never at all after they were dead. It seemed cruel to have created these people in the image of the gods, but then doom them to brief lives that give way to nothing but darkness. \"Through you, death is no prison.\" Hades's words had caught her attention first for the power they held, but Persephone was beginning to see the deeper layers beneath. Her parents would tell her that it was the right of an Olympian to put her own wishes above that of humanity. This was her chance to be different from her family, to set herself apart from her philandering father and brothers, her jealous aunt and sisters. It was just one more choice to make. Persephone sighed and picked up her potted asphodel, heading back towards the castle. Her entire future had narrowed down to a single hard choice that nothing in her life had ever prepared her to make. Eventually, news spread in the underworld, from the newly deceased all the way up to Hades himself, of a great famine that was sweeping the Earth. Crops withered in the fields, no matter how much care they were tended with. More souls than ever before crowded the banks of the Acheron, waiting to be ferried across, all while wailing of the cruelty of the Lady of Grain. She would permit nothing to grow until her daughter was returned to her. Persephone had known that her mother would be furious with her for leaving, likely inconsolable, but to abandon her duties, to sentence countless mortals to death? Persephone didn't know whether it was rage, grief, or spite that fueled her mother's actions, but it was as if she had gone completely mad. Hades seemed unsurprised. \"The humans fear the power of the gods - Zeus's lightning, Poseidon's earthquakes, the very mention of my name - but it is the goddesses that they should truly fear, for their wrath is slow, but utterly without mercy. A dead race pays no tribute; I should expect Hermes to come and take you from here soon, once Zeus has gotten over his pride and acquiesced to Demeter's demands.\" The flower goddess took a deep breath. \"And if I chose to stay?\" Emotion flashed, almost too quickly to catch, across the death god's face. \"Is that what you desire?\" Heavy red hair fell around Persephone's face as she stared at the stone beneath her feet. Her hair was darker than it had been when she left the sunlit lands, and her freckles had all but faded entirely, leaving her skin the color of flawless ivory. She looked like an entirely different goddess, and felt like one, as well. There was a large part of her that yearned for flowers and the companionship of her mother and maiden sisters, but there was another that looked at the underworld and saw beauty, possibility, and a kind of freedom that she'd never known - the freedom that comes from power and responsibility, rather than the lack of obligations. She looked back up into Hades's grey eyes, and saw yearning there, and hope. If she closed her eyes, she could see her mother's anguish - her overbearing, overprotective, beautiful, wonderful mother, whom she couldn't bear the thought of never seeing again. \"I don't know.\" Hades said nothing, just turned and walked into his dining room. Curious, and a little guilty for being unable to answer him how he wished, Persephone followed. On the stone table, amidst the golden apples, nectar, and ambrosia, lay a single pomegranate, sliced neatly in half. Hades offered one of the halves to her. \"No one, whether mortal or god, can escape the clutches of the underworld once they have tasted of its fruit. Zeus and Demeter could not keep you from this place, but neither could your own desire.\" Persephone took the proffered fruit and cradled it delicately in her palms. \"But I would be permitted to leave? And how often would I have to return?\" \"A few months out of every year, at the least - more, if you so chose.\" \"And if I did not return of my own accord?\" Hades grinned, black and horrific, as he had when he had first stolen his potential bride. It did not frighten her, though she felt it should have. \"You would return to me, whether by your choice or by your death, transitory as that is for an Olympian.\" \"Would it be death that snatched me back, my lord, or would it be you?\" The dead god raised his eyebrows. \"Is there a difference?\" \"There is to me.\" And it was true. She did not love him, but there was a piece of her that was intrigued by him, who had looked at a goddess who had been permitted no responsibilities or purpose in life, and had seen a woman who would command even death. He was solemn again, as he almost always was, and placed a hand against his chest. \"Then I promise, Persephone, that if anything tries to keep you from me, I will come for you myself.\" Without any further hesitation, Persephone dug her fingers into the pomegranate and pulled them out, bloody and glistening. The red flesh disappeared between her red lips and wrote her fate in crimson, binding herself to the land of the dead. The half-eaten fruit tumbled out of her hand, and Persephone pressed her mouth to Hades's own, the headiness of the pomegranate melding with the taste of bone and ash. Wordless and intent, she urged him down to the floor, crowning herself queen with pomegranate juice and a broken maidenhead. Torchlight cast strange, flickering shadows on the walls of the throne room where the queen of the underworld and her consort held court, seated in two immense stone thrones of equal height. The sea of petitioning dead parted to make way for the torchbearer, a veiled maiden with black hair. Hades regarded the interloper with his usual stony-faced stoicism, but Persephone leaned forward in curiosity. The woman was less ephemeral than the spirits surrounding her, and the shadows around her seemed to suggest two other female figures, also holding torches, facing to the side and away. She was three-in-one, with a hound pacing calmly at her feet. The king of the dead finally inclined his head in respect, and acknowledged her. \"Hecate. What brings you to my threshold?\" The triple goddess smiled, and her three voices held at once amusement, derision, and gravity. \"Oh, I believe you already know the answer to that, great Aidoneus. Demeter rages and weeps for her daughter's absence, and has entreated me to return her, whole and unmolested.\" She narrowed her eyes and leveled a look at Persephone, taking in the crown and heavy dress of a queen, not a captured maiden. \"I see that I am too late for that.\" Persephone simply spread her hands in a helpless gesture. \"What has been done has been done, and it was by my own choice, and no fault of anyone else. How long have I been gone from the upper world?\" \"Half a year, my lady. Zeus is beginning to buckle under the pressure of Demeter and the mortals, and it is said that he will send Hermes to retrieve you any day now. I thought that perhaps you would prefer that I guide you. Considering how your refusal of him made him the laughingstock of Olympus, I doubt he would treat you gently.\" The queen of the dead inclined her head and rose to her feet. \"Very well. I will go with you. To be honest, my heart longs to see my mother and half-sisters again. And in half a year's time, you will escort me back here to my husband.\" Hecate hesitated, two of her voices murmuring in surprise. \"Your mother will not be pleased with that, and even the lady of the crossroads must fear the Corn-Mother's rage.\" Persephone waved a hand towards the sapling that grew between her throne and Hades's, planted with the seeds of the pomegranate that had bound her to him. \"I'm afraid there's nothing anyone can do about it.\" With a small bow, Hecate walked to the entrance of the great room and held up her torch, lighting the way. Before Persephone could follow her, however, Hades rose from his throne and caught her hand in his. \"You will come back.\" He said it like a statement, but there was a question lurking beneath the surface, an irrational uncertainty about whether she would break a promise bound in blood. She smiled, a brief flash of fondness blooming in her heart, and pressed a hand to his cheek. \"Of course. And if I don't, you'll come and fetch me.\" With a light, lingering kiss and a smile, she slipped out of his grasp and out of his realm, leaving the underworld somehow more cold and dead than before she'd arrived. The sun was brighter than Persephone had remembered, the sky a more dazzling shade of blue. These were the only beauties she found when she emerged from the darkness, however - the land, as far as she could see, was barren and desolate. Trees clawed the sky with skeletal branches, and dry flower petals crunched under her bare feet. A small semi-circle of people stood a small distance away. In the center was a hunched old woman whom Persephone only barely recognized as her mother, with silver liberally threading her wheat-blonde hair. Directly behind her stood an enormous, bearded man, who spoke with a voice like thunder, \"Well, Demeter? Are you pleased? Will you lift this thrice-damned curse now that you have you precious daughter back?\" Demeter straightened a little, casting a venomous glance back at her once-husband. \"I would have been pleased that you had not sold her off like cattle to our elder brother in the first place. I have not forgiven you - you are merely rectifying your mistake by returning her to me.\" Appearing to give him no further thought, the earth-mother walked across the small field to where her daughter stood, small green shoots pushing themselves out of the ground around her feet. \"Though it would appear that she is not to remain with me, is she?\" Persephone reached over and cradled her mother's wrinkled cheeks in her hands, watching silently as the skin tightened and the silver in her hair gave way to gold. \"No, mother. My place is in the underworld. It always has been. I'm needed there. I have power there. We made a deal, though - half the year below, and half above. One foot in the grave, and the other in the meadow.\" Demeter drew her daughter to her in a fierce embrace, then stepped back, clearly unsure whether to feel grateful or betrayed. After a moment of staring in consternation, she threw up her hands and turned back to the assembled Olympians. \"So be it! As long as Persephone walks the soil of the sunlit lands, I will permit things to grow. When she leaves the mortal world, so will life.\" Turning back to her daughter, she shook her head anxiously. \"I would have kept you safe, forever innocent of the horrors of death and the cruelties of men, free from the demands of gods and mortals.\" The lady of spring just smiled faintly. \"I know. But that innocence came at a price that I wasn't willing to pay anymore. In protecting me, you denied me purpose and fulfillment, denied me the potential to be anything but a silly little girl who spent her days picking flowers. Your experiences are not my own -- not all husbands are cruel, death holds more joy for me than horror, and there is no true escape from the demands of gods or men. I know you feared that I would fall victim to the same empty promises that you did, but I chose this. In doing so, I became not merely a vessel for life, but the life that follows death.\" She indicated the slowly blossoming meadow, an expanding circle of greenery with herself at its heart. \"Very well. When you are done with this lot,\" she waved a hand at the restless gods behind her, \"come find me. There's work to be done, and you will help me with it.\" Persephone watched her mother walk away, beauty restored but shoulders slumped with loss. She raised her own chin and walked towards the rest of her family, greeting them without the obeisance she would have given before her time in the underworld. She was the goddess of spring and rebirth, the daughter of the earth. Even among the living and the deathless gods, she was still the queen of Hades.",

      "The sun god, beautiful even among the peerless Olympians, radiated his pleasure upon seeing her.",
      "She smiled at his praises and his smug confidence, and pressed a gentle hand against his chest when he swooped in to claim her lips for his own.",
      "\"I have three questions for you, shining Apollo, before I am yours.",
      "If I am to defy my mother, I wish to be certain of my choice.\"",
      "He laughed.",
      "\"Ask them, then.",
      "You will not be disappointed.\"",
      "\"What color is my hair?\"",
      "The sun god wrapped a lock of her long, long hair around a finger, raised it to his lips and kissed it.",
      "\"Your hair is the color of the sky at sunset, with the glorious luminance of the sun as it descends into the western sea.\"",
      "Persephone only smiled.",
      "\"What would I be to you, my lord?",
      "What position would I hold in your heart?\"",
      "The god of music placed one hand on her waist and a hand against her cheek, leaning in to whisper into her ear, \"You would be my lover, my mistress, my muse.",
      "I would compose songs to your beauty and make love to you on a bed of clouds.\"",
      "Persephone sighed in pleasure.",
      "\"And what, my lord, is my function as a goddess?\"",
      "The god of youth moved his hand from her waist to her belly, pressing hard and sliding downwards.",
      "\"You are spring, my flower, you are birth and youth and nature.\"",
      "Still smiling, Persephone twisted out of Apollo's grasp, her voice filled with poisonous sweetness.",
      "\"You are eloquent, it is true, and beautiful.",
      "But you see only your own glory reflected in me, my lord.",
      "If you love yourself so dearly, I would advise finding yourself a mirror, or perhaps a twin?\"",
      "She raised her eyebrows and smiled at his slowly growing fury.",
      "\"You think of me as the maiden goddess of birth and youth, yet that is clearly your sister's role.",
      "I have heard of your jealousies, of how you murdered Orion, the only man who stirred her to reject her chastity.",
      "You would not marry me, because it is Artemis you desire.",
      "Be on your way, little brother, I will not be second to any woman in my lover's heart.\"",
      "She bounded away, laughing merrily at his shouts, her only pursuers.",
      "Next came Hermes, the forever-traveling messenger of the gods.",
      "Though he was fleet of foot, she caught him in a wooded grove, stripped nude and kneeling by a pool to drink.",
      "He approached her with more deference than Apollo, but there was a light of conquest in his eyes and hunger in his smile.",
      "She lowered her lashes and smiled demurely at him.",
      "\"I have three questions for you, cunning Hermes, before I am yours.",
      "If I am to defy my mother, I wish to be certain of my choice.\"",
      "He lounged back on the grass, unconcerned.",
      "\"If it is a test of my wits, my lady Kore, you will not find me lacking.\"",
      "His smile widened.",
      "\"Nor in other areas, unlike my girlish brother Apollo.\"",
      "Persephone giggled into her hand and blushed.",
      "\"My lord, what color is my hair?\"",
      "\"I am no poet, my lady, but to me, your hair is the color of copper veins in the earth, of warm red clay.\"",
      "The god of athleticism stretched his arms and arched his back as he spoke, letting the dappled sunlight play over well-sculpted muscles.",
      "Persephone averted her eyes but stole an admiring glance every now and again.",
      "\"What would I be to you, my lord?",
      "What position would I hold in your heart?\"",
      "\"You would be my wife, for no other position would suit a daughter of Zeus and Demeter.",
      "You would keep my home and be there to welcome me when I return from my duties, to rub my feet and ease my aching heart, and I would see that you were well taken care of.\"",
      "The god of commerce and protection smiled and rose to his feet, pacing in circles around her, eyes tracking possessively over her curves.",
      "Persephone caught her breath at the intensity of his gaze and lowered her own eyes.",
      "\"And what, my lord, is my function as a goddess?\"",
      "\"You are the lady of life yet unborn, the untilled but fertile soil.",
      "You need only the touch of a god to make you into the goddess you were meant to be, a nurturer to rival the woman who birthed you.",
      "I will sow in you a new generation of divinity.\"",
      "The god who was Aphrodite's second-favorite lover smiled, the impressive manhood that graced his statues and temples on prominent display.",
      "Persephone tilted her head and met his eyes for the first time.",
      "She smiled, her voice as cold as the northern winds.",
      "\"You err, lord Hermes.",
      "I am not the earth.",
      "I am not a mortal woman, to dote upon you and be awed by your godliness.",
      "I am fully divine, daughter of Zeus and his fourth wife, and I will not bow to the product of some dalliance.",
      "And most of all, I am not my mother.",
      "Go back to Aphrodite, little brother, for you are not worthy of me.\"",
      "Persephone walked away, her head held high, and the forest rose up behind her, her dryads clinging to Hermes, slowing him as he followed until she could no longer hear his pleas.",
      "For a long time, there were no suitors.",
      "Persephone spent her days picking flowers and avoiding her doting mother, losing herself amongst the babbling of her nymphs.",
      "Then, one day, as she bent to pluck a narcissus from the soil, the earth split open in front of her.",
      "Clouds gathered in the heavens and a chariot roared out of the chasm, driven by a pale man with black hair.",
      "Hades grabbed her wrist and made to pull her into the chariot, but Persephone sought his eyes and bid him wait with all the authority she could muster.",
      "To her surprise, he calmed his horses but did not release her.",
      "She took a deep breath, and her voice did not waver.",
      "\"I have three questions for you, dread Hades, before I am yours.",
      "If you are to risk my mother's wrath, I would have you be sure of your choice.\"",
      "He regarded her with unblinking colorless eyes.",
      "\"Ask them, child, though it will make no difference.\"",
      "\"What color is my hair?\"",
      "She expected him to react with irritation - the elder Olympians had no patience for the games of the younger - but he merely stayed silent, as if giving the question great thought, and then answered.",
      "\"Blood, fresh-spilled.\"",
      "She tilted her head and stared at him.",
      "\"What would I be to you, my lord?",
      "What position would I hold in your heart?\"",
      "\"I would make you my queen.\"",
      "The answer made her inhale sharply, and widen her eyes.",
      "\"Ask your third question, and let us be done with it.\"",
      "Persephone leaned in and murmured, letting her voice drop from a girlish soprano to a rich, caressing contralto, \"And what, my lord, is my function as a goddess?\"",
      "\"You are rebirth.",
      "Through you, the denizens of my realm are given life and allowed to return to the sunlit lands.",
      "Through you, death is no prison.\"",
      "His regard was steady as he ascribed to her a power unattained by all the other gods of Olympus.",
      "\"Now, it is your turn to answer a question - what is my function?\"",
      "\"You are the king of the dead, the ruler of the unseen lands.\"",
      "Any mortal child knew that much, though they were too afraid to utter his name.",
      "He inclined his head, then his mouth split open in a ghastly death's head grin.",
      "\"I steal, I snatch, I leave wailing and grief in my wake.",
      "But the things I take, I preserve, away from the ravages of wind and age.",
      "One beautiful thing next to another looks common.",
      "Beauty amongst ugliness is transcendent.\"",
      "Finally, Persephone smiled, slow and inviting, and the earth shuddered closed, leaving only a scattered bouquet and warm golden laughter in its wake.",
      "The underworld was like nothing she'd ever known.",
      "It had nothing of her mother or father in it, no chains made of love and flowers, no ever-watchful clouds.",
      "She walked among the dead and they threw themselves at her feet.",
      "She was the first breath of life to ever grace the halls of the underworld, and all its denizens turned their faces toward her like flowers to the sun.",
      "She thought that the land of the dead would have been dreary, as colorless as it was lifeless, and it did seem that way, at first.",
      "But then Persephone started to see glimmers of gold veins in the ceiling, precious gemstones in the walls, reflecting the soft glow of phosphorescent crystals.",
      "The palette was dark, but somehow richer than all the bright flowers and trees of her home above.",
      "Hades had been right - surrounded by grey and black stone, the merest flash of color was enough to make her want to weep with joy, and notice it in places where she would have never bothered to look before.",
      "In the darkness, she could see more clearly than she ever could under the sun.",
      "All the while, Hades haunted her footsteps, keeping a silent, respectful distance, and making none of the advances that she would have expected from a brother of Zeus.",
      "She asked him about it once, when she could take no more of the heavy hush that suffused the air.",
      "The king of the dead looked somewhat amused - for him, anyways, though it was only shown by the barest quirk of his eyebrow.",
      "\"My siblings tend to be somewhat predictable - the later they were conceived, the more foolish they are, the more they crave love and companionship, the greater the lengths they will go to obtain it.",
      "And Zeus is the youngest of us all.\"",
      "Persephone tilted her head at her host-captor-uncle, the second eldest of Cronus and Rhea's brood, save only for wise, solitary Hestia, the forever-virgin lady of home and hearth.",
      "\"That would make you almost not a fool at all, then, my lord.\"",
      "\"I never said that.\"",
      "His grey eyes were distant, unseeing and all-seeing, and Persephone thought of herself and why she was in the underworld at all, and she began to understand.",
      "\"Why me, my lord?",
      "Why choose me, from all the countless nymphs and maidens and goddesses in the world?\"",
      "\"Because death cannot exist without life, and life is meaningless without death.\"",
      "The words sank into her mind like a stone cast into still waters, and the ripples bounced against her heart.",
      "He was lonely, and she was a goddess without meaning or purpose.",
      "Mortal girls wove flower chains for her, but none of them revered her.",
      "None of them feared her as she knew they rightfully should.",
      "Her presence in the underworld was meant to change both of those things.",
      "His quiet voice broke across her thoughts, and she turned to see his bone-white hand held out to her.",
      "\"Come.",
      "I have something I want to show you.\"",
      "It turned out that the underworld wasn't quite as lifeless as she'd believed, either.",
      "Hades had brought her down through the earth into the very heart of his kingdom, bypassing the five rivers and not going so deep as to breach the darkness of Tartarus, so all she'd seen was the austere beauty of the central realm where Hades himself resided.",
      "After their talk, the first one they'd had since they'd arrived, Hades had hitched his chariot back up to his pale horses and helped her in, the horses' hooves churning the air as easily as they struck solid rock..",
      "They didn't speak as the chariot plunged through the air, but the silence had been lanced and drained of tension, almost companionable by comparison.",
      "Slowly, the ground below them began to level out, to be covered by a thin layer of dust that eventually turned into dry dirt, unworthy of being called soil, which puffed up into little clouds when the horses and chariot landed.",
      "Rooted in the dirt were flowers, as far as the eye could see, ghostly pale and faintly luminous - asphodels, the flower of death and mourning.",
      "Persephone slipped, wordless, from the chariot and walked into the meadow, trailing her fingers along the flowers.",
      "They were more translucent, more unearthly than the ones that grew above the ground, but the buds opened when she touched them, alive in a way that little else in the underworld was - alive in a way that responded to her own nature.",
      "Here and there, the dead wandered the meadows, looking more peaceful than most she had seen so far.",
      "They paid her no heed, and just walked aimlessly amongst the flowers.",
      "\"These are the Asphodel Meadows, where reside the dead who were too virtuous for Tartarus, but not righteous enough for Elysium.",
      "Here, they drink the waters of oblivion, and find peace, but not joy.\"",
      "Persephone turned her head to look at Hades, who, for the first time since she had come to the underworld, wasn't watching her, but was looking out over the meadows with something like sorrow.",
      "\"This is the place that I would give to you for your own, so that instead of being trapped here, the souls could be reborn again into life.",
      "I would make you queen of all the underworld, but this would be your place, where I held no sway, and could not enter without your word.\"",
      "The goddess of life inclined her head and climbed back into the chariot.",
      "\"I should like to see the rest, my lord.\"",
      "The king of the dead drove his chariot around the borders of the underworld, keeping always one of the great rivers to his left.",
      "Rivers of pain and lamentation, hatred and oblivion and liquid flame.",
      "Persephone watched with a kind of morbid fascination as human souls were caught in eddies and dashed against the rocks, screaming without needing to pause for breath.",
      "\"What did they do, that they are tormented like this?\"",
      "\"This realm is not Tartarus, the humans here are not punished for their misdeeds in life.",
      "If a soul is caught in the great rivers, it is because they tried to escape, and now they shall serve as an example for others.",
      "Eventually, they will wash up on the shore, their wills broken, their humanity forgotten.\"",
      "Hades tilted his head at the almost-invisible ghosts that drifted among the more tangible spirits.",
      "Persephone recognized the voiceless, faceless servants who had provided for her every want since she had arrived in the underworld.",
      "Across the river Phlegethon, a huge cliff rose, black even in the gloom of the underworld.",
      "By the light of the burning river, Persephone could just barely make out a path that wound its way up to a cave, set high up the side of the cliff.",
      "She waved a hand at it.",
      "\"That cave, what is it?\"",
      "\"You need not concern yourself with it, for it lies beyond the borders of the underworld.\"",
      "Hades's voice became even more distant and forbidding than it normally was, and a spark of rebellion stirred in Persephone's heart.",
      "She raised her chin and glared at her companion.",
      "\"I will concern myself with whatever I wish.",
      "And right now, I wish to know the importance of that cave.\"",
      "Anger kindled in his grey eyes, the first flicker of true emotion she'd seen from him yet, and a part of her gloried in the small victory, even though she knew she ought to have been afraid.",
      "\"That is the cave of the Moirae, the three goddesses who determine the fates of gods and mortals.",
      "They are not to be crossed or trifled with.\"",
      "The spinners of fate, the weavers of destiny, the casters of lots - even Zeus feared them.",
      "The Moirae would know what Persephone should do, for what purpose she was born, because they were the ones who had determined it.",
      "They would be able to tell her whether Hades was right about her powers, and her place at his side, or if he merely sought to trap her in the darkness forever.",
      "She shot Hades a sidelong glance.",
      "\"I don't intend to cross them, I want to consult them.\"",
      "His jaw twitched and tightened in irritation, and he drew the chariot to a stop.",
      "\"No.\"",
      "Persephone arched her brows and turned to face him.",
      "\"You said you would show me your realm.\"",
      "\"And that is not a part of my realm, thus I am under no contract to take you there.",
      "The Fates are not beings to consult on a whim.\"",
      "He lifted the reins as if to snap them, when a soft breath of air stirred his hair on the way to Persephone's ears, three female voices all whispering her name.",
      "A shudder rolled through the earth, and stepping stones broke the surface of the burning river.",
      "Persephone smiled in triumph and jumped out of the chariot, running towards the river before Hades could stop her.",
      "She paused before the stepping stones and gathered her filmy skirts, taking cautious steps onto the the oil-slick stones.",
      "The flames of the burning river licked at her ankles, and the rocks scorched the soles of her bare feet, but Persephone gritted her teeth against the pain and refused to look back, pride keeping her head high and her back straight, the whispered voices still urging her forward.",
      "Tears of agony rolled down her cheeks and evaporated in the heat.",
      "Once or twice she began to slip, leaving flesh stuck to the stones, but she recovered her balance and kept her eyes on the far shore, until finally her blackened, bleeding feet touched moist earth, so unlike the dry dirt of the underworld.",
      "She sank to her knees, gasping against the pain, and tilted her head back to take in the colossal height of the cliff before her.",
      "It was taller than she had thought, and much more shear - the path that was carved into the side was barely wide enough to stand on, and covered in sharp stones.",
      "Without the voice urging her forward, she might have given up and stayed there, crumpled in a heap, but not even a goddess ignores a direct summons from the Fates.",
      "With difficulty, Persephone rose to her feet, biting her lip at the pain of it.",
      "She put one graceless foot onto the steep path and her legs buckled beneath her.",
      "Bladelike obsidian lined the path and gouged her flesh as she pulled herself along on bloody hands and knees, inch by slow inch.",
      "Time ceased to flow as she ascended, her immortal body providing endless amounts of blood to mark her passage.",
      "After a seeming eternity of crawling, her body and mind numbed by pain and repetition, the stone beneath her hands flattened and smoothed.",
      "Feather-light fingers wrapped themselves around her arms, and Persephone found herself pulled, gently, to her feet by a translucent ghost with no face who slowly faded into nothingness before her eyes.",
      "A shrivelled old woman, whose voice Persephone recognized as one of the three that had called her here, cackled with glee.",
      "\"Unusual to see one of them up here.",
      "Seems they've taken something of a liking to you.",
      "Why ever could that be, hmm?\"",
      "The milky-eyed crone snapped the long, cruel shears in her hand over a piece of thread, and Persephone could have sworn that she heard a scream, somewhere in the distance.",
      "The young goddess tried to ignore her aching body and straightened her filthy hair and shredded dress, attempting and failing to find some semblance of her usual grace.",
      "She curtsied stiffly.",
      "\"It is an honor to meet you, my ladies.\"",
      "The seated sister, plump and matronly in a way that Demeter had never been, smiled with a great deal of warmth.",
      "\"Oh, my child, you have met us before, and you will meet us again, before the world is through.\"",
      "She measured a long, silvery thread and attached it to the small hand-loom on her lap, weaving skillfully.",
      "The last sister, a girl of surpassing beauty who teetered on the cusp of womanhood, looked up from her spinning wheel.",
      "Her eyes were without white or iris, like polished jet against the rich bronze of her skin.",
      "If the crone had the features of the northern barbarians, and the mother of the desert-dwellers to the east, then the maiden was cast in the mold of one of the warriors from beyond the rule of the Pharoah in Egypt.",
      "\"You had a question, didn't you?\" Persephone drew a deep, steadying breath into her lungs and nodded.",
      "\"What is my purpose?",
      "Am I my mother's daughter, or Hades's queen?\"",
      "All three Fates spoke at once, their voices blending into one.",
      "\"Both.\"",
      "The white-haired crone smiled.",
      "\"And also neither.",
      "You are yourself, girl.",
      "Your powers do not come from your mother or your husband, but from within.",
      "You have been the ruler of the underworld since long before Zeus spurted you into Demeter's womb, and you will continue to be, regardless of whether you sit the black throne or pick flowers in the sunlight.\"",
      "Persephone blinked in confusion.",
      "\"Ruler of the underworld?",
      "But Hades...\" The middle sister shook her head and smiled, her silvery-grey curls bouncing beneath her veil.",
      "\"Hades is the underworld, my child, just as Gaea is the earth.",
      "And you are his queen - not by virtue of being his consort, but because you were made to rule him.",
      "A marriage between the two of you would be symbolic of you taking up your duties, like the humans who wed king to priestess to show devotion to a goddess.\"",
      "The decrepit old woman snorted in derision.",
      "\"You've seen what happens when men rule things.",
      "Zeus's father and grandfather were tyrants.",
      "So when the Olympians came to power, we decided to have a few queens instead.",
      "Your mother got stewardship of the earth, you get the underworld, that idiot Hera was supposed to be the Queen of Heaven, but she and Zeus are both convinced that he's in charge.\"",
      "She hawked and spat, as if the royal couple's names had left a foul taste in her mouth.",
      "\"Hades has just been keeping the throne warm for you.",
      "Well, figuratively speaking.",
      "I doubt he could keep much of anything warm.\"",
      "She grinned, her gums black and toothless.",
      "A silence fell as Persephone stood, attempting to take in the crone's words, but it was broken by the girl's soft voice.",
      "\"He came to us, you know.",
      "He knows that neither he nor the underworld are easy to love, and he didn't want to start out wrong with you.",
      "So he came by the same way you did, bloodied and humble, and asked us for answers to your riddles that would please you, though it pains him to leave the underworld for long.",
      "The petitioner's route grants but one answer to one question - he owes us favors for the other two.\"",
      "\"No god likes to owe a debt, least of all him.",
      "I think you should give him a chance.",
      "He's rather cold, and not too good with women, but he has been longing for you.",
      "I know, I made him that way.",
      "Fate is even stronger than Aphrodite, you know.\"",
      "The mother smiled rather dreamily, her grey eyes distant.",
      "The crone shook her head, mouth twisting in distaste at the sentiment in her sister's voice, but did not comment.",
      "Instead, she said, \"You have three choices, girl.\"",
      "\"You can leave the underworld forever, and go back to your mother,\" said the maiden, \"You can marry Hades and take up your crown,\" said the mother, \"Or you can kick the stiff bastard out of your castle and rule alone,\" finished the crone with a sharp cackle.",
      "\"He spoke truly when he told you what your power was, you know.\"",
      "The spinner bent over her wheel, her rich voice almost a murmur.",
      "\"You are rebirth, and because of that, you stand with one foot in death and the other in life.",
      "It is your nature to feel conflicted, but only you can make your choice.\"",
      "Persephone closed her mouth, strangling the request for more advice.",
      "She had asked one question and gotten one answer, best not to press further.",
      "The older the deity, the more capricious they could be, and there was only one goddess in the universe older than the Fates.",
      "Instead, she executed another wobbly curtsy.",
      "\"Thank you, daughters of Night, for your wisdom.\"",
      "The Moirae had already turned back to their work, dismissing her without words, and Persephone turned with slowly-growing horror to look at the treacherous path that had brought her to the cave.",
      "Red flowers bloomed amidst the stones, growing wherever her blood had fallen.",
      "The path looked almost inviting, covered as it was with petals that were almost luminescent in their brightness.",
      "The flowers would only mask the edges and pitfalls of the obsidian, and the stepping stones that had allowed her to cross the Phlegethon were gone entirely.",
      "The fear of the trek back down bore down on her like a weight, nearly driving her again to her knees.",
      "She turned to ask the Fates for passage, and damn the debt, when a soft snort of hot breath stirred the hair over one ear.",
      "Hades's chariot floated in the air, and its master leaned over, his face drawn with the effort of keeping the chariot aloft beyond the boundaries of the underworld.",
      "He extended a hand, and, grateful beyond words, Persephone took it and half-stepped, half-stumbled into the chariot.",
      "She watched him as he snapped the reins and smoothly drew away from the cave, back over the burning river and towards his - her? - stone palace, looming in the distance.",
      "He was not so ugly as she'd once thought.",
      "Gaunt, yes, almost to the point of being skeletal, and bone-pale, but without the heavy beard of his brothers, and with thick, straight black hair that looked almost soft in the half-light.",
      "No doubt feeling her eyes on him, Hades flicked a glance her direction.",
      "\"I sought to keep you from taking that road to save you the pain of it.",
      "I am sorry I did not succeed.\"",
      "Warmth mixed with irritation flooded her, and she wasn't sure which one was stronger, so she just huffed and looked out at the underworld spread out beneath her.",
      "\"It was my choice, though a warning might have been nice.\"",
      "Her statement met with only silence.",
      "His motives might have been admirable, but Persephone had always been willful, always rebellious.",
      "To forbid her from something was the fastest way to drive her to it.",
      "After all, she hadn't started interviewing suitors until her mother had hidden her away from anything vaguely resembling a male.",
      "She sighed, and they passed most of the way to the palace before she spoke again.",
      "\"The ladies, they said I was born to rule here.",
      "And that they gave you the answers to my riddles.\"",
      "Hades stared out at nothing for long enough that Persephone began to wonder if he was just ignoring her, but eventually he spoke.",
      "\"I did not want to have to take you against your will.",
      "If I answered right, then you would come of your own accord, and you would not hate me for bringing you here.\"",
      "\"But you would have taken me anyway, regardless of how I'd reacted to your answers.\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "No hesitation in his voice, nor remorse.",
      "Persephone tilted her head in thought.",
      "\"Why?\"",
      "\"Because you belong here.",
      "Because you were made for me, and I for you.",
      "Because the Fates have decreed it.\"",
      "Persephone sighed and looked down at her hands, the cuts sealed and healing slowly.",
      "The scars would fade in time, where they wouldn't on human hands.",
      "In time, she would have nothing but her memory to tell the tale of her trial.",
      "What would her mother say, if she knew?",
      "She would wail, most likely, and rage and vow vengeance against he who permitted her to injure herself this way.",
      "Demeter would have swooped in and snatched her off the stepping stones of the Phlegethon without a second's thought, for her own good, of course.",
      "Hades, though he sought to keep her from choosing, at least let her go through with her choice once she'd made it.",
      "It was a poor freedom, but better than any that love had ever afforded her.",
      "\"My mother loves me.",
      "Do you love me, Hades?\"",
      "He looked at her, long and searching, until finally, grudgingly, as if he had pulled out his own liver and served it to her on a bed of leafy greens: \"I need you, Persephone.",
      "Is that not enough?\"",
      "She turned away, and would not meet his eyes.",
      "Only the Fates yet knew the answer to that particular riddle.",
      "Persephone knelt in the Asphodel Meadows, digging up a few of the luminous flowers to be transplanted into pots, to brighten up her drafty stone bedroom, and perhaps to take with her when, or if, she returned to the surface.",
      "The ghosts paid her no heed and just drifted along, as if they were unconsciously giving her a wide berth.",
      "Hades was in his castle, holding court, and she had slipped out the back door and made her way alone, if one could ever be alone in a place that was teeming with human souls.",
      "She had just extricated the root system of one of the smaller plants when the flowers to her right rustled and then abruptly stopped.",
      "Persephone glanced up, and found herself eye-to-eye with the shade of a small girl, who was staring at her with slightly vacant eyes.",
      "The girl said nothing, but that was more acknowledgement of the goddess's presence than she had previously received, and to be honest, she craved female companionship.",
      "Persephone smiled in a way that she hoped was reassuring, and lifted a hand in a wave.",
      "\"Hello there.\"",
      "\"Hello.\"",
      "Her voice was wispy, and her face was still expressionless, but Persephone was heartened by the response.",
      "\"What's your name, little one?\"",
      "The girl just blinked.",
      "\"Name?\"",
      "\"Yes.",
      "What are you called?\"",
      "A brief flicker of confusion passed over her face, and then disappeared into emptiness again.",
      "\"I am called nothing.",
      "No one calls me.\"",
      "The girl turned her head and wandered off, her steps light but aimless.",
      "Persephone had known that the souls in the Asphodel Meadows had drank of the river Lethe, which induces them to forget their lives, but she had not known that it stripped from them even their names.",
      "The girl in front of her was empty, and she would wander the meadow until the end of time, without even the memories of her short life to occupy her.",
      "This was what passed for peace in Hades.",
      "This was the best that those who were not blessed by a god would ever achieve after their death.",
      "Persephone finished embedding the asphodel she had uprooted into the pot as she thought.",
      "She had been selfish, thinking only of her own place in the world.",
      "The deathless gods rarely gave more than a passing thought to the mortals who worshipped them, and never at all after they were dead.",
      "It seemed cruel to have created these people in the image of the gods, but then doom them to brief lives that give way to nothing but darkness.",
      "\"Through you, death is no prison.\"",
      "Hades's words had caught her attention first for the power they held, but Persephone was beginning to see the deeper layers beneath.",
      "Her parents would tell her that it was the right of an Olympian to put her own wishes above that of humanity.",
      "This was her chance to be different from her family, to set herself apart from her philandering father and brothers, her jealous aunt and sisters.",
      "It was just one more choice to make.",
      "Persephone sighed and picked up her potted asphodel, heading back towards the castle.",
      "Her entire future had narrowed down to a single hard choice that nothing in her life had ever prepared her to make.",
      "Eventually, news spread in the underworld, from the newly deceased all the way up to Hades himself, of a great famine that was sweeping the Earth.",
      "Crops withered in the fields, no matter how much care they were tended with.",
      "More souls than ever before crowded the banks of the Acheron, waiting to be ferried across, all while wailing of the cruelty of the Lady of Grain.",
      "She would permit nothing to grow until her daughter was returned to her.",
      "Persephone had known that her mother would be furious with her for leaving, likely inconsolable, but to abandon her duties, to sentence countless mortals to death?",
      "Persephone didn't know whether it was rage, grief, or spite that fueled her mother's actions, but it was as if she had gone completely mad.",
      "Hades seemed unsurprised.",
      "\"The humans fear the power of the gods - Zeus's lightning, Poseidon's earthquakes, the very mention of my name - but it is the goddesses that they should truly fear, for their wrath is slow, but utterly without mercy.",
      "A dead race pays no tribute; I should expect Hermes to come and take you from here soon, once Zeus has gotten over his pride and acquiesced to Demeter's demands.\"",
      "The flower goddess took a deep breath.",
      "\"And if I chose to stay?\" Emotion flashed, almost too quickly to catch, across the death god's face.",
      "\"Is that what you desire?\"",
      "Heavy red hair fell around Persephone's face as she stared at the stone beneath her feet.",
      "Her hair was darker than it had been when she left the sunlit lands, and her freckles had all but faded entirely, leaving her skin the color of flawless ivory.",
      "She looked like an entirely different goddess, and felt like one, as well.",
      "There was a large part of her that yearned for flowers and the companionship of her mother and maiden sisters, but there was another that looked at the underworld and saw beauty, possibility, and a kind of freedom that she'd never known - the freedom that comes from power and responsibility, rather than the lack of obligations.",
      "She looked back up into Hades's grey eyes, and saw yearning there, and hope.",
      "If she closed her eyes, she could see her mother's anguish - her overbearing, overprotective, beautiful, wonderful mother, whom she couldn't bear the thought of never seeing again.",
      "\"I don't know.\"",
      "Hades said nothing, just turned and walked into his dining room.",
      "Curious, and a little guilty for being unable to answer him how he wished, Persephone followed.",
      "On the stone table, amidst the golden apples, nectar, and ambrosia, lay a single pomegranate, sliced neatly in half.",
      "Hades offered one of the halves to her.",
      "\"No one, whether mortal or god, can escape the clutches of the underworld once they have tasted of its fruit.",
      "Zeus and Demeter could not keep you from this place, but neither could your own desire.\"",
      "Persephone took the proffered fruit and cradled it delicately in her palms.",
      "\"But I would be permitted to leave?",
      "And how often would I have to return?\"",
      "\"A few months out of every year, at the least - more, if you so chose.\"",
      "\"And if I did not return of my own accord?\" Hades grinned, black and horrific, as he had when he had first stolen his potential bride.",
      "It did not frighten her, though she felt it should have.",
      "\"You would return to me, whether by your choice or by your death, transitory as that is for an Olympian.\"",
      "\"Would it be death that snatched me back, my lord, or would it be you?\"",
      "The dead god raised his eyebrows.",
      "\"Is there a difference?\"",
      "\"There is to me.\"",
      "And it was true.",
      "She did not love him, but there was a piece of her that was intrigued by him, who had looked at a goddess who had been permitted no responsibilities or purpose in life, and had seen a woman who would command even death.",
      "He was solemn again, as he almost always was, and placed a hand against his chest.",
      "\"Then I promise, Persephone, that if anything tries to keep you from me, I will come for you myself.\"",
      "Without any further hesitation, Persephone dug her fingers into the pomegranate and pulled them out, bloody and glistening.",
      "The red flesh disappeared between her red lips and wrote her fate in crimson, binding herself to the land of the dead.",
      "The half-eaten fruit tumbled out of her hand, and Persephone pressed her mouth to Hades's own, the headiness of the pomegranate melding with the taste of bone and ash.",
      "Wordless and intent, she urged him down to the floor, crowning herself queen with pomegranate juice and a broken maidenhead.",
      "Torchlight cast strange, flickering shadows on the walls of the throne room where the queen of the underworld and her consort held court, seated in two immense stone thrones of equal height.",
      "The sea of petitioning dead parted to make way for the torchbearer, a veiled maiden with black hair.",
      "Hades regarded the interloper with his usual stony-faced stoicism, but Persephone leaned forward in curiosity.",
      "The woman was less ephemeral than the spirits surrounding her, and the shadows around her seemed to suggest two other female figures, also holding torches, facing to the side and away.",
      "She was three-in-one, with a hound pacing calmly at her feet.",
      "The king of the dead finally inclined his head in respect, and acknowledged her.",
      "\"Hecate.",
      "What brings you to my threshold?\"",
      "The triple goddess smiled, and her three voices held at once amusement, derision, and gravity.",
      "\"Oh, I believe you already know the answer to that, great Aidoneus.",
      "Demeter rages and weeps for her daughter's absence, and has entreated me to return her, whole and unmolested.\"",
      "She narrowed her eyes and leveled a look at Persephone, taking in the crown and heavy dress of a queen, not a captured maiden.",
      "\"I see that I am too late for that.\"",
      "Persephone simply spread her hands in a helpless gesture.",
      "\"What has been done has been done, and it was by my own choice, and no fault of anyone else.",
      "How long have I been gone from the upper world?\"",
      "\"Half a year, my lady.",
      "Zeus is beginning to buckle under the pressure of Demeter and the mortals, and it is said that he will send Hermes to retrieve you any day now.",
      "I thought that perhaps you would prefer that I guide you.",
      "Considering how your refusal of him made him the laughingstock of Olympus, I doubt he would treat you gently.\"",
      "The queen of the dead inclined her head and rose to her feet.",
      "\"Very well.",
      "I will go with you.",
      "To be honest, my heart longs to see my mother and half-sisters again.",
      "And in half a year's time, you will escort me back here to my husband.\"",
      "Hecate hesitated, two of her voices murmuring in surprise.",
      "\"Your mother will not be pleased with that, and even the lady of the crossroads must fear the Corn-Mother's rage.\"",
      "Persephone waved a hand towards the sapling that grew between her throne and Hades's, planted with the seeds of the pomegranate that had bound her to him.",
      "\"I'm afraid there's nothing anyone can do about it.\"",
      "With a small bow, Hecate walked to the entrance of the great room and held up her torch, lighting the way.",
      "Before Persephone could follow her, however, Hades rose from his throne and caught her hand in his.",
      "\"You will come back.\"",
      "He said it like a statement, but there was a question lurking beneath the surface, an irrational uncertainty about whether she would break a promise bound in blood.",
      "She smiled, a brief flash of fondness blooming in her heart, and pressed a hand to his cheek.",
      "\"Of course.",
      "And if I don't, you'll come and fetch me.\"",
      "With a light, lingering kiss and a smile, she slipped out of his grasp and out of his realm, leaving the underworld somehow more cold and dead than before she'd arrived.",
      "The sun was brighter than Persephone had remembered, the sky a more dazzling shade of blue.",
      "These were the only beauties she found when she emerged from the darkness, however - the land, as far as she could see, was barren and desolate.",
      "Trees clawed the sky with skeletal branches, and dry flower petals crunched under her bare feet.",
      "A small semi-circle of people stood a small distance away.",
      "In the center was a hunched old woman whom Persephone only barely recognized as her mother, with silver liberally threading her wheat-blonde hair.",
      "Directly behind her stood an enormous, bearded man, who spoke with a voice like thunder, \"Well, Demeter?",
      "Are you pleased?",
      "Will you lift this thrice-damned curse now that you have you precious daughter back?\" Demeter straightened a little, casting a venomous glance back at her once-husband.",
      "\"I would have been pleased that you had not sold her off like cattle to our elder brother in the first place.",
      "I have not forgiven you - you are merely rectifying your mistake by returning her to me.\"",
      "Appearing to give him no further thought, the earth-mother walked across the small field to where her daughter stood, small green shoots pushing themselves out of the ground around her feet.",
      "\"Though it would appear that she is not to remain with me, is she?\" Persephone reached over and cradled her mother's wrinkled cheeks in her hands, watching silently as the skin tightened and the silver in her hair gave way to gold.",
      "\"No, mother.",
      "My place is in the underworld.",
      "It always has been.",
      "I'm needed there.",
      "I have power there.",
      "We made a deal, though - half the year below, and half above.",
      "One foot in the grave, and the other in the meadow.\"",
      "Demeter drew her daughter to her in a fierce embrace, then stepped back, clearly unsure whether to feel grateful or betrayed.",
      "After a moment of staring in consternation, she threw up her hands and turned back to the assembled Olympians.",
      "\"So be it!",
      "As long as Persephone walks the soil of the sunlit lands, I will permit things to grow.",
      "When she leaves the mortal world, so will life.\"",
      "Turning back to her daughter, she shook her head anxiously.",
      "\"I would have kept you safe, forever innocent of the horrors of death and the cruelties of men, free from the demands of gods and mortals.\"",
      "The lady of spring just smiled faintly.",
      "\"I know.",
      "But that innocence came at a price that I wasn't willing to pay anymore.",
      "In protecting me, you denied me purpose and fulfillment, denied me the potential to be anything but a silly little girl who spent her days picking flowers.",
      "Your experiences are not my own -- not all husbands are cruel, death holds more joy for me than horror, and there is no true escape from the demands of gods or men.",
      "I know you feared that I would fall victim to the same empty promises that you did, but I chose this.",
      "In doing so, I became not merely a vessel for life, but the life that follows death.\"",
      "She indicated the slowly blossoming meadow, an expanding circle of greenery with herself at its heart.",
      "\"Very well.",
      "When you are done with this lot,\" she waved a hand at the restless gods behind her, \"come find me.",
      "There's work to be done, and you will help me with it.\"",
      "Persephone watched her mother walk away, beauty restored but shoulders slumped with loss.",
      "She raised her own chin and walked towards the rest of her family, greeting them without the obeisance she would have given before her time in the underworld.",
      "She was the goddess of spring and rebirth, the daughter of the earth.",
      "Even among the living and the deathless gods, she was still the queen of Hades."

    "text": "\"You cannot remove these woodland quests, only mutate the labyrinth.\" --\"What the Woods Mean\" by Nin Harris I was born in the shadow of the Labyrinth a week after Daedalus finished its construction. My first memories, fragmented like broken glass, are of its imposing walls. I remember that the dark marble seemed to swallow the light around it. Even when I was in my father's house and away from the Labyrinth I could still feel the hum of its electric boundaries in my bones. They say that when Daedalus, last of the great Earth-born architects, built the Labyrinth, he built it so none could escape. I know this to be a lie, for did I not travel its twist and turns with my half-brother every night and return to my bedchambers every dawn? My brother had many names. Our enemies the Athenians called him Minotaurus the monster. My father called him a tool to be used. My mother is long dead, but when she lived, she called him her punishment. I, along with my other brothers and sisters, called him Asterion. -Fragment 1 recovered from the memory banks of the spacecraft Semele When I am eight, the second set of tributes arrives on Crete. After a night of feasting, Father sends the fourteen tributes into the maze. For a week, the Labyrinth is silent. Xenodice crawls into bed with me at night. Curled up against my side, she whispers that maybe this time Father won't have his way. Maybe this time Asterion won't hurt anyone. Maybe this time our brother will befriend the tributes rather than devour them. On the seventh night, the screams begin. Xenodice buries her face in my neck and weeps. My bed shakes with her sobs for hours until she finally cries herself to sleep. The screams stop shortly after midnight. I untangle myself from Xenodice's grasp and creep out my window to seek Asterion. I use the special ball of string Icarus gave me to make my way through the maze. The thread is made of daedalusium and impossible to cut. Icarus had pressed it upon me shortly before he and his father had fled-- a final gift from a brother in spirit if not in blood, for he alone knew how often I climbed onto the outermost walls of the Labyrinth to speak with Asterion. At first I can only hear the sound of my own unsteady breathing as I turn first one corner, then another, growing steadily close to the center of the maze, but gradually I make out a quiet sobbing sound. The sobs morph into a keening wail as I draw closer, a howl that makes the ground tremble beneath my feet. I head towards the sound of my brother weeping. When I reach him, the full moons hide nothing. It reveals the gore matting his mane and coating his horns, exposes all the bloodied remains and pieces of bones scattered upon the ground. I breathe through my mouth, trying not to smell anything, and keep my gaze focused on Asterion's face which is twisted with a half-dozen emotions. I am glad that I haven't brought Xenodice along. She would have started crying and made things worse. He turns and sees me. His ears droop, his broad shoulders slumping as his expression settles upon despair. \"I wanted them to be my friends,\" he says mournfully. The moonlight glints off of his bloodied fists as he clenches them. He stares down at the bones scattered at his feet. Bitter resentment colors his voice. \"They wouldn't be my friends, Ariadne. I warned them that if they weren't my friends, they were my meals, but they didn't listen--\" I interrupt. \"Xenodice says that you might make friends if you didn't eat the ones who say no,\" I tell him. \"And that next time you should let me help the tributes escape. You know the rules Father--\" I stop as Asterion's ears flatten against his head and his eyes glow red. \"Enough, Ariadne,\" he snarls, fur bristling. Then he stops. Slowly his fur resettles against his hide. \"Xenodice doesn't understand,\" he says. The words rumble in his chest, come out as a warning growl that silences the words that rush to my lips. \"None of them liked me. They were cruel. They called me a monster.\" His voice cracks on the final word. I step carefully over the bones until he is at last within arm's reach. It takes a moment to find a spot on his shoulder that isn't covered in blood, but finally I spot an unblemished spot. I place my hand there, stroking the thick curls. Slowly his shoulders lose their tension. \"I wanted friends,\" he whispers, back to being mournful. \"I am your friend,\" I say. \"Xenodice is your friend.\" \"You're my sisters,\" Asterion counters. I wrinkle my nose at that, and immediately regret the gesture. The air is foul, stinking of death and blood and other terrible things that I don't want to think about. My stomach roils, and it takes a second for me to get it under control. \"Can't we be both?\" I say at last. He huffs out a sound that could be laughter or maybe another frustrated growl. His shoulder twitches against my hand as he lets out a slow breath. \"I am going to bathe,\" he says. He turns towards me, strokes my hair back from my face and smiles. It's a tender gesture; I ignore the blood now coating my hair, the foulness of his breath as he murmurs, \"Goodnight, Ariadne.\" \"Goodnight, Asterion,\" I say. When I crawl back into bed, the ball of daedalusium string safely hidden away, Xenodice stirs. \"Is he--?\" She trails off, her breath catching in her throat in another hiccupping sob. I don't answer immediately, choosing my words carefully. Of our siblings, Xenodice and Glaucus are closest in age to Asterion. They played with him until Asterion began to grow and grow, until his moods turned unpredictable and Father shut him away in the Labyrinth. \"He is sad,\" I say. I frown into the darkness of my bedchambers, remembering his flattened ears and his expression of despair, the way his voice broke at the word monster. \"He needs to leave the Labyrinth. He needs to leave Crete.\" \"Father will never allow that,\" Xenodice whispers. Unsaid was that Father would never let any of us leave, not after Androgeus's death on Athens, but the words thickened the air between us. \"We must figure out a way,\" I say. \"Oh, Ariadne,\" Xenodice sighs, and pulls me back into her arms. She kisses my forehead with cool lips, wrinkles her nose at the streak of blood in my hair but doesn't comment. She says nothing more, and I know she doesn't believe we can do it. I stare into the darkness, towards the window. If I raise my head a little, I'll be able to see the Labyrinth's walls. Next to me, Xenodice's breathing slowly evens out and turns to quiet snoring. \"I will get him out of the Labyrinth,\" I vow with a child's conviction, the promise breathed into my sleeping sister's hair. \"Asterion will be free.\" \"Do we have to be here?\" Phaedra whispers to me as the third set of tributes file into Father's banquet hall. She smoothes the front of her dress before she steps closer to me. We are all arranged around our father's throne, as much on display as the tributes themselves. Phaedra's gaze darts briefly to the tributes, then away. \"I don't want to see their faces, not when I know Asterion is going eat them.\" \"Asterion won't hurt them,\" I hiss back in rebuke. I resist the urge to pinch her for good measure. Phaedra's face reddens with shame. I am glad that Glaucus and Xenodice are standing on the other side of our father and can't hear Phaedra's thoughtless words. Even if she is probably right, a quiet voice in the back of my mind whispers. Asterion's gentleness has increasingly given way to temper more often than not as his years in the maze have stretched on. \"Besides, you know as well as I that we have to be here.\" \"Yes,\" Phaedra sighs. Her voice wobbles dangerously. At thirteen, she has not learned how to hide her emotions as well as the rest of us. Tears glimmer unshed in her eyes as she whispers fiercely, \"But I hate it.\" The ambassador from Athens looks even more miserable than I remember from the last sacrifice; his voice shakes a little as he begins to introduce the tributes. \"Periboea, daughter of Alcathous and Pyrgo,\" he announces. My gaze is drawn to the girl who steps forward. She is striking. All of the tributes are beautiful, of course, healthy and hale as part of the agreement of the Athenian reparations, but Periboea has such a glow around her that I wonder if she's been genetically altered as well. Perhaps geneticists succeeded with her where they failed with Asterion. Maybe they have finally weeded out the mental instability and various deformities that has always accompanied genetic manipulation in the past. Periboea bows, the sleek black wave of her hair hiding her expression as she murmurs, \"Governor Minos.\" \"Periboea,\" Father says slowly. There is something in his tone that makes my mouth go dry and Catreus look sharply at him. Our father leans forwards, his pale gaze intent on Periboea's downturned head. \"Come closer,\" he demands. She looks up. I am close enough to see the incomprehension in her large dark eyes, the way her mouth has fallen open a little in a silent question. Her skin, so black that it seems almost blue in certain light, is too dark to reveal a blush, but I am certain her face is flushed. \"Governor Minos,\" the ambassador objects weakly, but one harsh stare from Father silences him. \"Come here,\" Father says and gestures for her to stand in front of him. Periboea approaches unwillingly, wariness and reluctance in every slow step she takes. When she moves within reach, she grits her teeth and endures it as Father reaches out and strokes her hair. \"Such a waste,\" he says softly, though the words carry. \"Governor,\" snaps one of the male tributes. Everyone's gaze shifts to him as he strides forward, chin up, shoulders straight, mouth set in a stubborn, furious line. He ignores the guards' weapons directed at him, focuses instead on Father. His words are fierce and unyielding. \"Leave her alone.\" Father looks more amused than anything else at the boy's defiance. He glances at the ambassador, whose expression is gray and despairing. \"And who is this?\" \"Governor Minos,\" says the ambassador, \"may I present Theseus, son of Governor Aegeus of Athens.\" The room is deathly silent. Next to me, Phaedra's eyes are as wide as saucers, her hands clapped to her mouth. Father throws back his head and laughs. I stare at Theseus. He is like something out of the stories Mother used to tell, a comely youth with pale flaxen hair and intelligent blue eyes. He looks every inch a hero as he glares at my father, defiant and unafraid. I drink in the sight of Theseus, seek to memorize all his visible assets and imperfections. His nose is slightly crooked from an old injury. His left canine is chipped as he bares his teeth and continues to glower at Father. Otherwise, his lean, muscular form is perfect. I hide a smile behind my goblet. For the first time in years, I believe I can fulfill my vow. As a final act of cruelty, Father forces the tributes to eat their last meal alongside us in a terrible mockery of a feast. When I was eight, I hated it, kept my gaze fixed upon my food and spoke to no one the entirety of the banquet. I am grateful for it this year. I situate myself next to Theseus and position Phaedra on his other side as a buffer. Father is distracted by poor Periboea, whose beautiful features seem carved of stone and who eats little. At least Catreus sits on her other side, to keep Father from doing anything too terrible. \"That was well done,\" I say to Theseus. He stares at me without recognition for a minute. Then something flickers behind his eyes and his jaw sets. \"Someone had to speak. What else would he have done if I'd not told him to stop?\" Phaedra, whose face is flushed and whose eyes keep darting towards Theseus and then away, almost drops her spoon when he speaks. \"Catreus would have stopped him, I think,\" she whispers. Her face turns even redder when Theseus glances in her direction. Silent, I watch Theseus as he grimly eats his meal and waves off the offers of alcohol by the serving robots. A few minutes later, when Phaedra is distracted by something Glaucus says, I seize my chance and lean into Theseus's space. He smells both typical and foreign, stale sweat and something unfamiliar filling my senses as I whisper into his ear. \"What would you say if I told you I knew a way out of the maze, and that together we could save your people?\" \"I would say I am not certain that I believe you,\" Theseus says, words curt. I nod, unsurprised. I did not expect him to trust me immediately. \"I would expect something in return, of course,\" I say. Interest begins to edge out the mistrust on his face. \"Of course. And what would you want?\" I keep my steady gaze fixed upon his. \"I want you to take me and Asterion with you to Athens.\" Theseus's expression goes blank. \"Asterion?\" \"You call him the Minotaur.\" \"You want--\" Heads turn. Theseus lowers his voice with obvious effort. \"You want me to bring the monster on board my ship?\" I do not allow myself to frown. \"He is my brother. And it is his imprisonment that drove him to his previous actions. If he were free, I swear to you that he would harm no one,\" I say, putting all my conviction into the words. Theseus does not look entirely swayed, but at least he is still listening. I press my case. \"I have a ball of wire made of daedalusium. I will give it to you if you swear to take us with you. You can use it to make your way through the maze and find your way out again. My father will have to let you go.\" Theseus is silent for most of the meal, his expression unreadable. My throat is tight. My heart pounds so loudly in my ears that I wonder that he and Phaedra do not hear it. I pick at my food, appetite gone, as he considers my offer. At last he nods at me and whispers, \"Bring me the daedalusium string before I enter the maze, and I promise I will take you to Athens with me.\" \"Done,\" I say immediately. It takes everything within me not to slump in relief. I lift my drink to my lips, take a long swallow instead, and ignore the way my hand wants to tremble. \"Will you tell me of Athens?\" Phaedra asks him timidly, and I only half-listen as Theseus answers her. I smuggle the ball of thread to Theseus just before dawn. I pace alone in my quarters in the ensuing hours after the tributes march into the Labyrinth. I know that several of my siblings are doing the same in their bedchambers, but that is little comfort. I walk until my leg muscles burn and I am dizzy from the constant back and forth across my room. A great cry reaches my ears mid-afternoon, the word that the tributes are making their way to one of the exits spreading like wildfire. My breath catches in my throat. \"Thank you,\" I whisper as loud cheers spread through the palace. Most in the palace had mourned Androgeus, but very few had approved of the punishment Minos had given the Athenians. Still fewer ever understood Asterion and cared for him. I can hear cries of joy and relief ringing through the halls. My father rages, but there is nothing to be done. Theseus emerges with his bloodstained fist held up in victory. I cannot breathe for a moment, although I know the blood is fake, that Asterion is hidden away and simply waiting for the right moment to steal upon the Athenian ship. The other tributes straggle out after Theseus, wearing varying expressions of relief and strain as Theseus announces, \"I have defeated your monster, governor! We leave tonight...after our farewell feast.\" The feast passes in a blur. Theseus is seated at Father's right hand, the better for my father to glare at him. Phaedra sits next to me once more, swinging between excitedly babbling about Theseus's prowess and bursting into sudden tears for Asterion. My other siblings sit silent and stone-faced throughout the meal. I yearn to take them all aside and tell them the truth, especially Xenodice and Glaucus, who both drink far too much wine and stare in mute, despairing incomprehension at anyone who tries to speak to them. Periboea pauses by my chair, leans against it as she adjusts a strap on her boot. \"We leave at twenty-one hundred,\" she whispers. \"Pack lightly.\" \"Understood,\" I whisper back. I bite down on the edges of a smile that wants to form, hard enough that I taste blood in my mouth and have to wash away the taste with my wine. Phaedra takes hold of my free hand, clasps it so tightly that I can feel the bones grind together. \"It will be okay, Ariadne,\" she says with tears in her eyes. She's mistaken my bitten back smile for a bitten back expression of grief, I realize. I look at her pale, solemn eyes, too old in her young face, and give in to the impulse to kiss her forehead. \"It will be okay,\" she whispers again, and doesn't let go. The Athenian ship is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. It is large and elegant, the white-gold shielding catching the moonlight and making it seem like a mirage that will disappear if I touch it. As I study it, the captain begins to warm up the engines. To my surprise, the engine fires glow black instead of the usual white or blue. I squint at them in bewilderment. \"My father made me promise that if I was victorious, the ambassador would change the engine fires to white. If I failed, he would keep them black,\" Theseus explains. I jump, having been too absorbed in my examination to hear him approach. \"Can't you just announce your survival?\" I ask, curious. Theseus shrugs. \"Since the war, the atmosphere makes communication impossible until we've nearly landed on Athens. My father wants to know if I live as soon as possible, and surveying the color of the ship's vapor trail will do that.\" He leans over, picks up my bag of belongings. \"Is this everything?\" \"Yes,\" I say. There is little I want to take with me. Clothing, a tablet that has all my favorite stories and pictures of my family, a toy Daedalus made for me, some jewelry of my mother's. Theseus hesitates a moment. Then he shrugs. \"Come inside,\" he says, and I follow him up the ramp. The ramp rises and shuts behind me. I look around, surprised that my brother is not here to greet me. \"Asterion!\" I call, ignoring the welcoming smiles the tributes and the ambassador give me. I turn hopefully at the sound of footsteps, but it is only Periboea approaching. \"If we are leaving, surely Asterion can reveal himself,\" I say. The floor rumbles beneath my feet. A second later I sway, caught off-guard by the suddenness of the departure. Surely the engines should have taken longer to warm up. When I regain my footing, I look up to see a puzzled look on Periboea's face. \"Asterion?\" she says, her gaze flickering between me and Theseus. \"The name is unfamiliar to me.\" \"Asterion is my brother,\" I explain. \"He's accompanying us.\" \"No one else came aboard,\" she says. Her expression is troubled. For a moment, the words don't make sense. Then I whirl to glare at Theseus. \"You promised me and my brother safe passage if we helped you! You left him in the maze?\" Theseus's expression is remote. His cool words slide like a knife between my ribs. \"You had to realize I could never allow a monster aboard my ship. He was a man-eater.\" \"But--\" \"I killed the Minotaur.\" Someone is screaming, as loud and as furious a roar as ever escaped Asterion's throat. It takes me a moment to realize the screams are mine, and an even longer moment to realize that I have borne Theseus to the floor, my hands tight around his throat. His hands flutter uncertainly in the air, fingers curled instinctively to gouge out my eyes but never going near my face. He wears a strange look, half-shocked, half-incredulous, as though he never considered I might love my brother. \"Ariadne!\" The girl's voice does not belong to Xenodice or Phaedra, but the desperate edge reminds me of my sisters when they talked Asterion down from one of his rages. I listen. \"Ariadne, release him,\" Periboea says again. \"If you kill him, the captain will kill you, and then Minos will seek revenge. Do you want another war?\" The laugh that escapes my lips is harsh and ugly. Theseus's face turns redder, tears leaking from the corners of his eyes as I snarl, \"My father went to war over Androgeus's murder. Shall I not do the same for Asterion?\" Someone grabs a fistful of my hair and yanks. My hands loosen in surprise, and Theseus rolls out of my reach. I lunge for him, ignoring the pain in my scalp, but he is already gone, guards moving to stand between us. \"Ariadne,\" Periboea says gently. She kneels next to me, her grip still tight on my hair. Pity darkens her eyes, deepens the creases around her mouth. \"I am sorry for your loss, but there has been enough war.\" \"Athens robbed me of two brothers,\" I say. Another scream bubbles up from my throat, but when it escapes, it comes out as a moan of despair. I think of Xenodice and Glaucus and their stricken expressions, of Phaedra's tears, of Theseus's bloodstained hands and triumphant smile. \"Asterion,\" I moan. Did he call out for aid when Theseus killed him? Did he wail for me, for Xenodice, for Mother? \"Asterion.\" Periobea's hand drops from my hair to my shoulder, but I curl in on myself. I huddle over the spot where Theseus's words stabbed me, where it feels as though my heart's blood is spilling from my chest. \"Asterion.\" I wail his name until I have no voice left. Theseus must die, whether it is by my hand or by one of my kin. Periboea might wish for peace, but I am my father's daughter. I shall have vengeance for Asterion. -Fragment 14 recovered from the memory banks of the spacecraft Semele The ship is scheduled to refuel at Naxos, a small space station about halfway between Crete and Athens. However I avenge Asterion, I shall have to accomplish it before then. I wish, as I crawl among the engine wiring and listen for approaching footsteps, that I paid attention to Deucalion when he explained the design of the Argo. Perhaps then I could more easily cause this ship's destruction. The wires cut deeply into my fingers, drawing blood, but I ignore the pain. \"Ariadne.\" Somehow, it does not surprise me that it is Periboea who discovers me, that even on metal floors her footsteps are soundless. Her voice is soft and unsteady with horror. \"Ariadne,\" she whispers again. She presses her hand upon my wrist. For a moment I think she means to try and reason with me once more, then I feel the prick of a needle and numbness spreads up my arm. \"What....\" My thoughts slow, turn sluggish. I blink heavy eyelids. \"Peri....\" My lips feel swollen and I cannot properly shape her name with my mouth. \"You are mad with grief,\" Periboea whispers, fingers still tight around my wrist. \"If they discover what you just tried to do, they will kill you.\" Despite the numbness, I smile at the thought of Theseus's expression. Periboea swears. \"Athenian, Cretan, you are all mad,\" she says, and then her fingernails dig into my skin as she drags me away from the engines. She half-carries, half-drags me through the corridors, explaining my condition away with a quiet, \"Exhausted from grief, I think,\" to anyone who asks. I should be angry at her for thwarting my revenge, I know, but I cannot muster the emotion. Everything seems distant, my vision narrowing to pinpricks. I will be furious later, I think drowsily. She lowers me onto a seat, smoothes my hair away from my face. \"Ariadne,\" she says. I struggle to keep my eyes open, but her face wavers and blurs. \"I have set the escape pod's distress beacon to send out a call after five hours, once we are out of range. If you have any sense, you will not try to follow us.\" If I had any sense, I think, I would have looked past Theseus's looks and seen his callousness. I close my eyes, weary beyond belief. Perhaps Periboea kisses my forehead. Perhaps she simply sighs and steps away to the door of the escape pod. I cannot feel anything at all as I slump forward and welcome the darkness. When I awaken, I do so slowly, my head pounding. Someone holds my hands, turning them so that my palms face upwards. Presumably this is to study my damaged fingertips, which sting in a vague sort of way. I breathe in unsterilized air and realize I am no longer in the escape pod. My stomach roils and I keep my eyes shut for a moment, hoping that I do not vomit on whoever's taken me from the escape pod. \"That looks painful,\" a stranger murmurs as gentle fingers probe at my cuts. His voice is warm with concern and accented with an alien lilt. No Cretan or Athenian, the owner of this voice. \"Mother, do we have any skin and muscle repairing nanites in the infirmary?\" \"Yes,\" a woman answers, but there is something about her monotonous voice that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. A spike of adrenaline banishes the last of the sedative from my system. I force my eyes open and immediately wish I didn't. I'd been a fool before to think that Periboea had been genetically enhanced. She is exceedingly beautiful, but naturally so. The young man who kneels before me is so beautiful that it's painful. My eyes sting at the sight of his perfectly symmetrical features, the impossible purplish-blue of his eyes. I spot the tell-tale glitter of madness in his gaze and my breath catches in my throat. \"You're a god,\" I breathe through still-numb lips, the words only slightly slurred. I do not know who first called enhanced humans gods, but someone did once upon a time and the name stuck. The gods are powerful and unpredictable, their life-spans extending usually twenty years more than most humans, but mental instability goes hand in hand with their terrible beauty and power. \"No,\" the man says with a sardonic quirk of his lips that suggests he makes this correction often. \"My father is. My mother's human.\" He looks up, his smile softening. \"Aren't you, Mother?\" \"Yes,\" a woman answers, and now I realize why her voice unsettles me. The woman's voice comes from all around me, as though she is talking through a speaker. The man catches me staring. His smile turns crooked. \"I'm being rude. My name is Dionysus.\" \"Ariadne,\" I say automatically. \"Ariadne,\" he repeats, and the way he says my name makes me flush and jerk my hands away from his. He doesn't look offended. \"Ariadne, this is my mother, Semele. Mother, this is Ariadne.\" \"Hello, Ariadne,\" the woman says pleasantly as Dionysus gestures into the empty air. \"Well. Let me go get the nanites,\" Dionysus says, getting to his feet. He has laid me out on a bed, presumably his, for the room is small and cluttered with personal items. I spot my bag of belongings at the foot of the bed. Once he is gone, I sit up and blink at my surroundings. \"Um, I am sorry, Semele, but where are you?\" I say at last. \"If I am anywhere, I am situated in the ship's memory banks. I am the ship's artificial intelligence, based on the personality and memories of Dionysus's deceased mother. He persists in the delusion that I am in fact his mother rather than an electronic copy,\" the disembodied voice explains. There is a moment's pause. \"I do not advise trying to disabuse him of the delusion. His cousin Pentheus attempted it a year ago.\" \"What happened to Pentheus?\" I ask, suspecting I already know the answer. I do not think it possible for an A.I.'s voice to turn cold, but this one's does. \"He is deceased.\" Dionysus returns, bearing a medical supply box. The nanites quickly go to work on my fingertips, stitching together skin and speeding along the healing process. My fingers tingle and itch. I am almost grateful for the distraction when Dionysus asks, \"So how did you come to be in an escape pod with injured hands?\" For a moment I struggle to come up with a feasible lie, then I shrug. \"I was trying to sabotage a ship,\" I say. Dionysus's mouth twitches, though I cannot tell whether he is fighting a smile or a frown. I find that I cannot bring myself to care. At least my eyes have adjusted somewhat to his unnatural beauty. \"Did you succeed?\" he asks. \"No.\" \"I am sorry,\" he says, actually sounding as though he means it. I find myself laughing, the sound edged with hysteria for a moment before it smoothes out into something more genuine. \"So am I,\" I say. I look towards the window where the stars seem smeared across the glass. \"Where are we going?\" Dionysus's reflection shrugs. \"Nowhere in particular,\" he says. \"Did you have a preference?\" \"Not Crete or Athens,\" I say. I cannot face my family, and I would be arrested as soon as I set foot on Athenian soil. I frown. \"You can drop me off at Naxos. I have no money--\" \"Mother likes you,\" Dionysus says, as though that means something. Perhaps to him it does. He smiles at me, and it's a half-wild, half-earnest look. \"You can stay on board as long as you like.\" He pauses. \"I could teach you how to properly sabotage a ship.\" Despite everything, my lips twitch into a weak smile. \"I think I would like that.\" Dionysus stuns me with his delighted grin that somehow intensifies his looks even more, his eyes sparkling with excitement. \"Wonderful! Mother, set the ship on autopilot. I'm going to show Ariadne how to make the engines blow up.\" \"Have fun, dear,\" the A.I. says. \"Welcome aboard, Ariadne.\" \"Thank you, Semele,\" I say, and let Dionysus lead the way.",

      "Bitter resentment colors his voice.",
      "\"They wouldn't be my friends, Ariadne.",
      "I warned them that if they weren't my friends, they were my meals, but they didn't listen--\" I interrupt.",
      "\"Xenodice says that you might make friends if you didn't eat the ones who say no,\" I tell him.",
      "\"And that next time you should let me help the tributes escape.",
      "You know the rules Father--\" I stop as Asterion's ears flatten against his head and his eyes glow red.",
      "\"Enough, Ariadne,\" he snarls, fur bristling.",
      "Then he stops.",
      "Slowly his fur resettles against his hide.",
      "\"Xenodice doesn't understand,\" he says.",
      "The words rumble in his chest, come out as a warning growl that silences the words that rush to my lips.",
      "\"None of them liked me.",
      "They were cruel.",
      "They called me a monster.\"",
      "His voice cracks on the final word.",
      "I step carefully over the bones until he is at last within arm's reach.",
      "It takes a moment to find a spot on his shoulder that isn't covered in blood, but finally I spot an unblemished spot.",
      "I place my hand there, stroking the thick curls.",
      "Slowly his shoulders lose their tension.",
      "\"I wanted friends,\" he whispers, back to being mournful.",
      "\"I am your friend,\" I say.",
      "\"Xenodice is your friend.\"",
      "\"You're my sisters,\" Asterion counters.",
      "I wrinkle my nose at that, and immediately regret the gesture.",
      "The air is foul, stinking of death and blood and other terrible things that I don't want to think about.",
      "My stomach roils, and it takes a second for me to get it under control.",
      "\"Can't we be both?\" I say at last.",
      "He huffs out a sound that could be laughter or maybe another frustrated growl.",
      "His shoulder twitches against my hand as he lets out a slow breath.",
      "\"I am going to bathe,\" he says.",
      "He turns towards me, strokes my hair back from my face and smiles.",
      "It's a tender gesture; I ignore the blood now coating my hair, the foulness of his breath as he murmurs, \"Goodnight, Ariadne.\"",
      "\"Goodnight, Asterion,\" I say.",
      "When I crawl back into bed, the ball of daedalusium string safely hidden away, Xenodice stirs.",
      "\"Is he--?\"",
      "She trails off, her breath catching in her throat in another hiccupping sob.",
      "I don't answer immediately, choosing my words carefully.",
      "Of our siblings, Xenodice and Glaucus are closest in age to Asterion.",
      "They played with him until Asterion began to grow and grow, until his moods turned unpredictable and Father shut him away in the Labyrinth.",
      "\"He is sad,\" I say.",
      "I frown into the darkness of my bedchambers, remembering his flattened ears and his expression of despair, the way his voice broke at the word monster.",
      "\"He needs to leave the Labyrinth.",
      "He needs to leave Crete.\"",
      "\"Father will never allow that,\" Xenodice whispers.",
      "Unsaid was that Father would never let any of us leave, not after Androgeus's death on Athens, but the words thickened the air between us.",
      "\"We must figure out a way,\" I say.",
      "\"Oh, Ariadne,\" Xenodice sighs, and pulls me back into her arms.",
      "She kisses my forehead with cool lips, wrinkles her nose at the streak of blood in my hair but doesn't comment.",
      "She says nothing more, and I know she doesn't believe we can do it.",
      "I stare into the darkness, towards the window.",
      "If I raise my head a little, I'll be able to see the Labyrinth's walls.",
      "Next to me, Xenodice's breathing slowly evens out and turns to quiet snoring.",
      "\"I will get him out of the Labyrinth,\" I vow with a child's conviction, the promise breathed into my sleeping sister's hair.",
      "\"Asterion will be free.\"",
      "\"Do we have to be here?\" Phaedra whispers to me as the third set of tributes file into Father's banquet hall.",
      "She smoothes the front of her dress before she steps closer to me.",
      "We are all arranged around our father's throne, as much on display as the tributes themselves.",
      "Phaedra's gaze darts briefly to the tributes, then away.",
      "\"I don't want to see their faces, not when I know Asterion is going eat them.\"",
      "\"Asterion won't hurt them,\" I hiss back in rebuke.",
      "I resist the urge to pinch her for good measure.",
      "Phaedra's face reddens with shame.",
      "I am glad that Glaucus and Xenodice are standing on the other side of our father and can't hear Phaedra's thoughtless words.",
      "Even if she is probably right, a quiet voice in the back of my mind whispers.",
      "Asterion's gentleness has increasingly given way to temper more often than not as his years in the maze have stretched on.",
      "\"Besides, you know as well as I that we have to be here.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Phaedra sighs.",
      "Her voice wobbles dangerously.",
      "At thirteen, she has not learned how to hide her emotions as well as the rest of us.",
      "Tears glimmer unshed in her eyes as she whispers fiercely, \"But I hate it.\"",
      "The ambassador from Athens looks even more miserable than I remember from the last sacrifice; his voice shakes a little as he begins to introduce the tributes.",
      "\"Periboea, daughter of Alcathous and Pyrgo,\" he announces.",
      "My gaze is drawn to the girl who steps forward.",
      "She is striking.",
      "All of the tributes are beautiful, of course, healthy and hale as part of the agreement of the Athenian reparations, but Periboea has such a glow around her that I wonder if she's been genetically altered as well.",
      "Perhaps geneticists succeeded with her where they failed with Asterion.",
      "Maybe they have finally weeded out the mental instability and various deformities that has always accompanied genetic manipulation in the past.",
      "Periboea bows, the sleek black wave of her hair hiding her expression as she murmurs, \"Governor Minos.\"",
      "\"Periboea,\" Father says slowly.",
      "There is something in his tone that makes my mouth go dry and Catreus look sharply at him.",
      "Our father leans forwards, his pale gaze intent on Periboea's downturned head.",
      "\"Come closer,\" he demands.",
      "She looks up.",
      "I am close enough to see the incomprehension in her large dark eyes, the way her mouth has fallen open a little in a silent question.",
      "Her skin, so black that it seems almost blue in certain light, is too dark to reveal a blush, but I am certain her face is flushed.",
      "\"Governor Minos,\" the ambassador objects weakly, but one harsh stare from Father silences him.",
      "\"Come here,\" Father says and gestures for her to stand in front of him.",
      "Periboea approaches unwillingly, wariness and reluctance in every slow step she takes.",
      "When she moves within reach, she grits her teeth and endures it as Father reaches out and strokes her hair.",
      "\"Such a waste,\" he says softly, though the words carry.",
      "\"Governor,\" snaps one of the male tributes.",
      "Everyone's gaze shifts to him as he strides forward, chin up, shoulders straight, mouth set in a stubborn, furious line.",
      "He ignores the guards' weapons directed at him, focuses instead on Father.",
      "His words are fierce and unyielding.",
      "\"Leave her alone.\"",
      "Father looks more amused than anything else at the boy's defiance.",
      "He glances at the ambassador, whose expression is gray and despairing.",
      "\"And who is this?\" \"Governor Minos,\" says the ambassador, \"may I present Theseus, son of Governor Aegeus of Athens.\"",
      "The room is deathly silent.",
      "Next to me, Phaedra's eyes are as wide as saucers, her hands clapped to her mouth.",
      "Father throws back his head and laughs.",
      "I stare at Theseus.",
      "He is like something out of the stories Mother used to tell, a comely youth with pale flaxen hair and intelligent blue eyes.",
      "He looks every inch a hero as he glares at my father, defiant and unafraid.",
      "I drink in the sight of Theseus, seek to memorize all his visible assets and imperfections.",
      "His nose is slightly crooked from an old injury.",
      "His left canine is chipped as he bares his teeth and continues to glower at Father.",
      "Otherwise, his lean, muscular form is perfect.",
      "I hide a smile behind my goblet.",
      "For the first time in years, I believe I can fulfill my vow.",
      "As a final act of cruelty, Father forces the tributes to eat their last meal alongside us in a terrible mockery of a feast.",
      "When I was eight, I hated it, kept my gaze fixed upon my food and spoke to no one the entirety of the banquet.",
      "I am grateful for it this year.",
      "I situate myself next to Theseus and position Phaedra on his other side as a buffer.",
      "Father is distracted by poor Periboea, whose beautiful features seem carved of stone and who eats little.",
      "At least Catreus sits on her other side, to keep Father from doing anything too terrible.",
      "\"That was well done,\" I say to Theseus.",
      "He stares at me without recognition for a minute.",
      "Then something flickers behind his eyes and his jaw sets.",
      "\"Someone had to speak.",
      "What else would he have done if I'd not told him to stop?\" Phaedra, whose face is flushed and whose eyes keep darting towards Theseus and then away, almost drops her spoon when he speaks.",
      "\"Catreus would have stopped him, I think,\" she whispers.",
      "Her face turns even redder when Theseus glances in her direction.",
      "Silent, I watch Theseus as he grimly eats his meal and waves off the offers of alcohol by the serving robots.",
      "A few minutes later, when Phaedra is distracted by something Glaucus says, I seize my chance and lean into Theseus's space.",
      "He smells both typical and foreign, stale sweat and something unfamiliar filling my senses as I whisper into his ear.",
      "\"What would you say if I told you I knew a way out of the maze, and that together we could save your people?\"",
      "\"I would say I am not certain that I believe you,\" Theseus says, words curt.",
      "I nod, unsurprised.",
      "I did not expect him to trust me immediately.",
      "\"I would expect something in return, of course,\" I say.",
      "Interest begins to edge out the mistrust on his face.",
      "\"Of course.",
      "And what would you want?\" I keep my steady gaze fixed upon his.",
      "\"I want you to take me and Asterion with you to Athens.\"",
      "Theseus's expression goes blank.",
      "\"Asterion?\"",
      "\"You call him the Minotaur.\"",
      "\"You want--\" Heads turn.",
      "Theseus lowers his voice with obvious effort.",
      "\"You want me to bring the monster on board my ship?\" I do not allow myself to frown.",
      "\"He is my brother.",
      "And it is his imprisonment that drove him to his previous actions.",
      "If he were free, I swear to you that he would harm no one,\" I say, putting all my conviction into the words.",
      "Theseus does not look entirely swayed, but at least he is still listening.",
      "I press my case.",
      "\"I have a ball of wire made of daedalusium.",
      "I will give it to you if you swear to take us with you.",
      "You can use it to make your way through the maze and find your way out again.",
      "My father will have to let you go.\"",
      "Theseus is silent for most of the meal, his expression unreadable.",
      "My throat is tight.",
      "My heart pounds so loudly in my ears that I wonder that he and Phaedra do not hear it.",
      "I pick at my food, appetite gone, as he considers my offer.",
      "At last he nods at me and whispers, \"Bring me the daedalusium string before I enter the maze, and I promise I will take you to Athens with me.\"",
      "\"Done,\" I say immediately.",
      "It takes everything within me not to slump in relief.",
      "I lift my drink to my lips, take a long swallow instead, and ignore the way my hand wants to tremble.",
      "\"Will you tell me of Athens?\" Phaedra asks him timidly, and I only half-listen as Theseus answers her.",
      "I smuggle the ball of thread to Theseus just before dawn.",
      "I pace alone in my quarters in the ensuing hours after the tributes march into the Labyrinth.",
      "I know that several of my siblings are doing the same in their bedchambers, but that is little comfort.",
      "I walk until my leg muscles burn and I am dizzy from the constant back and forth across my room.",
      "A great cry reaches my ears mid-afternoon, the word that the tributes are making their way to one of the exits spreading like wildfire.",
      "My breath catches in my throat.",
      "\"Thank you,\" I whisper as loud cheers spread through the palace.",
      "Most in the palace had mourned Androgeus, but very few had approved of the punishment Minos had given the Athenians.",
      "Still fewer ever understood Asterion and cared for him.",
      "I can hear cries of joy and relief ringing through the halls.",
      "My father rages, but there is nothing to be done.",
      "Theseus emerges with his bloodstained fist held up in victory.",
      "I cannot breathe for a moment, although I know the blood is fake, that Asterion is hidden away and simply waiting for the right moment to steal upon the Athenian ship.",
      "The other tributes straggle out after Theseus, wearing varying expressions of relief and strain as Theseus announces, \"I have defeated your monster, governor!",
      "We leave tonight...after our farewell feast.\"",
      "The feast passes in a blur.",
      "Theseus is seated at Father's right hand, the better for my father to glare at him.",
      "Phaedra sits next to me once more, swinging between excitedly babbling about Theseus's prowess and bursting into sudden tears for Asterion.",
      "My other siblings sit silent and stone-faced throughout the meal.",
      "I yearn to take them all aside and tell them the truth, especially Xenodice and Glaucus, who both drink far too much wine and stare in mute, despairing incomprehension at anyone who tries to speak to them.",
      "Periboea pauses by my chair, leans against it as she adjusts a strap on her boot.",
      "\"We leave at twenty-one hundred,\" she whispers.",
      "\"Pack lightly.\"",
      "\"Understood,\" I whisper back.",
      "I bite down on the edges of a smile that wants to form, hard enough that I taste blood in my mouth and have to wash away the taste with my wine.",
      "Phaedra takes hold of my free hand, clasps it so tightly that I can feel the bones grind together.",
      "\"It will be okay, Ariadne,\" she says with tears in her eyes.",
      "She's mistaken my bitten back smile for a bitten back expression of grief, I realize.",
      "I look at her pale, solemn eyes, too old in her young face, and give in to the impulse to kiss her forehead.",
      "\"It will be okay,\" she whispers again, and doesn't let go.",
      "The Athenian ship is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.",
      "It is large and elegant, the white-gold shielding catching the moonlight and making it seem like a mirage that will disappear if I touch it.",
      "As I study it, the captain begins to warm up the engines.",
      "To my surprise, the engine fires glow black instead of the usual white or blue.",
      "I squint at them in bewilderment.",
      "\"My father made me promise that if I was victorious, the ambassador would change the engine fires to white.",
      "If I failed, he would keep them black,\" Theseus explains.",
      "I jump, having been too absorbed in my examination to hear him approach.",
      "\"Can't you just announce your survival?\" I ask, curious.",
      "Theseus shrugs.",
      "\"Since the war, the atmosphere makes communication impossible until we've nearly landed on Athens.",
      "My father wants to know if I live as soon as possible, and surveying the color of the ship's vapor trail will do that.\"",
      "He leans over, picks up my bag of belongings.",
      "\"Is this everything?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" I say.",
      "There is little I want to take with me.",
      "Clothing, a tablet that has all my favorite stories and pictures of my family, a toy Daedalus made for me, some jewelry of my mother's.",
      "Theseus hesitates a moment.",
      "Then he shrugs.",
      "\"Come inside,\" he says, and I follow him up the ramp.",
      "The ramp rises and shuts behind me.",
      "I look around, surprised that my brother is not here to greet me.",
      "\"Asterion!\"",
      "I call, ignoring the welcoming smiles the tributes and the ambassador give me.",
      "I turn hopefully at the sound of footsteps, but it is only Periboea approaching.",
      "\"If we are leaving, surely Asterion can reveal himself,\" I say.",
      "The floor rumbles beneath my feet.",
      "A second later I sway, caught off-guard by the suddenness of the departure.",
      "Surely the engines should have taken longer to warm up.",
      "When I regain my footing, I look up to see a puzzled look on Periboea's face.",
      "\"Asterion?\" she says, her gaze flickering between me and Theseus.",
      "\"The name is unfamiliar to me.\"",
      "\"Asterion is my brother,\" I explain.",
      "\"He's accompanying us.\"",
      "\"No one else came aboard,\" she says.",
      "Her expression is troubled.",
      "For a moment, the words don't make sense.",
      "Then I whirl to glare at Theseus.",
      "\"You promised me and my brother safe passage if we helped you!",
      "You left him in the maze?\"",
      "Theseus's expression is remote.",
      "His cool words slide like a knife between my ribs.",
      "\"You had to realize I could never allow a monster aboard my ship.",
      "He was a man-eater.\"",
      "\"But--\" \"I killed the Minotaur.\"",
      "Someone is screaming, as loud and as furious a roar as ever escaped Asterion's throat.",
      "It takes me a moment to realize the screams are mine, and an even longer moment to realize that I have borne Theseus to the floor, my hands tight around his throat.",
      "His hands flutter uncertainly in the air, fingers curled instinctively to gouge out my eyes but never going near my face.",
      "He wears a strange look, half-shocked, half-incredulous, as though he never considered I might love my brother.",
      "\"Ariadne!\"",
      "The girl's voice does not belong to Xenodice or Phaedra, but the desperate edge reminds me of my sisters when they talked Asterion down from one of his rages.",
      "I listen.",
      "\"Ariadne, release him,\" Periboea says again.",
      "\"If you kill him, the captain will kill you, and then Minos will seek revenge.",
      "Do you want another war?\"",
      "The laugh that escapes my lips is harsh and ugly.",
      "Theseus's face turns redder, tears leaking from the corners of his eyes as I snarl, \"My father went to war over Androgeus's murder.",
      "Shall I not do the same for Asterion?\" Someone grabs a fistful of my hair and yanks.",
      "My hands loosen in surprise, and Theseus rolls out of my reach.",
      "I lunge for him, ignoring the pain in my scalp, but he is already gone, guards moving to stand between us.",
      "\"Ariadne,\" Periboea says gently.",
      "She kneels next to me, her grip still tight on my hair.",
      "Pity darkens her eyes, deepens the creases around her mouth.",
      "\"I am sorry for your loss, but there has been enough war.\"",
      "\"Athens robbed me of two brothers,\" I say.",
      "Another scream bubbles up from my throat, but when it escapes, it comes out as a moan of despair.",
      "I think of Xenodice and Glaucus and their stricken expressions, of Phaedra's tears, of Theseus's bloodstained hands and triumphant smile.",
      "\"Asterion,\" I moan.",
      "Did he call out for aid when Theseus killed him?",
      "Did he wail for me, for Xenodice, for Mother?",
      "\"Asterion.\"",
      "Periobea's hand drops from my hair to my shoulder, but I curl in on myself.",
      "I huddle over the spot where Theseus's words stabbed me, where it feels as though my heart's blood is spilling from my chest.",
      "\"Asterion.\"",
      "I wail his name until I have no voice left.",
      "Theseus must die, whether it is by my hand or by one of my kin.",
      "Periboea might wish for peace, but I am my father's daughter.",
      "I shall have vengeance for Asterion.",
      "-Fragment 14 recovered from the memory banks of the spacecraft Semele The ship is scheduled to refuel at Naxos, a small space station about halfway between Crete and Athens.",
      "However I avenge Asterion, I shall have to accomplish it before then.",
      "I wish, as I crawl among the engine wiring and listen for approaching footsteps, that I paid attention to Deucalion when he explained the design of the Argo.",
      "Perhaps then I could more easily cause this ship's destruction.",
      "The wires cut deeply into my fingers, drawing blood, but I ignore the pain.",
      "\"Ariadne.\"",
      "Somehow, it does not surprise me that it is Periboea who discovers me, that even on metal floors her footsteps are soundless.",
      "Her voice is soft and unsteady with horror.",
      "\"Ariadne,\" she whispers again.",
      "She presses her hand upon my wrist.",
      "For a moment I think she means to try and reason with me once more, then I feel the prick of a needle and numbness spreads up my arm.",
      "\"What....\" My thoughts slow, turn sluggish.",
      "I blink heavy eyelids.",
      "\"Peri....\" My lips feel swollen and I cannot properly shape her name with my mouth.",
      "\"You are mad with grief,\" Periboea whispers, fingers still tight around my wrist.",
      "\"If they discover what you just tried to do, they will kill you.\"",
      "Despite the numbness, I smile at the thought of Theseus's expression.",
      "Periboea swears.",
      "\"Athenian, Cretan, you are all mad,\" she says, and then her fingernails dig into my skin as she drags me away from the engines.",
      "She half-carries, half-drags me through the corridors, explaining my condition away with a quiet, \"Exhausted from grief, I think,\" to anyone who asks.",
      "I should be angry at her for thwarting my revenge, I know, but I cannot muster the emotion.",
      "Everything seems distant, my vision narrowing to pinpricks.",
      "I will be furious later, I think drowsily.",
      "She lowers me onto a seat, smoothes my hair away from my face.",
      "\"Ariadne,\" she says.",
      "I struggle to keep my eyes open, but her face wavers and blurs.",
      "\"I have set the escape pod's distress beacon to send out a call after five hours, once we are out of range.",
      "If you have any sense, you will not try to follow us.\"",
      "If I had any sense, I think, I would have looked past Theseus's looks and seen his callousness.",
      "I close my eyes, weary beyond belief.",
      "Perhaps Periboea kisses my forehead.",
      "Perhaps she simply sighs and steps away to the door of the escape pod.",
      "I cannot feel anything at all as I slump forward and welcome the darkness.",
      "When I awaken, I do so slowly, my head pounding.",
      "Someone holds my hands, turning them so that my palms face upwards.",
      "Presumably this is to study my damaged fingertips, which sting in a vague sort of way.",
      "I breathe in unsterilized air and realize I am no longer in the escape pod.",
      "My stomach roils and I keep my eyes shut for a moment, hoping that I do not vomit on whoever's taken me from the escape pod.",
      "\"That looks painful,\" a stranger murmurs as gentle fingers probe at my cuts.",
      "His voice is warm with concern and accented with an alien lilt.",
      "No Cretan or Athenian, the owner of this voice.",
      "\"Mother, do we have any skin and muscle repairing nanites in the infirmary?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" a woman answers, but there is something about her monotonous voice that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.",
      "A spike of adrenaline banishes the last of the sedative from my system.",
      "I force my eyes open and immediately wish I didn't.",
      "I'd been a fool before to think that Periboea had been genetically enhanced.",
      "She is exceedingly beautiful, but naturally so.",
      "The young man who kneels before me is so beautiful that it's painful.",
      "My eyes sting at the sight of his perfectly symmetrical features, the impossible purplish-blue of his eyes.",
      "I spot the tell-tale glitter of madness in his gaze and my breath catches in my throat.",
      "\"You're a god,\" I breathe through still-numb lips, the words only slightly slurred.",
      "I do not know who first called enhanced humans gods, but someone did once upon a time and the name stuck.",
      "The gods are powerful and unpredictable, their life-spans extending usually twenty years more than most humans, but mental instability goes hand in hand with their terrible beauty and power.",
      "\"No,\" the man says with a sardonic quirk of his lips that suggests he makes this correction often.",
      "\"My father is.",
      "My mother's human.\"",
      "He looks up, his smile softening.",
      "\"Aren't you, Mother?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" a woman answers, and now I realize why her voice unsettles me.",
      "The woman's voice comes from all around me, as though she is talking through a speaker.",
      "The man catches me staring.",
      "His smile turns crooked.",
      "\"I'm being rude.",
      "My name is Dionysus.\"",
      "\"Ariadne,\" I say automatically.",
      "\"Ariadne,\" he repeats, and the way he says my name makes me flush and jerk my hands away from his.",
      "He doesn't look offended.",
      "\"Ariadne, this is my mother, Semele.",
      "Mother, this is Ariadne.\"",
      "\"Hello, Ariadne,\" the woman says pleasantly as Dionysus gestures into the empty air.",
      "\"Well.",
      "Let me go get the nanites,\" Dionysus says, getting to his feet.",
      "He has laid me out on a bed, presumably his, for the room is small and cluttered with personal items.",
      "I spot my bag of belongings at the foot of the bed.",
      "Once he is gone, I sit up and blink at my surroundings.",
      "\"Um, I am sorry, Semele, but where are you?\" I say at last.",
      "\"If I am anywhere, I am situated in the ship's memory banks.",
      "I am the ship's artificial intelligence, based on the personality and memories of Dionysus's deceased mother.",
      "He persists in the delusion that I am in fact his mother rather than an electronic copy,\" the disembodied voice explains.",
      "There is a moment's pause.",
      "\"I do not advise trying to disabuse him of the delusion.",
      "His cousin Pentheus attempted it a year ago.\"",
      "\"What happened to Pentheus?\" I ask, suspecting I already know the answer.",
      "I do not think it possible for an A.I.'s voice to turn cold, but this one's does.",
      "\"He is deceased.\"",
      "Dionysus returns, bearing a medical supply box.",
      "The nanites quickly go to work on my fingertips, stitching together skin and speeding along the healing process.",
      "My fingers tingle and itch.",
      "I am almost grateful for the distraction when Dionysus asks, \"So how did you come to be in an escape pod with injured hands?\"",
      "For a moment I struggle to come up with a feasible lie, then I shrug.",
      "\"I was trying to sabotage a ship,\" I say.",
      "Dionysus's mouth twitches, though I cannot tell whether he is fighting a smile or a frown.",
      "I find that I cannot bring myself to care.",
      "At least my eyes have adjusted somewhat to his unnatural beauty.",
      "\"Did you succeed?\" he asks.",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"I am sorry,\" he says, actually sounding as though he means it.",
      "I find myself laughing, the sound edged with hysteria for a moment before it smoothes out into something more genuine.",
      "\"So am I,\" I say.",
      "I look towards the window where the stars seem smeared across the glass.",
      "\"Where are we going?\" Dionysus's reflection shrugs.",
      "\"Nowhere in particular,\" he says.",
      "\"Did you have a preference?\"",
      "\"Not Crete or Athens,\" I say.",
      "I cannot face my family, and I would be arrested as soon as I set foot on Athenian soil.",
      "I frown.",
      "\"You can drop me off at Naxos.",
      "I have no money--\" \"Mother likes you,\" Dionysus says, as though that means something.",
      "Perhaps to him it does.",
      "He smiles at me, and it's a half-wild, half-earnest look.",
      "\"You can stay on board as long as you like.\"",
      "He pauses.",
      "\"I could teach you how to properly sabotage a ship.\"",
      "Despite everything, my lips twitch into a weak smile.",
      "\"I think I would like that.\"",
      "Dionysus stuns me with his delighted grin that somehow intensifies his looks even more, his eyes sparkling with excitement.",
      "\"Wonderful!",
      "Mother, set the ship on autopilot.",
      "I'm going to show Ariadne how to make the engines blow up.\"",
      "\"Have fun, dear,\" the A.I. says.",
      "\"Welcome aboard, Ariadne.\"",
      "\"Thank you, Semele,\" I say, and let Dionysus lead the way."

    "text": "Hades said, \"Once upon a time there was a war.\" His face was all twisted up, dark and tired, lines carved into a rockface by the wind and the weather. I shrugged, hands in the pockets of my long grey sweater, \"Once upon a time there was a universe. What are you going to do about that?\" There was something fuzzy in my head. Everything was a little blurry and I was pretty drunk. I rocked back and forth on my feet, put out my hand against his wrist to steady myself. I thought probably he was drunk too, and twisted my fingers through his. his rings were thick and gold, heavy and warm from his flesh. \"Keep dreaming of victory,\" he sighed. There was very little warmth in his voice. He smelled like woodsmoke and rosemary. Orpheus sees me in the sunshine. \"Persephone,\" he calls, throwing a long golden arm up to beckon me. I am sitting at the window in my favourite cafe, picking apart a blueberry scone. The sun is hot on my golden hair and I am looking at the reflection of the girl in the window: she does not look pale and drawn and wan, she looks beautiful and sweet and alive. It is not an accurate reflection, I am thinking. I has been a long time since Isaw him, this boy with the guitar slung over his back, dark liner smudged about his eyes. He has been playing at something of which he has no knowledge, but there is something lovely about that - something delicate. I've never been able to protect anyone but I slide to my feet, pulling my coat around me. \"Hey,\" I say, smiling as wide as I can remember how. I think I put on lipstick this morning; I wonder if my mouth is too red. I have a sunshine wardrobe and one for the dark but sometimes they get confused. His eyes are dark blue, bright against his dark hair. He smiles back but there's an edge, something bitter in the smooth curve of his mouth. He pulls his dark sleeves down past his knuckles, threading through all the people to my side. \"Hey,\" he murmurs back, putting his guitar down beside him. I kiss his cheek and sit down. \"How are you?\" He shakes his head. \"I--\" Need your help, I hear. \"I can't,\" I say. \"There's - you have the wrong girl.\" My scone is crumbs, now. Orpheus' fingers twitch on the formica table. His eyelashes are too long as he looks away. \"I don't know where else to go.\" I think, I too was once in love, but. Look how that ended up. I was fifteen, okay? It sounds better - it sounds less awful - if you remember that. I wasn't a smart fifteen. I was a drunk fifteen, I was rebellious and I hated everyone and I dyed my hair black, slashed holes in my shirts and when my mother stared at me like she didn't know who I was it just made me angrier. I was fifteen and I had a really fucking good fake and an impressive self-destruct drive and I was in love with the idea of being someone who'd die in a furious shootout, the kind of girl who'd feature in a Warhol film, the girl that bad boys remembered fondly as the one that got away. I'm sure now that my mother had regular heart attacks but I didn't care, of course I didn't. I was fifteen years old. I was beautiful and I wanted to die and there's really nothing more seductive, more dangerous than that. I will never be as powerful as I was then. Or as helpless. He told me I was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen and kissed me to the first Pixies track I'd ever heard and like. What was I to do with that? Orpheus' fingernails are bitten down to the quick, all callous and red hangnail. He does not look like he has been sleeping but there are a number of reasons for that; he could be one of my people. They're not mine. And he's not. He pushes his hair out of his eyes and says, \"I need to get her back.\" \"Eurydice,\" I remember. A tall girl; short skirt, grey eyes, sweet smile. Her mouth had been very red but they all are, the first time. She'd been flushed and breathless and tripping over her own spike heels. I always worry about them but I'm not fifteen anymore; all I do is worry. \"Yes,\" he says. It sounds like all I have in the world. The first time I met him was underground. He was playing, spotlight on his blue-black hair, fingers light on the strings of his beautiful guitar. He'd looked tired, out of place, but that didn't matter because listening to him was like swallowing the sun. It shone out of him, out of the music and the slight curve of his lips. I'd wrapped my fingers around my drink and stopped to watch. I didn't swallow whatever was on my tongue; I didn't have to. I say, \"She's down deep, now.\" He sighs. \"I can't let her be there alone.\" The first time, I had been alone. My mouth tasted like the two pills I'd had before I came and the two I'd had pressed into my tongue by the rough pads of his fingers. He asked my name and I told him; Persephone curling out from my mouth like a promise, pressed up against the shell of his ear. I didn't know anything about him. He was tall and handsome and tired and he talked like there was something between us, some secret story that both of us knew bits of and if we talked long enough we'd assemble it and it would be the meaning of the universe, forty-two. I was wearing a thrift-store dress that was mostly holes. My skin had gotten pale. I felt young with him but that made it beautiful. Like I had this whole world to stretch my mind through, like he was going to keep me safe. I don't know my father. It's classic, okay. The club was his. Of course it was. Is. We didn't fuck in the back room; I checked my hair in the mirror by his desk and he ran his huge broad hand along the slope of my spine and murmured that I was beautiful. We sat out on the fire escape and smoked, nicotine coiling through my cells. His lips parted, exhaling whiteness like little clouds of pesticide dispersing bright and deadly across the fields of corn. I burned my wrist on the end of my cigarette. It took me a moment too long to feign surprise but he stroked his thumb along the line of bone and pressed down like he didn't care. I say, \"You lost, Orpheus.\" He shakes his head. \"Please-\" His eyes are the pleading dark. \"You doubted,\" I say, gently. \"And what makes you think I have power there, anyway?\" The fruit, candied and too sweet, is sitting heavily in my stomach. It reminds me of every bad decision I've ever made. I don't even know how I found it. I wasn't supposed to. Nobody's supposed to - it finds you. Sometimes you just - you make a mistake. You walk through a hidden door and end up in a whole new world. Suck my clit, Alice in Wonderland. Sometimes your mistakes are somebody else's big grand plan. Orpheus said, \"please.\" The notes of his song rung through his voice, rung through my chest. He was sixteen, maybe. Sixteen, and in love, and I don't know how either of them found their way down here but they shouldn't have. It called Eurydice, I know. She has the eyes of a girl who was called. He must have followed her. I had never seen anyone follow someone down before. I touched his wrist, his unblemished wrist with its strong guitarist's muscle. I have always been easy for beautiful boys with beautiful pleading eyes. My mother calls me sweetheart with this sad note in her voice. I think she misses me. \"Okay,\" I said. \"Okay.\" (There are, I suppose, alternate universes where I said no. Maybe he is happier there. Maybe he can blame me.) They called him the king of the underworld. I gleamed on his arm, sunlight in my hair; the best jewelery you've ever seen. He brought me a diamond crown, black diamonds that shone like fire under the disco ball lights. We took drugs together and I collected bruises, track marks that I hid with huge bracelets and shredded long-sleeved shirts. My mother left a hundred messages on my phone and I threw it away, let the battery wind down and chucked it in the backpack of my least favourite dealer. \"You're mine,\" he murmured, late at night, early in the morning; I twisted my face into his shoulder and thought it love. \"Please,\" I said. He looked at me with those dark end of the world eyes. \"Are you sure? You know what it will be like, for her.\" I remembered how the sunlight had stabbed my eyes, how Hecate's arms caught me carefully, like I was something fragile. (I was, you know. Truces only come along so often.) Orpheus' eyes were rocks on my shoulders, dragging me to the bottom of the ocean. I could feel the seaweed wrapping around my throat. I snuck a breath. \"Yes.\" He smelled like smoke and I don't know what I smelled like, expensive perfume and champagne, probably, with absinthe dabbed at my wrists. I woke up in silk sheets to the moon rising; I ate little, growing thinner and paler by the day. It was so easy, all of it; like a dream. I had spent fifteen years trying to get to that dream. I did not want to wake up. Was it any wonder it hurt like it did, to wake? Orpheus stood in front of us, sunlight gleaming in the blue of his eyes, as though he had caught it there for us. His fingertips rested on the strings of his guitar, sunlight and longing rippling through the chords and into my throat, humming there steady and dangerous, like hope. \"You can't turn around,\" Hades said, his arm around my shoulders. \"She has to do it on her own.\" I remembered my wobbly knees, the way my eyes had burned on the way out. She smiled, raw and nervous. I could see the jittery spark already going in the back of her eyes. \"Good luck,\" I said, softly. I did not know who I was saying it to. The smell of woodsmoke wreathed us. I raised my hand like goodbye but I knew it was really see you in a minute. I did not see him for a long, long time. \"Let her out.\" Hecate was furious, incandescent, a dark-haired woman with more vibrancy to her than I'd seen in years underground. \"Her mother's furious, Hades.\" I swayed on my feet, looking back and forth between the two of them. The drink in my hand was like a lifeline. I closed my fingers around the stem and thought about my mother's low-pitched voice, about gunfire in the streets. Hades' frown was a thunderstorm, lightning snapping in the black of his eyes. I had never seen him so angry. \"She's mine, Hecate.\" \"How much have you had?\" she asked. Her eyes met mine, slate-grey, flat. \"Um,\" I said. My mouth hurt. \"Hecate?\" My heels clicked across the ground. I was pacing, I think. It was hard to know what to do. \"She's not hooked,\" he said, like he was trying to convince someone. I don't think her - maybe it was me, maybe it was him. \"I wouldn't do that to her.\" \"Because she's Demeter's?\" Hecate snapped. \"But you'd do it to all the others.\" \"Fuck, Hecate,\" he said. \"That's not what this is. It helps them.\" He looked at me, then, with those huge dark eyes. He knew he had lost, I think. Nobody was surprised when Eurydice came back, shaking in her heels with her hair falling limp around her face. \"He turned around,\" she said. \"I couldn't do it, after that.\" Her voice was low, resigned. Her nails were black against the railing of the staircase: black iron, winding and ornate, like a fairytale where everyone dies by the end. \"I'm sorry,\" I said. I put my hand on her wrist, as gentle as I could manage. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath of the stale, alcohol-laden air. \"Me too.\" I took pills for the walk out. I shouldn't have. It was my undoing. I had to come back, after that. \"You turned around,\" I say. I can see my own reflection in his sharp eyes; I look translucent, washed out, thanks to his proximity. I am getting worse and worse at managing this double act. \"Fuck,\" he swears. \"Fuck, I - I thought she'd fallen.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I say. \"People aren't - kind - when there is a war on.\" I get up. Standing is a strange effort; my muscles have forgotten how to behave. My knees do not buckle but it is a close thing. There are callouses on his fingertips when he catches my wrist, the prints of them heavy on my fragile paper-thin skin. \"Don't leave.\" The sun is in his eyes, on his hair. I sit back down. His ankle brushes mine. It is very, very warm. It has been a while since I was in the sunlight. I do not have to be underground for a long while, yet. He says, \"You and the boy.\" His eyelashes are dark, catching the stage lights in them. Orpheus is not on stage. He won't be, not for a long time. It is all bare dark wood, now. Bare wood and suspicious stains and the lights running all over everything, too bright for this world. I catch Eurydice's eye. She is in the crowd, a pale slip of a girl; she waves, conducting an invisible orchestra in a mourning dirge. I say, \"You have no power in the daylight.\" My voice is sharper than I mean it to be, but we have lived with each other a long time. We will live with each other a long time. There is something in his eyes that I cannot read. \"All right,\" he says. There is a janitor's closet in the back of the club. It's small and dimly lit and there is a tiny, rectangular window in the top left corner. Before I left, he pressed a packet into my pocket, murmured don't open it till later. The light here is weak, thin. It spills the yellow of weak tea across my fingers as I fumble it out of my pocket. Grape seeds. His handwriting on the back is thin, all loose loops. I know you'll help. \"Oh, Orpheus,\" I whisper. The smell of his aftershave is still in the fall of my hair. I lick my lips. They taste like summer.",

    "text": "Ariadne has a brother who is a secret, who is a monster. She does not know he is a monster yet: for that is the secret, and she does not even know he is her brother, for that comes later. She has heard the howls at night, of course, but it is a very long intuitive leap from mysterious noises to minotaur, so she is to be forgiven for not figuring it out sooner. What she does know is that her mother cries sometimes, when she thinks Ariadne is asleep. Ariadne's mother is a queen, because Ariadne's father is a king, which makes Ariadne a princess. Ariadne knows she is not a very good princess - she climbs too many trees and tears too many dresses, has too little patience for tapestries and two left feet for dancing. She is a very good climber, however. She is up a tree right now - the tallest one on the entire island. From here she can see out beyond the sea, can almost make out the silhouettes of distant lands. She has lived on this island ever since she was born, and has always wondered what it would be to leave - but wondered in an aimless sort of way, as a philosophical question rather than a practical exercise. She does not know where she would go, knows no place other than this. \"I like being up high,\" says a voice. \"You can see the whole world from up here.\" She looks down, startled. There is a boy in her tree, peering up at her from the branches beneath. She does not know his name yet. She knows his face though - she saw him last week, standing behind his father. His father is an inventor and he came to the court a few weeks ago, although she does not know why. This might be her chance to find out. \"I know you,\" she says. \"You're the inventor's son.\" The boy puffs out his shoulders. \"I am,\" he says. \"My name's Icarus.\" \"I'm Ariadne,\" she says. \"This is my tree.\" \"It's a marvellous tree,\" he says. \"Thank you,\" she says - and then, she decides to ask him about something she has been wondering for weeks. \"What is that?\" she asks, pointing to the outlines of corridors and stones and half-walled structures she has peering \"It looks like a maze.\" She's fairly sure it is a maze, although parts are walled off so that she cannot just solve it while looking at it. It is made of wood and shrubs and stones, strange concentric circles and designs, and imposing walls. She hopes it is a puzzle. She loves puzzles - has always been good at mulling things over, piecing things together. They both peer down. Ariadne can almost see a shadow moving at the centre of it, although that could just be her imagination. \"It's a labyrinth my father built for the king. It's more secure than any locked room, and my father has the key in his head,\" Icarus says proudly. She peers at it with new curiousity. \"What's kept inside this labyrinth?\" \"A secret,\" says Icarus grandly. She looks at him accusingly. \"You mean, you don't know.\" Icarus flushes. \"I do know! I just can't tell you.\" \"If you knew, you'd tell me.\" \"I can't,\" says Icarus, and he sounds sullen. \"Fine,\" says Ariadne, shrugging, because the sun is shining and she has better things to do today than unravel the secrets of this mysterious boy. \"Do you want to race back to the palace?\" She is higher up the tree than Icarus, but this is her tree, and her feet are nimble, and she is the first one to touch the ground, her blonde hair streaming behind her as she runs. Icarus is close at her heels, but she reaches the palace first, turns to him laughing. She decides that Icarus will make a fine friend for her, even if he does sulk sometimes. Perhaps tomorrow they can climb some more trees, and she can coax some stories out of him, about other cities he must have been too. Ariadne asks her mother that night what the secret is, at the heart of the labyrinth, and her mother does not answer - just goes very white, as if Ariadne had hit her, and after that Ariadne is sent to her room while the king and queen confer in hushed voices. Her mother cries again that night, and again the next morning. Ariadne does not see Icarus after that - he and his father are taken away the next day to a tower. She asks her mother why they had to go. Her mother tells her to stay away from both of them, not to listen to a word they say - they are traitors and liars and madmen. A few months later, Ariadne is sitting in the courtyard of the palace, playing with her new kitten. A door bursts open, and she sees Daedalus heading towards her - and he certainly does look mad, his beard is ragged and his clothes are dirty. He smells of musty rooms and candle wax. \"Hello,\" Ariadne says, for she is always polite. He does not answer. \"You always need a spare key,\" he mumbles to himself, and Ariadne thinks to herself that perhaps her mother was right, Daedalus must be a madman. His eyes focus on her. \"Can you keep a secret?\" he says, urgently. Ariadne nods, because she can. He picks up the skein of thread her kitten is playing with, and presses the end into her palm. \"This is the secret to the labyrinth,\" he says. \"When he comes, tell him that.\" \"Tell who?\" she asks. Her kitten pounces at the other end of the thread, teasing out its length. But Daedalus is not paying attention, she can tell - his gaze is fixed on something beyond her, and his eyes are alight with something akin to hope. The guards come rushing out then, to take him back to the tower - as they force his hands behind his back, he winks at her. \"Remember,\" he mouths, and then he looks up into the sky again, with those bright eyes. She turns around to see what Daedalus was looking at, but all she sees is a bird.",

Apollo barely paused in his recital of some piece-or-other as he inclined his head, and automatically Dionysus poured his brother another glass of wine. \"Oh, well isn't this a picture of domestic bliss?\" Persephone's voice came up behind them. \"Oh go away\" Apollo paused the flow of music, setting down his lyre. Dionysus sat up and threw a pine cone at her. \"Shut up and sit down.\" He said to her, as she swatted it away.\"Oh, I don't know. I wouldn't want to interrupt you two.\" She smiled coyly and sat cross legged next to Dionysus, their knees touching. \"Oh please, I was just waiting for something to stop Apollo, I was getting a headache.\" Dionysus drawled, pouring another goblet of wine for Persephone. \"Excuse you, my music does not cause ailments of any kind! It's probably the wine going to your head.\"\"There's definitely something going to my head, all right.\" He smirked, his eyes following a nearby nymph. \"Oh disgusting.\" Persephone swatted at his arm.\"You sound just like Artemis, Persephone.\" Apollo's fingers couldn't keep still and he began drumming on his thigh \"Persephone/ fooling nobody/ we all know she's perverted/ just like Dionysus.\" He began composing. Rolling her eyes, Persephone asked \"How is Ariadne?\"\"As sweet as ever.\" Dionysus gave his standard answer, and a little half smile at the thought of his wife. \"How's Demeter?\"\"Lamenting my marriage, as usual.\" Persephone sipped her wine as her brothers sniggered. \"Winter's coming soon, isn't it?\" Apollo made a face, \"And we'll be losing you to Hades' dark clutches all over again.\"\"I can't wait!\" Persephone grinned.\"Those are the words of a girl who hasn't got laid properly in several months.\" Apollo nodded.\"Just how do you cope?\" Dionysus asked. \"If I were ever separated from my wife for six months at a time, not that would ever happen of course, I'd be jumping everything in sight.\"\"Yes, because that's so different to how you are now.\" Apollo chimed in.\"Shut up.\"\"No you.\"Persephone waited for them to finish before answering \"Oh you know, I have endless amounts of patience and virtue..\" \"She's sneaking out.\" Apollo suggested immediately.\"Oh yes, she's got that glowing look of post-sex happiness.\"\"Now that you mention it, that's a very good idea.\"\"Like you haven't thought of it before.\" Dionysus elbowed Apollo, and ignoring her protests added \"We've taught her well\"\"We're brilliant teachers.\"\"You should write a song about it.\"\"Oh I have a song! I made it up!\" Persephone interrupted.\"Oh?\" Apollo inclined his head, interested.\"Apollo and Dion, sitting under a tree, doing what they shouldn't be, first comes sex, then comes feelings--\"\"---Please don't ever sing again.\" Apollo interrupted quickly.\"Yow, way to destroy music.\" Dionysus complained. \"My poor heart cries tears of blood to see such an abuse, no intonation, no tune! O! Woe!\" \"There there, Apollo. She'll be going to Hades soon.\" Dionysus patted his brothers shoulder.\"Oh har har, very funny. Your wit is golden.\" \"Some may say I have the golden touch.\"\"No, Dionysus that's me!\" Apollo complained.\"Sure Sure, if you like.\"\"I do like.\"\"Well then, your way is clear.\"\"It's like a ray of golden light hath shined down upon my path.\"\"You two are such dorks.\" Persephone stood up. \"And as much as I would love to stay and talk nothing with you, some of us have chores to do.\"\"What on earth do you do? You work the least out of all of us!\" Apollo cried indignantly.\"No one works less than Dionysus.\" Persephone retorted quickly. \"Hey, no hate.

    "text": "What Demeter understands about Poseidon, that others don't, is that her brother is the sea. As surely as he is to come crashing into a situation he will retreat, he will always retract into his own mind. He is everything she knows and desires but can never completely hold. She is the mountain slowly weathered away by the constant thrusting of the sea. Does she love him? She strokes his hair mindlessly, strong fingers working through the dark black tangles that have grown hard from excess salt. He is distracted today, dark blue eyes filled with a melancholy she had never seen in him before. The action itself had a tenderness to it, sisterly even, but the action was merely a consequence of what they had done before. Like Hera and Zeus they had blurred the lines, but Poseidon would never make Demeter his wife, and she would never accept even if he wanted to. She knew that he would always retreat from her elsewhere, and she would remain constantly worn down by him. A marriage would never work. She waits for him to speak, but he does not, and she cannot fathom what he is thinking. The sea today is the same as him, detached and quiet. Not calm but not raging either, making mortals stop and wonder what was beneath the surface. Many a proud swimmer would drown today in an effort to find out. \"What is it Poseidon, you are driving me mad with concern.\" She snapped, unable to take it anymore. She shifted her legs so that he had no option but to remove his head from her lap. Her little brother looked at her with narrowed eyes, flashing with boiling emotion that she did not comprehend. \"Nothing.\" He replied shortly, and the crash of waves accentuated the short two syllables of his reply. She frowned, she had always counted on their pairing being the strongest. Hera and Zeus were together, but they always fought, they did not mesh. Hetia and Hades were only lumped together because they were the quietest, and she and Poseidon had an understanding, a friendship that went so deep it was rooted inside of her and she didn't think she could ever let him go fully. He sighed, a sigh that resounded from his chest. \"I am lovesick. Lovesick for Amphitrite but she runs from me.\" He admitted finally. Demeter stayed silent. \"She runs and I do not understand why.\" Poseidon runs too, Demeter thought shrewdly. He and Amphitrite will be a colourful couple to say the least if they both retreat so often from each other. \"You run to me when you should run after her.\" she says kindly, the love she bears for him as a sister over riding any complex she has for him as a lover. She kisses his lips softly, chastely, so different to how they kissed but an hour before. \"Prove your love, brother, and she will come to you. Perhaps this time, is you're serious, you should not pursue.\" She knows it is against his nature, for he and the waves are one, and they always come towards the shore to take before returning home, satisfied. She wonders if Amphitrite will ever understand that to know Poseidon is to not know him, that he is as secret as the sea floor and unfathomable as sea foam. He is the sea, and Demeter the cliffs that fall into it. She wonders what Amphitrite will become.",

    "text": "Rebirth is such a difficult thing, every time. First there must come the leaving; even balanced by the gain on the other side, their parting is always sharp, and hard to bear. \"It seems so simple,\" he muses, down in the darkness, examining the petals of one of her delicate silver-sheen nightblooms as close as he would a soul bound for judgment. \"Pushing up through the earth, and opening. So much easier than returning below.\" But it isn't, she wants to say. All that weight above, all the light and heat and joy she knows awaits, but having to put forth the effort, to push through the suffocating space between, and all in the shell of such a fragile thing. She is well used to death; it is her constant companion for half the year, and she is used to birth as well. But to have them follow so close on one another is a thing only a god could endure, she thinks, and even then, she is the sole one among them to endure it with such regularity. She says none of this, but perhaps he knows nonetheless, wrapping his arms around her in an embrace strong as the earth's, breathing against her ear. \"I'll be there. I am always with you.\" He never breaks; never so much as cracks, though she wonders at times if he might want to, if he finds the weight of the Underworld too much to carry, the bargain he's made with her too difficult to keep. If he ever grows tired of being the ghost of the gods, the darkness that they shun despite his wisdom, despite the way he shoulders his kingdom with an ease born of tight discipline. \"I know you are,\" she murmurs against the cool skin of his shoulder, and savors this last moment, tangling her fingers in his black curls as though she could hold onto him forever. Then she breathes in his kingdom, and dies. For a split second that lasts an eternity, she hangs alone, a bright seed in the black. When she wakes again, as she must, blooming under the sunlight, it's to the taste of fruit on her lips, and a voice humming around her, fingers moving against her shoulder, keeping time. \"You ought to leave music to Apollo,\" she says drowsily, without opening her eyes. \"It isn't your strong suit.\" \"My strong suit is whatever I choose, my dear,\" he says mildly. She breathes in spring, warm and damp, deliciously scented, and relishes the feeling of his skin under hers, hot and so very much alive. \"Your strong suit is being vain and grandiose-\" \"And utterly perfect?\" he interrupts, bending so his shadow falls over her face, casting her eyes into shade, before pressing his lips to hers. He tastes of honey and spice, wine and nectar, drowning her senses like a river, heating her straight through her core, leaving her flushed and breathless, her mind swimming in a pleasant haze. She forgets, every time, how tactile it is to be above; how tactile he is. He is never still, never at rest; their encounters leave her always gasping for more, aching to possess him in a way that never quite comes to fruition, their pairings frenzied and filled to overflowing with passion and abandon. \"Isn't it better this way?\" he whispers, laying himself over her, his hands skimming over her skin, making her blood come alive to run and sing like sap through the waking trees. \"Isn't it better here?\" No, she thinks, but doesn't answer aloud, twining her hands in his copper hair and wrapping her legs tight around him, determined to match him here, to make this mutual as they become part of each other. Afterward, when they lay spent in the grass, feeling new growth spring up beneath her, tickling along her spine, she tells him, \"There is no better. There is only different.\" They lie hardly connected now, physically; only their hands joined, his thumb stroking over her knuckles with barely restrained energy. \"Did you think I should love the bright more than the dark,\" she asks, turning her face to his, watching the sudden wariness in his eyes, so like an animal tensing to flee, \"simply because it is bright?\" He contains his impulses with a visible effort, jaw working as he breaks their gaze and looks up to the sky, and she thinks in that moment that she can see a flash of Hades in him, in the restraint and discipline. \"This is your world,\" he says thickly. \"Where you belong. Why should you not prefer it, every part and piece of it?\" \"Because we learn to change,\" she says, and shifts to lie against him, the sheen of sweat on her skin cooling, leaving her chilled; as ever, he burns from within. \"Because the light cannot exist without the darkness, nor wild abandon without measured control. All things must have their counter.\" She can sense his frown in the way his muscles twitch beneath her, restless. He has ever been this way, all or nothing, from one side of the pendulum to the other, while she serves as his fulcrum point, the balance of the aspects between them. Still, he quiets beneath her touch, and his breathing slows, his acceptance of her wisdom bestowed in a kiss pressed to the waves of her hair, in his arms wrapping tight around her. \"I'll need to run,\" he says eventually, as the stars brighten the sky above them. \"The Maenads will have their dance.\" \"Of course,\" she says, for this is a constant; there are always other concerns, other duties, other adventures before them. And she has her own life to renew, to create while she still can. \"You must live your summer, as I live mine. But not yet. That is for the morning, and a new sunrise.\" Lips pressed to his shoulder, she breathes him in; honey and spice and wine, and below that the dark chill of the earth, lingering still.",

      "She says none of this, but perhaps he knows nonetheless, wrapping his arms around her in an embrace strong as the earth's, breathing against her ear.",
      "\"I'll be there.",
      "I am always with you.\"",
      "He never breaks; never so much as cracks, though she wonders at times if he might want to, if he finds the weight of the Underworld too much to carry, the bargain he's made with her too difficult to keep.",
      "If he ever grows tired of being the ghost of the gods, the darkness that they shun despite his wisdom, despite the way he shoulders his kingdom with an ease born of tight discipline.",
      "\"I know you are,\" she murmurs against the cool skin of his shoulder, and savors this last moment, tangling her fingers in his black curls as though she could hold onto him forever.",
      "Then she breathes in his kingdom, and dies.",
      "For a split second that lasts an eternity, she hangs alone, a bright seed in the black.",
      "When she wakes again, as she must, blooming under the sunlight, it's to the taste of fruit on her lips, and a voice humming around her, fingers moving against her shoulder, keeping time.",
      "\"You ought to leave music to Apollo,\" she says drowsily, without opening her eyes.",
      "\"It isn't your strong suit.\"",
      "\"My strong suit is whatever I choose, my dear,\" he says mildly.",
      "She breathes in spring, warm and damp, deliciously scented, and relishes the feeling of his skin under hers, hot and so very much alive.",
      "\"Your strong suit is being vain and grandiose-\" \"And utterly perfect?\" he interrupts, bending so his shadow falls over her face, casting her eyes into shade, before pressing his lips to hers.",
      "He tastes of honey and spice, wine and nectar, drowning her senses like a river, heating her straight through her core, leaving her flushed and breathless, her mind swimming in a pleasant haze.",
      "She forgets, every time, how tactile it is to be above; how tactile he is.",
      "He is never still, never at rest; their encounters leave her always gasping for more, aching to possess him in a way that never quite comes to fruition, their pairings frenzied and filled to overflowing with passion and abandon.",
      "\"Isn't it better this way?\" he whispers, laying himself over her, his hands skimming over her skin, making her blood come alive to run and sing like sap through the waking trees.",
      "\"Isn't it better here?\"",
      "No, she thinks, but doesn't answer aloud, twining her hands in his copper hair and wrapping her legs tight around him, determined to match him here, to make this mutual as they become part of each other.",
      "Afterward, when they lay spent in the grass, feeling new growth spring up beneath her, tickling along her spine, she tells him, \"There is no better.",
      "There is only different.\"",
      "They lie hardly connected now, physically; only their hands joined, his thumb stroking over her knuckles with barely restrained energy.",
      "\"Did you think I should love the bright more than the dark,\" she asks, turning her face to his, watching the sudden wariness in his eyes, so like an animal tensing to flee, \"simply because it is bright?\"",
      "He contains his impulses with a visible effort, jaw working as he breaks their gaze and looks up to the sky, and she thinks in that moment that she can see a flash of Hades in him, in the restraint and discipline.",
      "\"This is your world,\" he says thickly.",
      "\"Where you belong.",
      "Why should you not prefer it, every part and piece of it?\"",
      "\"Because we learn to change,\" she says, and shifts to lie against him, the sheen of sweat on her skin cooling, leaving her chilled; as ever, he burns from within.",
      "\"Because the light cannot exist without the darkness, nor wild abandon without measured control.",
      "All things must have their counter.\"",
      "She can sense his frown in the way his muscles twitch beneath her, restless.",
      "He has ever been this way, all or nothing, from one side of the pendulum to the other, while she serves as his fulcrum point, the balance of the aspects between them.",
      "Still, he quiets beneath her touch, and his breathing slows, his acceptance of her wisdom bestowed in a kiss pressed to the waves of her hair, in his arms wrapping tight around her.",
      "\"I'll need to run,\" he says eventually, as the stars brighten the sky above them.",
      "\"The Maenads will have their dance.\"",
      "\"Of course,\" she says, for this is a constant; there are always other concerns, other duties, other adventures before them.",
      "And she has her own life to renew, to create while she still can.",
      "\"You must live your summer, as I live mine.",
      "But not yet.",
      "That is for the morning, and a new sunrise.\"",
      "Lips pressed to his shoulder, she breathes him in; honey and spice and wine, and below that the dark chill of the earth, lingering still."
